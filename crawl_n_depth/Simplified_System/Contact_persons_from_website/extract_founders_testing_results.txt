Search Text: Will and Luke started the academy as startup-style accelerator for non-tech peeps, with a social impact focus. We ran our main accelerator in 2014 with 25 students and 40 teachers + mentors in Donkey Wheel house. Since, we’ve worked with researchers, universities, funds and accelerators to figure out different ways to do education. In early 2016 we decided to go online-first, so we can reach the whole world by default, when we partnered up with the Telstra Foundation. Our teaching approach was originally inspired by Will’s grandfather, refined through countless classes, workshops, intensives, seminars, mentoring programs and wine-drenched heart-to-hearts
