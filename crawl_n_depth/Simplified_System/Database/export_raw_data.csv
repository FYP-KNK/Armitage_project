Not because they are seemingly unrelated. But because there are overlapping elements of ‘culture’ which are easily overlooked or forgotten  as I was quick to experience in my visit to Festool. Referring again to definitions  it is noteworthy that many describe STEM in much broader terms than its component subjects of science  technology  engineering and mathematics. Definitions include an “enterprise that operates with a social license”  which is “truly global” and “bridges cultural divide” (Office of the Chief Scientist  2013). STEM “contributes to personal  social  and economic outcomes” (Timms  Moyle  Weldon  & Mitchell  2018). STEM outcomes are “cultural achievements that reflect people’s humanity” (National Research Council  2011)  and “broaden student understanding of STEM disciplines through exposure to culturally relevant STEM contexts” (Moore  2008). Comparing these definitions with the rationale for languages as stated in the Australian Curriculum (AC) makes for interesting reading  where “language capabilities represent linguistic and cultural resources through which the community can engage socially  culturally and economically  in domains which include business  trade  science…health and communications” (ACARA  2018). And notably the rationale from the International Baccalaureate (IB) which aims to “enable students to understand and use the language they have studied in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes” (International Baccalaureate  2014). There is certainly an overlap. Ironically  the introduction of computers into schools was meant to be part of the solution. Who can forget the bold claims of a ‘digital education revolution’ made by Kevin Rudd in the 2007 labour election campaign? The benefit to trade and technical students  to the study of sciences and chemistry  and the turbo charging of foreign language learning that computers would facilitate was certainly a vision. But the results have been lacklustre. Despite the above  thousands of teachers have tried to move the needle on this issue and are doing great work.

He distinguishes disruptive technologies from what he calls sustaining technologies  in that sustaining technologies “improve the performance of established products  along the dimensions of performance that mainstream customers in major markets have historically valued. Most technological advances in a given industry are sustaining in character”. In other words  we like it when the products and services we buy continue to get incrementally better. According to Christensen  managers generally allocate resources to such innovations because it makes sense to do so. Seems obvious  right? By contrast  disruptive technologies “bring to market a very different value proposition that had been available previously. Generally  disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally new) customers value” (Christensen  2000). Historically  managers have been hesitant to allocate resources to disruptive innovations because it doesn’t make sense to do so. Schools can learn from this dichotomy. What if the STEM and language declines could be turned by an unknown or nonsensical value proposition? Not that we ignored it. It’s just that making classes work in unusual combinations is difficult  especially when students are mostly choosing other subjects. It doesn’t make sense to allocate resources that way.
