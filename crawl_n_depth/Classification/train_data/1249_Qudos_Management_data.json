While most of these requirements could be inferred from various parts of the previous standard, the concentration of them in a list in a single clause suggests something more. As a general observation, the standard as a whole seems to be less prescriptive than its predecessor in how various requirements will be met \u2013 but this clause seems to run contrary to that trend by being more prescriptive.

The existing general requirements also state that where an organisation outsources any process that affects conformity to requirements, the organisation shall ensure control over that process. Outsourcing is defined as a process which the organisation chooses to have performed by an external party. So, what are the significant changes for the new standard? Well, once again the R-word comes into play. Organisations are required to take a risk-based approach to the required controls. You may be forgiven for thinking that is not such a significant change.

That way, we have something definite to aim for, and can clearly establish whether we have achieved the objective. In most cases, we should be able to track progress as we work towards the objective. Before setting an objective, we need to know the current situation, and might have to obtain some form of data or statistics to establish that.", "Some organizations put generic objectives in their quality policy or manual e.g. ", "'we will offer the fastest delivery possible'", " and back that up with something more precise e.g. ", "'Over the next 12 months, we will deliver 95% of orders within 48 hours'", ".

Ask yourself this question...Would anyone really care if we met the target or not? If the answer is no, then perhaps the objective doesn't warrant setting in the first place. Just like other aspects of the quality system, your objectives should be relevant to the needs and expectations of the organization and interested parties \u2013 like your customers.

We might consider where the best opportunities are for improvement. Using the Pareto Principle (or 80:20) rule, we could prioritise our efforts to where the greatest benefit may be achieved. The various individuals or business units may be given different objectives that reflect their scope for improvement.", "In view of the above, an example might be that we have become aware of customer concern about deliveries not always being on time. We may have learnt that from a customer survey or perhaps just from anecdotal evidence. Taking on board the customer concern, we may decide to undertake a sampling of our current delivery performance. This will give us a benchmark on which to base any improvement initiatives. If an examination of current delivery performance reveals that on average we deliver 90% of orders within 48 hours, rather than arbitrarily setting a target of say improving to 95% by the end of this year, we might look at what improvement is realistically possible.", "Improvement initiatives might include a 'Cause and effect' analysis to establish what causes the late deliveries, and perhaps do some brainstorming to establish what improvement actions can be taken. It may then be possible to get a clearer idea of what can be achieved by them. Having looked at all the contributory factors, we might only realistically expect to hit 93% this year.
