However, it provided a steady voltage and made important contributions to new experiments and discoveries, including the electrolysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen.", "In 1836 British chemist John Daniell developed a more practical battery. It used two different electrolytes separated by a porous ceramic barrier. This allowed ions to pass through the barrier without the electrolyte solutions mixing.
