It was tough going due to the altitude and the severity of the ascent.", "We had rest time at the top, Dead Woman\u2019s Pass, before a two hour descent down more steep wet steps to our camp site. It was a pity we did not get a view from the top as it was raining steadily.", "The third day again started early with another steep & climb up more steps for about 1.5 hours past more Inca ruins (I was getting over stairs!).", "Finally we were at the top before descending to the next rest stop. The track was undulating for the rest of the day to camp, passing through rain forest along the way and more Inca ruins. We had a very early start on the last day and were up at 3am. We started walking to Machu Picchu park gate by torch light and waited until dawn at 5:30am before entering the park. We could see large mountains and glaciers in the distance. The last set of stairs at last were extremely steep and aptly named the \u2018Monkey Wall\u2019.

Child birth pain for example, not that I will ever know what that feels like. Nevertheless, I have had numerous experiences of back pain that are seared into my memory. On one occasion, an early morning answer to the call of nature found me on all fours on my bathroom floor. I managed to crawl back to my bedroom but could go no further. The slightest movement of any muscle in any direction set off excruciating muscle spasms in my lower back. Eventually, after what seemed like hours in that position, my son returned from night clubbing and managed to help me back into bed.", "On another occasion, I emerged from a crowded train at Flinders Street station, only to have my back go into spasms which caused me to drop my backpack and stagger to a stanchion for support. I tried desperately to rub some heat into my lower back to get myself moving again but to no avail. After about half an hour, I attracted the attention of a station attendant who shouldered my backpack and assisted me up an escalator so I could catch a train home. I remember not being able to stand or sit on the train without agonising spasms wracking my body.", "As I grew older, the frequency of lower back episodes was increasing as well as the duration of the recovery period, usually about six weeks. My chiropractor could get my spine back into alignment but the muscles had become too weak to hold it in position.", "I could see my future following the same path as that of a family friend who spent a large part of the last ten years of his life bedridden with back pain. Finally, after making a New Year\u2019s resolution, I was determined to do more to help myself. I started doing Pilates and, while that was helpful, the intensity of the exercises never seemed enough and I barely raised a sweat.

Sure, I had a couple of relapses in the first two years. After returning from holidays, my muscle strength had diminished enough for my spine to go out of alignment again. The difference was that instead of a six week recovery, I was back on my feet within a couple of days and doing Kieser again within two weeks.", "Now, muscle spasms are a distant memory and it\u2019s exceedingly easy for me to find the motivation to do two training sessions a week.

During this conversation he asked me if I had been to Kieser in Geelong, as they had machines that might assist me with my back and get me back to playing golf.

Why is this? When we cycle, our posture and pedaling action put an uneven load on the muscles. We primarily use the \u201cback, neck, shoulder, arm and chest muscles. It is essential, therefore, to strengthen these areas. If we don\u2019t, we will pay the price sooner or later,\u201d says Rothe, who is a passionate cyclist and regularly takes his mountain bike into the Alps.\u00a0", "Kieser remedies muscle imbalances. It builds up the strength of those muscles that miss out when you cycle. In addition, even the legs need a little extra help when it comes to muscle strength, explains Rothe: \u201cWhen you pedal, you extend or bend the leg \u2013 but not completely. On our machines, you train your flexors and extensors throughout their entire range of motion and thus, you correct muscle imbalances. This protects you from injury, such as knee problems.\u201d", "Strength training is also essential for maximising performance. Intensive training triggers the stimuli needed to improve the interplay between nerves and muscle fibres. As a result of these stimuli, unused fibres are mobilised and the cross-sectional area of individual muscle fibres is increased in size. This in turn increases strength. As Rothe explains, \u201ctraining the entire flexor and extensor muscle chains increases the power transmitted through the pedals, allowing you to ride at a faster pace, for example in a race.\u201d", "High levels of strength are also crucial for mountain biking. Rothe knows this from personal experience. Harsh terrain and rough mountain descents put a severe strain on the body. A strong muscle \u201ccorset\u201d provides protection and \u2013 along with a good technique \u2013 aids bike control and helps you negotiate obstacles. \u201cIn addition, anyone who has ridden downhill for several hundred metres knows that the limiting factor is not just a lack of technique. You also have to deal with the burning sensation in the thighs, forearms and wrists.

In fact, it's normal to lose up to three centimeters in height as you age. This loss occurs due to compression and moisture loss in our spinal discs. While shortening slightly is considered normal, a loss of four centimeters or more of height as well as the appearance of a hump may be evidence of osteoporosis, a potentially dangerous metabolic condition.", "Osteoporosis is a loss of bone density \u2013 which makes bones brittle and increases the risk of fracture.\u00a0This process tends to occur over a long period of time, so clients are usually unaware of the loss of bone mass and strength.

Unfortunately, osteoporosis most often occurs in elderly women, who usually do not go to a medical facility until it is too late.", "Some indications to help determine the risk of osteoporosis are a family history or frequent fractures in the family.\u00a0Fair-skinned and thinner women are\u00a0at a higher risk of developing osteoporosis. However, it can also occur as a result of other conditions, such as cases of clients with a history of hyperthyroidism, renal diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. In addition, some drugs, especially long-term use of cortisone, can cause the reduction of bone mass and thus increase the risk of fracture.", "Despite this evidence, some women simply have a genetic predisposition to osteoporosis in menopause. The loss of bone mass can be up to 4% per year, which can cause a loss of up to 20% of bone mass in five years. Thus, the natural strength of our body diminishes and suffering a fractured vertebral or peripheral bone is only a matter of time. Men are far less likely to be affected by osteoprosis, which makes it even more difficult to diagnose the condition early.", "Treatment for osteoporosis often requires the prescription of load bearing exercise. This may mean exercise such as walking or running but these exercises carry with them a risk of injury due to impact and repetition. Strength training is beneficial for osteoporosis as it applies a controlled force to the bones.

With the help of Kieser and some lifestyle changes, Jon is in the best shape he\u2019s been in for\u00a0years.\u00a0Here is his story:\u00a0", "\u201cI limped into Kieser in 2018. I\u2019d been living with hip mobility problems for about three years. After experiencing pain and discomfort all this time, my GP suggested she refer me to an Exercise Physiologist. She had heard good things about Kieser and after some research I decided to try it and landed at my local centre in Brighton. My Exercise Physiologist, Ben Milner, is a very warm and generous guy and made me feel I was in safe hands. We started very slowly as I had not participated in any serious exercise in more than a decade and my walking had become not much more than a shuffle. In the past, I had been very active until my forties and was a die-hard Les Mills Body Pump\u00a0participant. Running my own business and the rigours of middle-age took their toll and in a few years I was drinking and smoking heavily, mired in depression and heavily overweight.", "Eventually, I ended up in an ambulance on my way to the Epworth Cardiac Unit. That was a wake-up call for me and when I was discharged, I decided to get my act together. I gave up the cigarettes and the booze, which was very tough, weaned myself off anti-depressants and changed how I made a living. The down side was the new way had me \u2018on the tools\u2019 and on my feet all day. I was still struggling with my weight too; losing weight successfully, only to regain it through emotional eating and general laziness.\u00a0I had been going regularly to a health professional\u00a0who was able to give me some relief from the pain\u00a0with massage and dry-needling, but she assured me there was more going on than just work-related pain.", "I stand up most of the day leaning forward for hours on end as I do my work. She was sure it was damage to the tendons and that I should have scans and find out. After consulting my GP, the scans were carried out and as suspected, the tendons were torn and the labrum (cartilage lining of the socket) was damaged in both hip joints. Initially an orthopaedic surgeon sent me off for injections of Cortisone, and although it gave me blessed relief, it wore off after three weeks.", "All the while I was attending Kieser three days per week, making slow progress as Ben devised a program for me which would engage other muscle groups to take over the job of moving my body around while the damaged tendons were given a rest and time to heal themselves. I started calling it \u2018Keester\u2019 training, since primarily my gluteal muscles were the prime targets for improvement. My lower back, quads and abdominals all had to step in and take over so I could get moving again. Each time my program was reviewed, I was seen by a different Exercise Scientist. At first I thought it was odd, but later I realised that it\u2019s a great idea as then they all know you and are aware of your condition. That way they can guide you if you need it and make sure you are doing the exercises properly. It\u2019s a friendly atmosphere without being a social club and with no mirrors or music, it's clinical enough to maintain your focus and stay with your program.", "In addition to my Kieser program, Ben introduced me to the \u201cLife!\u201d program, hosted by Kieser which is a Victorian state government initiative with Diabetes Victoria. Basically it\u2019s a free program run to prevent people at risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke from developing those diseases. I am a prime candidate, since my father died of heart disease at 69 and my mother from a stroke at 71. Despite having given up smoking and drinking, I was still obese and at risk. The program encourages you to set goals and of course, mine was to lose weight. I told Ben I wanted to lose 20 kilos, but he suggested something more realistic, more achievable. So I tried to lose 5 kilos. All the participants were persuaded to lose 5% of their body weight which would greatly reduce our chances of heart attack, stroke and diabetes. While it was going on, I was sitting there listening, thinking, \u201cI know all this.\u201d \u201cEat smaller portions? Of course, that\u2019s so obvious!\u201d \u201cIncrease physical activity? Surely this is so simple; you don\u2019t need to be told.\u201d Then I had to ask myself, \u201cOkay, if it\u2019s so simple, why don\u2019t you do it?!\u201d", "Having come back from family Christmas break, I tipped the scales at 116 kilos. So January 2019, I decided to just do it. I kept up my Kieser program; I changed what I ate and how much of it I ate. I walked my dogs longer distances. I started having regular one-on-one sessions with Ben. He made me a home exercise program\u00a0to add to the one I was already doing. I lost the 5 kilos and just kept going. At the time of writing, I have lost over 40 kilos and now weigh just 75kgs. I haven\u2019t weighed so little since my Les Mills days. I have gone from wearing size 42\u201d trousers to size 32\u201d and I feel great for it.", "My hip pain is all but gone and I no longer take slow release anti-inflammatory tablets to make it through the day. No more pain-killers to sleep at night and my walking is now back to normal. Some people no longer recognise me, but that\u2019s ok. Some people who haven\u2019t seen me in many years claim I look the same as I did back then. Best of all is that I no longer need medication for high blood pressure or cholesterol. I recently told my GP that writing the referral to Kieser is the best thing she could have done for me.
