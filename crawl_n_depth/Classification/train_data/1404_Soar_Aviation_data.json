This has the\u00a0big advantage of\u00a0excellent directional control when the wheel is on the ground, particularly when it is windy. Some pilots prefer a castering nose wheel but on balance, Aeroprakt currently believes that direct steering through the pedals makes life a lot easier and safer.", "Control when you are taking off \u2013 all aircraft have a tendency to pull to the side when full power is applied for take-off, due to the combined gyro forces of the prop/engine and propwash over the tail. In the Foxbat, like all Rotax engined aircraft, there is a pull to the left on take-off. If the wind is also blowing from the left, these two will conspire to turn\u00a0you off the runway \u2013 something which can happen very quickly in the early stages of a take-off. Thankfully, the Foxbat has a huge rudder (and nose wheel steering!) to keep things in check right from the start of the take-off run.", "Control when you are flying \u2013 the big control surfaces give excellent control right down to stall speeds, while firming up at speed to make cruising more relaxed. Most modern aircraft, including the Foxbat,\u00a0stall very benignly. The nose drops gently and rarely does a wing drop.\u00a0The Foxbat is particularly gentle in the stall, even when the ball is a bit off-centre for two main reasons \u2013 the wing aero foil design and the slight forward sweep of the wings, which affects the centre of lift along the wing. However, be aware that not all aircraft are quite so forgiving!", "Control when you are landing \u2013 approach speeds vary a lot, with some light aircraft needing at least 65-70 knots down final to be safe. The faster the landing speed, the faster things happen if they go wrong and the more general wear and tear on the aircraft. Foxbat speeds with full flap should be around 50 knots down late finals and no more than 45 knots over the keys \u2013 maybe a few knots slower for one person and half fuel; maybe a few knots faster without flap. At these speeds, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to correct minor irregularities and the effects of the controls are not so sensitive, meaning there\u2019s less chance of over-controlling at this critical phase of flight.", "There are a couple of other control safety items. One: elevator authority in the landing flare. Some aircraft run out of elevator at landing speeds. But the massive elevator on the Foxbat gives great control right down to and even below landing speeds. Two: there\u2019s a big difference between flap limiting speed and stall speed without flap \u2013 in fact, well over 40 knots difference on the Foxbat. This is important because it gives the pilot plenty of time to lower the flap for landing and not worry about stalling.", "\u00a0", "Secondary safety", "Secondary safety ranges from the simple: how many bits stick out in the cabin to injure you? to the complex: how the airframe will protect you (or not) if you hit the ground too hard or end up inverted in a field.", "The Foxbat\u2019s primary airframe is made of metal \u2013 which is well known to have excellent impact absorbing qualities; initially it bends rather than breaks and the Foxbat\u2019s structure has been designed to reduce the G-forces acting during turbulence or a crash. Contrast that with many composite aircraft, which can shatter on impact into small, often sharp pieces, and wood, which also tends to break rather than bend on impact.", "The Foxbat cabin has a protective frame around it to minimise the chance of injury to the occupants. Unfortunately, over the years several Foxbats have been written off, but in Australia thankfully no-one has been seriously injured. A common reaction from people who\u2019ve experienced an accident in the Foxbat is: \u2018it all seemed so gentle, I just couldn\u2019t believe the aircraft was a write off when I got out and looked at it\u2019. That\u2019s because the airframe did its job. It\u2019s also important to note that in the rare instances where the aircraft has ended up inverted, the doors could still be easily opened to enable the occupants to exit quickly.", "Cabin ergonomics are an often overlooked aspect of design \u2013 not in the Foxbat! Specifically, whatever the control system choice, the Foxbat has been designed to be easy to enter and exit, particularly if you need to get out in a hurry \u2013 there\u2019s no stick to contort yourself around and the doors open wide. The cabin is wide and tall, so you\u2019re not jammed in with your co-pilot \u2013 the controls can be moved to their full extent without clashing elbows (or knees). The seats are set at the correct height, so you don\u2019t have to duck your head every time you need to look out (which should be a lot). Because, if reaching a control, adjusting an instrument or just looking outside the aircraft are a chore, these activities\u00a0will soon\u00a0be minimised and put in the \u2018can\u2019t be bothered\u2019 basket and as a result, your safety will be\u00a0compromised.", "Here are a few other safety thoughts on the Foxbat: a park brake facilitates engine warm-up and ignition checks; there\u2019s a battery isolator switch to cut off all power in the event you have to make an emergency landing; the side windows behind the pilot are positioned to give a good view around; the headset jacks are up and behind the occupants\u2019 heads and so do not present impact points for knees; the luggage container is zippered to stop stowed items flying around the cabin in turbulence (or worse); the controls do not sprout out of the fronts of the seats, leaving the floor clear and no danger of objects becoming trapped under the controls.", "These are just some of the safety aspects I looked at when deciding to become Australian Agent for the Foxbat. Over the years, I have become very critical of some of the shortcomings of other aircraft. But, while the Foxbat isn\u2019t perfect, I think the combination of easy ground handling, forgiving flight characteristics, cabin safety cage and room for pilots and passengers to operate the controls fully and unimpeded, is what, in my opinion, makes the Foxbat a safe aircraft to fly.", "\nSOAR ADVANCED FLIGHT TRAINING", "\nGOBEL AVIATION PTY.

Autokinetic illusion is similar to this; however, occurs at night or in poor visual conditions. This illusion gives pilots the impression that a stationary object is moving in front of the airplane\u2019s path and\u00a0occurs by staring at a fixed point of light, such as ground light or stars, in a dark background.", "Autokinetic illusion occurs when small eye movements in poor visual conditions, such as during night flying, are interpreted by the brain incorrectly, giving the impression of movement of the object being viewed.", "Somatogravic illusion", "These are a group of three various illusions caused by linear accelerations. The inversion illusion is caused when abrupt change from climb to straight-and-level flight stimulates the otolith organs in the body, creating an illusion of tumbling backwards. As a response to this illusion, pilots may push the aircraft into a nose-low altitude intensifying the illusion. ", "The head-up illusion involves a sudden forward linear acceleration during a level flight. In this situation, the pilot perceives that the nose of the aircraft is pitching up and as a result would push the yoke or the stick forward to pitch the nose of the aircraft down. During a night flight, from a well-lit airport into a dark sky the chance of the head-up illusion occurring is significantly increased, increasing the danger for a crash. ", "The head-down illusion is the opposite of the head-up illusion and occurs when a sudden linear deceleration occurs such as air braking or lowering of the flaps, during level flight. In this instance, pilots perceive the illusion that the nose of the aircraft is pitching down. Pilots will respond by pitching the nose of the aircraft up, causing the aircraft to stall if occurring during a low-speed final approach.
