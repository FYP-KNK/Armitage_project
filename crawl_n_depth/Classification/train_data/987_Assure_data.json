The e-counselling service is intended to provide brief support or direction and does not replace face-to-face counselling.The main school of thought is that face-to-face counselling remains the most effective format for provision of psychological interventions. Furthermore, face-to-face approaches are most widely researched and empirically validated, and thus Assure recommends all clients seek face-to-face services where possible. However, on-line counselling has been accepted by many to be a valid and important avenue for people to seek the support they need when they otherwise might shy away from such help.", "\n                ", "\n                    Request appointment\n                ", "\n            ", "\u00a9 2018 Assure Programs, part of the Ingeus Group of companies", "This content is password protected.

While these ideas may seem to be correct on the surface, they actually show a change in the way a person has come to think about him/herself. CHANGE \u2013 in thinking, feeling, acting \u2013 is a key feature in depression. Although the change may come on gradually, the depressed person is different from the way he was before the onset of the disorder. There are many examples of this change; the successful businessman who believes he is on the verge of bankruptcy, the devoted mother who wants to run away from her children, the gourmet chef/cook who can\u2019t stand food. Instead of seeking pleasure, the depressed person avoids it. Instead of caring for him/herself, appearance is neglected. The instinct to survive may give way to a desire to end life. The drive to succeed may be replaced by lack of energy and interest in life and withdrawal.", "The most obvious and typical sign of depression is sad mood, gloomy, lonely and apathetic. The depressed person may cry even when there is nothing to cry about, or may find it impossible to cry when a truly sad event occurs. He/she may have trouble sleeping or wake early in the morning unable to return to sleep; or may feel constantly tired and sleep more than usual and gain or lose weight.", "Typically, the depressed person also views him/herself in a very negative way, believing him/herself to be helpless and alone in the world and often blames him/herself for trivial faults and shortcomings. Such persons are pessimistic about themselves, about the world, and about the future. Interest in what is going on around them is lost, and they don\u2019t get satisfaction out of activities they used to enjoy. They often have trouble making decisions or getting themselves to carry out decisions they have made.", "Some people may be depressed without showing the usual sad, moody, dejected feeling. They may complain instead of physical discomfort or drink alcohol excessively or take drugs. When people seem tired and bored with what they are doing, they may actually be depressed. When bright students begin to do poorly at school, this may be compensating for an underlying depression.", "New Understanding From Research", "It is very common for depressed people to believe that they have lost something very important to them, often though this is not really the case. Depressed persons may believe they are losers, worthless and bad and perhaps not fit to live.", "Research into depression over a ten-year period attempted to examine the persistence of these unpleasant feelings in depressed people. It was found that an important factor is that depressed people interpret situations around them incorrectly. What they think is happening affects how they feel. That is, the depressed person feels sad and lonely because she/he incorrectly thinks she/he is abandoned and deserted.", "A depressed person can be helped by learning how to alter these errors in thinking, rather than concentrating on the depressed mood. Studies by Aaron Beck and others in the USA found that regardless of their low opinion of themselves, depressed persons perform just as well as normal subjects on a series of complex tasks. In one study depressed people were given a series of tests of increasing difficulty involving reading, comprehension and self-expression. As they began to experience stress, they became more optimistic. Their mood and self-image improved. They even performed better when they were later asked to try other tests.", "Thinking and Depression", "These and other similar findings suggested new approaches to treating depression and new ways for the depressed person to help him/herself. Hence, therapists are now concerned with the statements that people make to themselves, that is, what they think. It was found that depressed people have continuous, unpleasant thought and that with each negative thought the depressed feeling increases. Yet these thoughts are generally not based on real facts and make a person feel sad when there is no reason to feel that way. The negative thoughts may be to keep depressed people from engaging in activities that will make them feel better. As a result, they are likely to experience harsh, critical thoughts about being \u201clazy\u201d or \u201cirresponsible\u201d \u2013 which makes them feel worse and worse.", "In order to understand this faulty thinking, consider the following example; suppose you are walking down the street and you see a friend who appears to completely ignore you. Naturally you feel sad. You may wonder why your friend has turned against you. Later, when you mention the incident to your friend he tells you that he was so preoccupied at the time that he didn\u2019t even see you. Normally, you will feel better and put the incident out of your mind. If you are depressed however, you will probably believe that you friend has really rejected you. You may not even ask him about it, allowing the mistake to go uncorrected.", "Depressed people make such mistakes over and over again. In fact, they may misinterpret friendly overtures as rejections.

However, in the modern world we face fewer physical threats to our survival. In fact, most of the threats that we deal with on a day-to-day basis are psychological in nature. Our fight or flight mechanism is therefore activated by things such as: the perception of negative judgment or criticism from others; rejection; embarrassment; failure or loss of control. In these situations it is rarely appropriate to fight (e.g. push someone or be aggressive because they frowned while reading our report) or flight (e.g. run out of the office because someone is frowning). As a result of the body\u2019s physical response we are left with uncomfortable physical sensations (e.g. dizziness; heart palpitations; hyperventilation). For some people these are so uncomfortable or scary that they end up finding ways to avoid being in situations that might lead to these feelings (e.g. call in sick on the day a manager is due to review a project).", "For those of us who are vulnerable to anxiety, continued avoidance can lead to an exaggeration of the perception, or thoughts that the threat is real. This means that you may start to expect that the worst will happen e.g. you might believe that if your boss doesn\u2019t like your project you will be fired. In these situations, the fight or flight response can become too sensitive, like a car alarm that is triggered by the slightest brush against the car.
