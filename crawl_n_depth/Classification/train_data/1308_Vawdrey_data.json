We customise our equipment to best suit our customers\u2019 needs, and Vawdrey is always very accommodating.", "\u201cWhen we have an idea for a trailer, we sit down together with Vawdrey to try and come up with the most innovative solution, thinking outside of the square to see how we can add value to our customers. My senior leadership team also has input into our trailer designs, so we can discuss what works for our needs and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d", "The new 42-metre AB-triple is yet another Vawdrey PBS design initiative.

The continuous development of the Iceliner freezer van has seen Vawdrey Australia expand its presence in the heavy-duty refrigerated markets in Northern Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. Iceliner freezer vans, according to Paul Vawdrey, emphasise efficiency, reliability and productivity. \u201cWith quality insulation and solid trailer design, the Iceliner can hold cargo temperatures extremely low, which is ideal for fleet operators moving perishable commodities across great distances,\u201d he says.", "One way that trailer builder can optimise the Iceliner for productivity under Australia\u2019s Performance-Based Standards (PBS) high productivity scheme is to overhaul its axle configuration.", "\u201cBy implementing a quad-axle system, for instance, superior weight distribution enables vehicle operators to load trailers with higher allowable weight, which could maximise payload potential,\u201d Paul Vawdrey says \u2013 explaining that the advent of the PBS scheme has given many transport companies the opportunity to achieve higher productivity and increased safety by using specially designed, oversized equipment. \u201cVawdrey Australia has embraced technological innovation, gradually implementing PBS across our entire product portfolio to suit various applications.\u201d", "Since 2012, Vawdrey Australia has played a major role in enabling the PBS scheme to expand beyond the classic truck and dog segment and brought it to the general and refrigerated freight market, effectively helping Australia\u2019s road transport community cement its reputation as the most progressive in the world.", "Vawdrey\u2019s PBS journey began with the design of a Super B-double capable of hauling two 40\u2019 containers at once, operating under strict PBS guidelines set out by the state of Victoria\u2019s traffic and road authority. Less than a year later, it rolled out a whole range of Super B-double combinations based on the same concept, marking a major milestone in increased access for Higher Productivity Freight Vehicles (HPFV) under the new Victorian Freight & Logistics Plan introduced by the Victorian Coalition Government in August 2013.", "More recently, this year, Toll Group specified the Super B-double combination from Vawdrey Australia. It is, according to the transport and logistics company, the largest road transport vehicle currently in use in Singapore.", "\u201cThe super B-double is an amazing 2\u00d740-footer trailer that has enabled us to increase productivity and provides inter-gateway haulage services between three terminals \u2013 Pasir Panjang, Keppel and Brani,\u201d a Toll spokesperson says.", "Paul Vawdrey says the Super B-doubles in Australia are typically fitted with Electronic Braking Systems (EBS), side underrun protection and a quad-quad suspension system to satisfy route access and Performance-Based Standards (PBS) requirements. \u201cThe super B-double design cuts travel time, vehicle usage and fuel consumption while enabling bigger payloads,\u201d he says.", "In a joint report between Australia\u2019s National Heavy Vehicle Regulator (NHVR) and ARTSA, one in five new heavy vehicles are PBS approved. In the last five years, the total of new PBS combination approvals have doubled, while the heavy vehicle market has only grown by about 20 per cent over the same period. Interestingly, more than 55 per cent of PBS approvals are for truck and dog combinations.

Vawdrey Australia manufactures dry freight van and refrigerated Wingliner models in rigid, semi-trailer and B-double configurations.\u201d", "The Wingliner is also ideal for transport operators looking to increase their bottom line, according to Paul Vawdrey. \u201cThis innovative trailer design allows even more productivity on each and every trip without sacrificing safety,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is ideal for progressive companies looking at implementing the latest in trailer design.", "The original Wingliner concept was developed by Austrian company Wingliner International in 1996. Excited by the concept on-show in Hanover, Germany, at the time, Vawdrey Australia teamed up with Wingliner International to develop a Wingliner product for Australia\u2019s roads. The developments have continued, and the Wingliner is still considered to be a novel, futuristic concept.", "Taking load restraint to the next level, Vawdrey has its Buckle-less curtain system that combines safety and efficiency.", "\u201cPeople want a load restraint system that is safe, reliable, and works time and time again,\u201d Vawdrey says. \u201cThe Buckle-less curtain is a system that has no buckles, no gates, and no gimmicks, which is exactly what the market is after. The load-rated curtain\u2019s strength comes from carbon fibre straps that are connected to the roof of the trailer using a pivoting double roller system. A specially designed lower hook and tensioning system provides the tension required and flawless load restraint. The curtain is tensioned vertically via a complex position ratchet system.\u201d", "In addition to its Iceliner and Wingliner trailer builds, Vawdrey Australia provides a comprehensive product range including robust skeletal trailers that are designed for durability and ease-of-use, Titeliner models from rigid, dog and pig trailers through to semi-trailer configurations and various dry freight vans to cover any client requirement.", "To bolster such a diverse trailer portfolio, Vawdrey also adds value with innovative technologies like the Auto Lock Deck System, which optimises deck handling safety and efficiency.", "The Auto Lock Deck system promotes a safer workplace environment through innovative design.", "According to Vawdrey, the Auto Lock Deck is a boon for the commercial road transport in terms of performance gains.", "\u201cThe Auto Lock Deck is simple to operate and can save up to 10 minutes for every deck movement,\u201d he says. \u201cTo lower the deck, the operator simply selects the unlock function, lifts the deck to disengage the locks and then lowers the deck to the desired position. It ratchets through each of the locking positions on the mezzanine deck posts when lifting to provide a fast and simple method of lifting the deck by forklift.\u201d", "The Vawdrey Auto Lock Deck also negates the need for vehicle operators to work beneath a deck or to remove the deck from the vehicle to adjust the deck height, which significantly improves Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) practices.", "Ultimately, Vawdrey trailers are tailored to accommodate the needs of the industry and emphasise safety and efficiency.", "\u201cWe have built a reputation on our ability to custom build products to meet the exacting needs of our customers,\u201d Vawdrey says \u2013 adding that his team is always looking to achieve greater efficiency gains through PBS implementation. \u201cOur national presence continues to grow as we look after our local and international clientele.

To access many of our customer sites, we need to split up the B-double sets, which results in about 45 minutes of downtime to unhook and then hook the trailers back up. With the PBS-approved trailer, we are getting additional pallet space without the restrictions of a B-double.

As Hawk Logistics charges using a space rate and carries pallets that are of regular dimensions, this combined with the extra weight has resulted in further cost savings. \u201cBeing able to carry extra weight and extra pallets is extra money for the business. We are still using the same amount of fuel and there is no extra workload for the driver. It\u2019s just more efficient,\u201d Amrit explains. \u201cWith refrigerated transport, I personally believe that a B-double is hard work, because you\u2019re having to use a much larger combination, which is why we\u2019ve gone with this PBS-approved option instead.\u201d", "The new Vawdrey Iceliner features a quad axle group with a forward self-steer axle for optimised weight distribution. According to Vawdrey, this results in better utilisation of the trailer as a freezer as it ensures even pallet weights are maintained throughout the whole trailer. By fitting a lift axle to the steer axle, the trailer can operate on the Level 1 General Access network when the axle is raised. The functionality of the self steer and lift axle is controlled through the WABCO Electronic Braking System.", "As the quad axle Vawdrey Iceliner freezer van is the first PBS-approved trailer to enter the fleet, Hawk Logistics valued the level of support and assistance provided by Vawdrey throughout the approval process. \u201cVawdrey not only helped to determine what solution we needed, they also stepped us through the design process and worked through the approval process, which was a big win for us, because the Vawdrey team was able to take care of all of that themselves.

The beauty of such a structure is that the company only pays for what it uses, without carrying the overhead. This strategy will ensure it can grow at a controlled rate,\u201d says Damien. \u201cIn fact, the formation of this new business is the strategy that we have employed to continue the growth of the group. Customers can expect the same high level of service, support and innovation from F1 as they have and continue to get from GTS.\u201d", "F1 will offer road linehaul transport focusing on high-utilisation routes and contracts.

Bulk movement is the goal we want to achieve, and that\u2019s what VicRoads are trying to work towards with the HPFV program.\u201d", "According to John, however, complying with those regulations was not the only issue Qube Logistics had to address when it decided on the super-sized Vawdrey design. \u201cWe had several issues we needed to iron out from our previous trailers. Those niggling factors included air operating valves for the height regulation,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen the trailers were loaded, they weren\u2019t pumping the air quick enough, so containers would load on and the drivers would leave before the valves had completed the lift. This could ultimately wear out our components, so we needed to purchase high speed air valves just to be able to get that air in more efficiently.\u201d", "Now, armed with 10 more of Vawdrey\u2019s Super B\u2019s, John acknowledges that Qube Logistics may have found the right trailer to optimise what he calls \u2018impact loading\u2019 \u2013 allowing the company to cart more freight using fewer vehicles, thereby lessening congestions. \u201cWhat makes Vawdrey trailers so efficient is the design\u2019s core strength. In the container industry, we measure a trailer upon its ability to endure what we call impact loading,\u201d he points out. \u201cWhen you have a standard B-double, you load goods pallet by pallet which gradually increases weight with each loaded pallet. But in a waterfront situation, a straddle comes along with a 30-tonne container and the load goes straight onto the trailer in one hit. So the trailer must have enough strength to sustain that type of impact loading.\u201d", "John adds, \u201cIt is the same scenario on the return trip, for instance when the trailers are offloading, the forklifts or straddles will lift the container off and all of a sudden that 30 tonne weight disappears. That weight fluctuation puts a lot of stress on your airbags and suspension, so the trailer needs to be robust in that regard. We now feel that these 40\u2019/40\u2019 super B-doubles allow us to cut travel time, vehicle usage and fuel consumption, while increasing our payload.

The distribution floor has been chosen to increase driver grip when walking inside. A foldaway ladder also improves access in and out of the trailer.", "From a performance perspective, Paul also notes that his drivers have been impressed with the improved maneuverability of the trailers due to the new design. \u201cThe major advantage with these Vawdrey trailers compared to some of our other equipment is when our drivers reverse into a smaller loading dock to unload, the trailer is easier to steer and can be positioned perfectly. This not only saves the trailer from getting damaged, but the surrounding area too.\u201d", "Having achieved the goal of putting five \u2018safety-first\u2019 trailers into service, Paul sees a bright future ahead for the GBR-Vawdrey partnership, especially since the latter is willing to go the extra mile to produce a flawless, risk-free design. \u201cFrom the moment Vawdrey went into production, we were kept up-to-date on the manufacturing progress,\u201d Paul says. \u201cIn fact, Vawdrey would invite us to visit their workshop on a weekly basis to see the process.

These are the first trailers to wear this new safety message, but people can expect to see a lot more of it in coming months,\u201d explains Terry Bickerton, National Manager of Fleet for the Australia Post Group. Vawdrey has built more than half of the national Australia Post trailer fleet, and is the manufacturer of choice when it comes to tautliners. It\u2019s a business partnership that has stood the test of time, extending for more than 30 years. \u201cVawdrey understands our business and Australia Post understands theirs, in terms of what we can achieve from a productivity perspective and from a timeframe perspective,\u201d adds Terry. \u201cSafety is our number one core value and we don\u2019t compromise on it. That\u2019s part of the reason we only purchase equipment from major manufacturers. We choose our suppliers based around the safety features they can incorporate into our equipment, the large volumes they are capable of producing and their ability to satisfy all of our requirements. \u201cVawdrey is quite a progressive company from a safety and an innovation perspective. They are always pushing the boundaries in terms of what can be done. They are a very progressive business with regards to producing higher productivity and PBS trailers. With more and more online orders, our freight task continues to grow, so we are moving very large volumes of product.\u201d Thanks to PBS, Australia Post has been introducing a growing number of higher productivity vehicles into the fleet. \u201cThis sort of innovation means we can move more freight with less vehicles, helping to get more vehicles off the road. We work within the limits of what the current legislation allows, but we need manufacturers that can support and work within those areas as well, and Vawdrey does just that,\u201d adds Terry. Australia Post\u2019s commitment to safety has never waivered, with the business constantly taking advantage of developing safety technologies to ensure its fleet is as safe as can be. In 2012 for example, Australia Post began implementing anti-lock brakes and stability control across the fleet. \u201cWe use Volvo prime movers which we consider to be the safest on the market. The prime movers have anti lock brakes and stability control, so it makes sense to pair that with a trailer that has the same capabilities,\u201d says Terry. As well as ensuring its fleet is built to the highest safety standards, reliability is paramount too. \u201cAnd that\u2019s part of the reason we use the manufacturers we use. We choose suppliers that we believe are the best in their category,\u201d Terry adds. \u201cAustralia Post has a great partnership with Vawdrey. They are very accessible and understand our requirements. If I need trailers produced in a hurry, they always try and accommodate that wherever possible. The longevity of the Vawdrey product is also testament to the build quality. We do very little work to the trailers apart from regular maintenance. And on the flip side, when a trailer comes to the end of its life in our fleet, a Vawdrey trailer maintains great resale value too.\u201d", "MAIN OFFICE", "1-53 Quantum Close ", "Dandenong South, 3175 ", "Phone: +61 3 9797 3700", "Fax: +61 3 9702 8598 ", "Vawdrey Finance: 0414 210 633", "Transport giant ", "Qube Logistics", " purchased its first ", "Vawdrey", " trailer in 2002, laying the foundation for a decade of growth and prosperity.
