As mentioned previously, bones do not form and stay there forever, they are dynamic in nature and respond very well to external loads. Gravity is an external load our body is very much used to when standing upright (body weight).

This can be achieved through: ", "Walking", "Running/ Sprinting", "Jumping/ Power exercises", "Strength/ Resistance training ", "Additional to promoting bone growth, these exercises also help strengthen the surrounding muscles of the bones, assisting us with stronger and quicker movements that can help prevent us from injuries and falls. Falls prevention is very important for osteoporotic bones, as they are too brittle and weak to withstand the impact of a fall, greatly increasing the risk of fracture. When we lose our balance, and begin to fall, we recruit certain strategies to help protect us from (serious) injury. If our legs are strong enough, coupled with good balance then we can quickly adjust our centre of gravity to remain upright.

The cause of patellofemoral pain is multifactorial, whereby altered alignment of the hip, knee and ankle joints causes excessive stress on the knee joint, leading to and pain surrounding the knee cap (patella). This pain is present during activities such as running, squatting and ascending and descending stairs.\u00a0 ", "As the contributing factors leading to patellofemoral pain are varied, a tailored exercise program involving specific stretching, releasing and strengthening to improve the altered alignment of the hip, knee and ankle joints should be prescribed. Excessive loading of the knee joint during exercise and daily activities should be avoided in order to prevent the exacerbation of knee pain and discomfort .", "Iliotibial Band Syndrome", "Iliotibial band syndrome is a common cause of knee pain, seen mostly in endurance athletes and runners. With repeated bending and straightening of the knee joint, the iliotibial band becomes irritated and inflamed, causing pain on the outside of the knee.", "High running /walking volumes and muscle imbalance through the hips, knees and ankle joints are the main contributors leading to the irritation of the iliotibial band. Treatment should involve activity modification, reduction in running volume, and prescription of a specific stretching and strengthening exercise program with a focus towards improving the strength of the gluteals. As the iliotibial band is inflamed through repeated knee bending and straightening, exercises involving these motions should be limited to avoid recurrence of pain. ", "Meniscus Tears/Repairs", "The meniscus are tough cartilage located in the knee joint between the shin and thigh bone, responsible for distributing load and shock absorption through the lower limb.\u00a0 As the thigh bone pivots on the shin bone, it can trap the meniscus, leading to tears. If symptoms are present during daily activities, the meniscal tear may need to be repaired through keyhole surgery. ", "A rehabilitation program for meniscal tears and repairs should focus on restoring range of motion and strengthening the quadriceps, particularly the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO; the key stabilising quadricep muscle). As pain is exacerbated by the forces of extreme knee bending and rotation, these motions should be avoided in your exercise program and in daily activities.\u00a0 ", "\u00a0", "Anterior Cruciate Ligament reconstructions ", "The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) prevents the thigh bone from moving forwards on the shin bone and rotation of the knee. It is commonly injured during knee hyperextension, rotation, deceleration, landing and high force contact at the knee joint. The decision the treat an ACL tear with surgery will depend on various factors, however it is common for a completely torn ACL to be surgically repaired.\u00a0 ", "As there are a number of successful ACL rehabilitation protocols (for example; accelerated and gradual), your surgeon and treating exercise physiologist or allied health professional will provide direction on the most appropriate. Where reconstruction surgery has taken place, the rehabilitation program will depend on the type of graft used, type of surgery completed, the surgeon\u2019s preferences and any other injuries which may influence the exercise program. The intensity and loading of range of motion, strengthening and functional exercises will be tailored with consideration to the tissue healing timeline in order to ensure safety and maximise outcomes. ", "\u00a0", "Total Knee Replacement ", "Total knee replacements are a successful surgical procedure to improve quality of life for those suffering severe osteoarthritis. After total knee replacements, exercise is prescribed to reduce pain and swelling, improve range of motion, strength, walking tolerance and allow a return to pre-surgery functional capacity. ", "\u00a0After surgery, stretching and mobility will commence to regain loss of motion in conjunction with muscle strengthening for the quadriceps. Education will be provided regarding techniques for positional changes such as lying to sitting, sitting to standing and standing to walking to ensure safety during these activities.", "Individuals should also comply with using gait aids when prescribed (eg. 4 wheel walker and frames) and follow guidelines on their weight bearing capacity during rehabilitation. ", "\u00a0", "Osteoarthritis", "Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and is characterised by progressive degeneration of the cartilage, narrowing of the joint space and surrounding muscle weakness. Osteoarthritis is frequently diagnosed in the knee joints and contributes to pain and impaired daily function. ", "Regular exercise, specifically aerobic conditioning, stretching and strengthening exercises which target the stabilising muscles of the knee and hip have been shown to improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Water based exercise has also been shown to reduced pain and discomfort and improve function. It is recommended that individuals with knee osteoarthritis avoid high impact and repetitive force type exercises such as running and jumping as the elevated joint load may cause joint swelling and pain. ", "Exercise prescription ", "Self-myofascial release (spikey ball and foam rolling), and stretching/mobility exercise for the hip, knee and ankle can assist the restoration of range of motion, reduce muscular tension and improve patella (knee cap) alignment which may be a contributing factor to knee pain. The gluteals, iliotibial hand, tensor fascia late, quadriceps, hamstrings and calves are commonly targeted muscles for stretching, myofascial release and mobility exercises when addressing knee pain. ", "Strengthening of the quadriceps muscle group, primarily the VMO, will assist in stabilising the patella and improve its ability to maintain proper alignment during activity. Gluteal and core strength is also an integral part of any lower limb exercise program given their impact on knee alignment and pelvic stability in functional tasks such as walking. Improving the strength of remaining lower limb muscles (eg. hamstrings, calves, foot muscles) will also produce positive effects for knee pain through providing support to the knee in daily activities. Balance and proprioception exercises will be added to ensure safety in return to activity, improve muscular control and reduce risk of falls. Depending on client history and goals, plyometric and activity/sport specific exercises will commence following the strengthening phase of rehabilitation. ", "\u00a0It is important to remember that differing types of exercises (eg. closed vs open chain, isometric vs isotonic muscle contractions, eccentric vs concentric contractions) provide different stress to the knee joint and thus should be prescribed according to the pathology and its evidence based rehabilitation protocols. An exercise physiologist is a tertiary qualified health professional who delivers evidence based exercise prescription to assist the management of acute or chronic medical conditions, injuries or disabilities. Following an initial assessment, your exercise physiologist will prescribe, monitor and progress your tailored exercise program according to your specific condition, capabilities and goals in order to achieve optimal outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0 ", "For more information please contact PACE Health Management and speak to one of our team members.\u00a0", "Ph: 9770 6770 ", "References\u00a0", "Houglum, P.

Is there any real benefit to be gained? Will it stunt their growth or increase their risk of injury?", "A common concern people have with resistance training for youth\u2019s is the risk of injury and stunting growth. It is a common myth that children shouldn\u2019t start lifting weights until they are fully matured as it stunts their growth due to damaging the growth (epiphyseal) plates, which are responsible for creating growth of the long bones. These growth plates are highly resistant to shearing forces, which are the kind of forces put through the bones during activity. Research has identified that injury rates in youths performing resistance training are lower than injury rates in competitive sports. When we look at injury rates in competitive sports, it is also documented that injury rates are lower in the youths who complete resistance training, compared to their non-trained counterparts. That is to say, adolescents completing resistance-based training are less likely to be injured in the gym than in sport, and less likely to be injured in their chosen sport if they regularly complete resistance training at the gym.", "So why are these injury rates reduced?", "When resistance training is performed correctly, including proper technique and coaching, appropriate exercise selection, suitable load and repetitions, rest periods and tempo (speed of movement), it will create specific adaptations to the athlete\u2019s body and more importantly neural system. The main improvement we aim to achieve in coaching youths is improved development of motor control/ patterns. By improving how they move, we can achieve greater strength, speed and power, which can be translated to the sporting realm. This improved movement pattern also means the young athlete is better at jumping, landing, running, etc in a safe and effective manner. That is to say they more effectively disperse the load between working muscles, opposed to over working muscles, or incorrectly loading joints. Appropriately designed and well-supervised resistance training programs actively prevent injury by increasing the strength of supportive tissues (muscles, tendons, ligaments) as well as improving movement patterns such as running, jumping and landing.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks\u201d, an age-old adage that couldn\u2019t hold more truth.

This lack of dopamine means people can have difficulty controlling their movements and moving freely, causing the above mentioned stereotypical symptoms. It can also impact on other body systems such as sense of smell, thinking and mood. As a neurodegenerative disease it progressively worsens over time with increasing severity in symptoms.", "How is it caused?", "There is currently no understanding as to why an individual develops Parkinson\u2019s disease.

Particular emphasis should be placed on the extensor muscles \u00a0of \u00a0the trunk and hip to prevent incorrect posture. Dual tasking and cueing have an important role to play in the exercise rehabilitation process.", "\u00a0", "Dual tasking", "Dual tasking exercises are tasks that require multiple complex movements and/or cognitive tasks to be performed at once. The significance of this with regards to Parkinson\u2019s disease is that gait and motor control slows down as the disease progresses, this becomes amplified when multiple tasks are performed together e.g. walking down the street whilst talking to someone on the phone. Multiple studies have shown that individuals who participate in dual tasking exercises improve their gait speed, stride time and length, cadence and step length.", "Cueing", "When exercising, providing cues either verbally, visually or tactilely helps the initiation and ongoing facilitation of movement. An example of a method to improve walking ability is auditory rhythmic cueing using a metronome: subjects are asked to synchronise their steps to the rhythm of a sound beat.

The onset of AS ranges from early 20s to 45 years of age and has a detrimental lifetime impact on the individual (Brown, 2009). \u00a0AS is a form of chronic systemic inflammatory disease that mainly affects the axial skeleton. Individuals that are diagnosed with AS report, pain,\u00a0 stiffness and a significantly reduced mobility of affected joint(s)\u00a0(Millner et al., 2016). These changes in axial mobility impair postural control, creates a kyphotic posture, increases the patients risk of falling, reduces pulmonary function, and increases their risk of CVD (Berdal, Halvorsen, van der Heijde, Mowe, & Dagfinrud, 2012; Millner et al., 2016; Vergara, O\u2019Shea, Inman, & Gage, 2012).", "The studies", "Multiple studies (Gyurcsik, 2012; Millner et al., 2016; Vergara et al., 2012 Atlan ,2011)\u00a0concluded that standing postural control is significantly altered in those diagnosed with AS and \u00a0trunk stability and core muscle recruitment is impaired. \u00a0Further research conducted by Mathieu, Gossec, Dougados, & Soubrier (2011)\u00a0and Masiero et al., (2011)\u00a0reported those with AS who engaged in 20-minutes of light aerobic exercise (walking, swimming and cycling) in conjunction with daily spinal mobility exercises have a reduced pain and improved function. \u00a0\u00a0It is suggested that a supervised exercise program is undertaken \u00a0two-times per week for three-months, which consists of postural education, spinal mobility exercise and stretches can decrease pain intensity and spine stiffness for AS sufferers \u00a0(Gyurcsik et al., 2012).", "Exercise Physiology and AS", "Exercise has been proven (and well known) to play an important part in the management of AS in conjunction with appropriate anti-inflammatory medication.\u00a0 Exercise physiology is essential in facilitating and empowering patients diagnosed with AS to provide education, improving mobility, fitness and functional posture.
