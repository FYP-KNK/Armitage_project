If a 3D printed product, for example, is to be built from nothing, then layers of plastic are extruded and built on top of each other. Unfortunately, this would only form a weak structure made from hundreds of thin laminations.

The technique enables an engineer to quickly turn a virtually rendered component into a physical part, one that can be function-tested to see if it matches client specifications. Interestingly, advanced formulations are now sending the components into the end-use node of the process, which means 3D printed parts are now durable enough to fit tough application domains. The FDM machinery also works within tight constraints, the kind of high-tolerance values that result in geometrically accurate profiles. In short, the thermoplastic construct is an accurate rendering of the computer-modelled product.", "The FDM polymer is selected according to its base chemical properties and how those properties work in tandem during the layering stage.

This is the first of many factors, features that are expected in every one of these vital grooved wheels.", "A wide-spectrum usage domain rules pulleys and the threaded mediums that roll through their grooves. The material is expected to rotate at speed, as mentioned above, which will incur some amount of loss in the form of heat. Yes, the bearings cope with generated and radiated thermal events, but the job of an engineer is to provide performance overhead. Additionally, vibrational losses often defeat rolling bearings, which means a good temperature-resistance factor is, again, highly desirable. Smoothly moulded plastics, tough graded nylons and durable urethanes offset temperature, handling the excess heat. Remember, even when loads aren\u2019t heavy, smaller wheel pulleys are out there, and they\u2019re packed with spools of abrasive materials, hard plastic filaments and ropes that also add friction to the mix.", "Heat resistance stops friction burn. Simultaneously, a strong chemical resistance feature stops applied lubricating oils from weakening the physical structure of the pulleys. But, hold on a second, this is turning into a one-sided study. What about the locking mechanisms and pinions that form the mechanical core of these rotating plastic components? Wheel pulleys are manufactured with all of these components built into the final design. Snap-release variants partner with metal frames and curving pulley guards, but all-in-one designs also integrate these parts to deliver a ready-to-market design, one that includes the braking mechanism and all centralised physical parts. Or, should it be mandated by the client, the parts can be fabricated as ready to install on a separate machine, perhaps a conveyor belt for a large mining complex, a scenario that demands dozens of identically manufactured components.", "Among the more important properties, durability and robust functionality, the grooved wheels are fabricated from polymers that won\u2019t compress.

After all, acrylic is every bit as clear as glass, but it\u2019s not nearly as stress-intolerant. The thermoplastic can bend and be shaped into usable products, for instance. That versatile form first came about in the mid-twentieth century, with polymerization technology throwing two chemical compounds together to give birth to this celebrated translucent product.

This could be as simple as changing the chemical composition of the polymer ever so slightly to match the material specifications set in stone by the client or as complex as a short loop modification model, a cycling loop where the component\u2019s base design is continually amended and taken through several revisions until the custom mould matches the client\u2019s design criteria. ", "The initial design, not surprisingly, may never function as the original concept intended, which is purely down to the fact that concepts need fine tuning before theory can become a functioning application. Next, the tailor-made products avoid the homogeneous problems that come from mass production work. In short, these generic items do function as designed, spawning again and again from faceless moulds, but they don\u2019t perform with the stellar efficiency seen in customised products. The tailored alternative is precisely commissioned to meet exhaustively set dimensional standards and experimentally determined material specifications. The result of these laborious endeavours is a product that exhibits every material characteristic and every dimensional target as determined by the original prototype and all of its subsequent revisions.", "The high volume fabrication of customised plastic and rubber mouldings is an extremely specialized service, one that should be appraised and quantified before moving ahead in a project. Select an enterprising engineering plastics partner that promotes such diversified work, a professional solution that offers affordable customization services. Make the most of the design, and align with a fabrication team that will treat the part to something that goes far beyond basic uniformity to deliver the component in its premium form, an exactingly measured profile that mirrors the designer\u2019s original concept so that the product can enter high volume production while retaining its customised roots.", "Strezlecki Grove, Laverton VIC 3028", "43 Triholm Avenue, Laverton VIC 3028", "Phone: ", "03 9369 2577", "Fax: ", "03 9369 7117", "Email: ", "enquiries@engplastics.com.au", "A mining complex is a terrible place to install man-made tools and equipment. Abrasive rocks cut at rigid metal panels. Water pours down every rough wall, and humidity kills electrical circuitry. Rubber products for the mining industry arbitrate this geological horror show, reducing the damage by introducing a versatile mechanical constituent to the gritty mix. Rough-hewn rocks loaded with trace elements and precious minerals pummel the alloys protecting the equipment, but polymer-imbued pliability comes to the rescue, delivering a protective layer, one that ejects shock events with a solid bounce and an anti-abrasive skid to instantly reform and deal with the next glancing blow.", "A resilient molding forms rubber wedges, chocks that allow the passage of utility cables and smooth the way of vehicle wheels. Rubber-lined sheets coat hoppers, imbuing light-duty self-tipping feeders and heavy-duty bins with a shock-attenuating layer. This coating acts as a defensive lining, one that protects warp-prone metal housings from the crushing force of mined raw material. Also employed for other material handling duties, foot traffic mats, and transfer chute lining.", "The conveyor belt and screening decks are obvious examples of rubber products for the mining industry, so no prizes for guessing those. But take a peek under the steel-reinforced belt. The roller pulleys and the drum cladding on the pulleys use high-grip rubber to stop energy-sapping slippage events and maximize the operation of the drive system, including any of the vibratory action that screens thin streams of aggregate matter. Indeed, rubberized inserts counterbalance the springs and assembly elements of this counter-vibrating mechanism, thus canceling wear and enhancing the screening cycle.", "This turnkey service produces products that precisely fit a stated application. Sound-absorbing rubber screens and perimeter bumpers increase wear-resistance by a factor of 15 when compared with equivalent fabrics and wire meshes, which ensures the transportation segment of the mine keeps moving around the clock. Down among the chutes, special inflatable linings further reduce impact and establish a favourable flow of material that attenuates wastage, a move that\u2019s especially applicable when the conveyed material is a valuable mineral such as a stream of diamond-laden gravel.", "On moving away from the main artery of the operation, rubber products for the mining industry form water hoses and pump drive belts, \u2018O\u2019 rings for drainage pipes and grip handles for heavy tools.

Firstly, the initial benefits mentioned above are also viewed as drawbacks by designers and engineers. In short, the tough plastic is as daunting as any alloy. It takes high-end tooling and superb processing proficiency to work with UHMW polyethylene. This statement applies to extrusion stages, moulding techniques, and other processing work. Advanced thermal treatments need to be applied here, high temperatures that reach the 131\u00b0C crystalline melting point of the tough plastic and use this fiery heat to alter the viscous properties of the material, thus making the extruded slugs more workable.", "Mechanical strength jumps to the top of the list, but there are numerous other benefits, material advantages that make the hard work more than cost-effective. Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene is self-lubricating and formulated with bacterial growth cancelling properties. It\u2019s also a champion when used in hot environments, can function in super-cold environs, and is imbued with a low friction coefficient that partners superbly with an impressively accomplished chemically-resistant structure.", "As all of these attributes are ruled by atomic density, the grading of the material can be adjusted to target the polymer at many contrasting applications. Snowmobile tracks and skis made from UHMW coast over snow and gritty rock without wearing or cracking.

In an age where vehicles rely on fuel sources, these two synthetic elastomers rule. Of course, don\u2019t discount the plumbing gasket, the cold and hot water conveying component seals that runs throughout every structure.

For example, water bottles are made from PET, a versatile fossil-fuel product known as polyethylene terephthalate. Environmental lobbyists argue that while the plastic is safe and incredibly useful, easy to recycle into a PET resin for new applications, the recycle rate for the bottles lays around the thirty percent mark. That\u2019s nowhere near enough considering the billions of plastic bottles being used every day. ", "Beyond green concerns, the need to keep the planet pollution-free, industry cannot support this level of petroleum wastage, not when the cost of fuel is rocketing and industry experts are scrambling for alternatives to crude oil. One solution, a direction receiving investment in 2015, is to direct our resources into bioplastics. This class of plastic was first uncovered when chemists learned that petroleum wasn\u2019t the only polymer source on the planet. Natural polymers abound in nature if we know where to look for them. Soy protein is a natural polymer. Cellulose is a natural polymer. Look toward soy products and we see plastics arising with properties that meet or even exceed their fossil-fuel counterparts. The molecules are even arranged intelligently to achieve biodegradable breakdown thanks to catalytic action with natural micro-organisms that devolve the plastic into a recyclable soup.", "Mainstream manufacturers of high-end plastics are now assigning up to twenty percent of their sourcing to acre-after-acre of corn fields and reservoirs of soy protein. 2015 suggests that coming trends will back up the momentum of this bioplastic surge by presenting new options for current issues. For example, aeronautics requires a lightweight but tough construction for the various assemblies that tie together in an aircraft or satellite. Carbon fibre is one solution, but the material remains expensive. Reinforcement through the production of fibrous bioplastics made from hemp and flax is a more affordable and now more realistic option.

Recently, it\u2019s long fibre-reinforced composites that are winning their place in the structural tug-of-war between the two freight commodity plastics. Both thermoplastic variants offer lightweight carriage, a ride that promotes durable transport without impact damage. They also reject aging. Wood will rot and paper lacks tensile strength, but these plastics never age.", "At some point we need to quantify where the long-fiber variant trumps its shorter cousin. Just as with any other superior engineering plastic, the advantages come from versatility and the ability to tailor the long form for a specific purpose. Factors that decide the tailoring properties include the orientation of the fibre in relation to the stored package, the particular thermoplastic used in the construction of the fibres, and the diameter of the actual fibres. Additional factors may include hybrid versions, reinforced variants that blend cellulose fibres or carbon fibres to reduce abrasive forces and other characteristics of the material.", "In brief, fibre-reinforced thermoplastic applications have opted for the short form in the past, fibres that added strength to the thermoplastic resin when the materials were introduced back in the 1960s. This model of operation is still favoured in packaging today due to the pervading influence of the format, but long-fibre changes are penetrating the market thanks to the tailoring aspect of the moulding material. Regardless of which type is used, the main advantage of the material is that it is lightweight and deceptively strong.

Polyurethane is a popular replacement medium for this task, a substance that spurns abrasion and can be graded to balance durability with elasticity while offering superior resistance to the oil and chemical spills that trouble factory floors. The science of rebonding lays in evaluating the hub of the wheel for bonding viability.

It\u2019s a tough job, but it must be done with assurance and a commitment to obeying stringent regulations, for they\u2019re in place to protect human life, placing the operational efficiency of a chemical process next in order of priority.", "Just to add an additional layer of complexity to the pipes and vessels that shrug off transient temperature changes and bone-crushing pressures, the point between any pipe must receive at least as much consideration when drafting the framework of a processing stages in a chemical plant. Chemicals or fractional components of crude oil, the situation unerringly calls for provisions that account for the weakest point in the flow dynamic. Since metal vessels and pipes have already been inspected before certification, the next weakest stage is the site where the pipes and vessels connect, splitting off into T-joints, 90\u00ba bends, and straight-ended extension joints. Engineering plastic plays a significant role in this connection strategy, one that can\u2019t afford to be put in jeopardy by substandard materials. Elastomers are one solution, the installation of synthetic rubbers with enhanced pliability.", "Defined by a fluoroelastomer molecular structure, Viton is ideally positioned to succeed as the synthetic rubber of choice when installed as a gasket in an environment where harsh chemical reactions and high temperatures are common. The rubber combines the best properties of carbon and fluorine to create specialized formulas where elongation and compression are important characteristics. More impressively, gaskets, hoses, and O-ring seals made from Vitons are commonly manufactured to combat temperature extremes while maintaining high chemical resistance, a property that makes the material perfect for aeronautics, the automotive industry, and applications where corrosive chemicals are constantly present. ", "The fluorocarbon industry is imbued with the responsibility of sealing caustic chemicals through the compression properties of rubber. Here are some of the types of Viton on the market.", "An effective seal against harsh environments and capable of offsetting the ascent and descent changes within an aircraft, Viton is a vital synthetic rubber in the field of high-performance sealants.", "Strezlecki Grove, Laverton VIC 3028", "43 Triholm Avenue, Laverton VIC 3028", "Phone: ", "03 9369 2577", "Fax: ", "03 9369 7117", "Email: ", "enquiries@engplastics.com.au", "Some companies that are in need of quality rubber products find themselves intimidated by the idea of making a direct rubber purchase, opting instead to seek a middle man to facilitate the process. This can become a crucial mistake that tosses aside the many benefits of direct elastomer purchase in exchange for illusionary convenience. There are a couple of things that make this a mistake.", "The first and most obvious mistake is the financial cost. It is an elementary aspect of business that every hand that touches a product from the raw material stage to final product expects to be paid. For any company doing business in today\u2019s competitive marketplace, it is extremely unwise to invite more of these hands into the process. The most cost effective model for getting a custom product is the end purchaser working directly with a company capable of taking the product all the way from concept to complete. ", "The next benefit that comes from purchasing rubber directly is control over the specifics of the product. In any situation where a custom rubber application is required, there are specifics from material characteristics to manufacture methods that will impact the suitability of the end result. Losing this control by choosing to work through a proxy can easily result in a product that is at least not as good as possible and could result in a product that is inadequate altogether. By having a direct input with the company producing the rubber product, the customer vastly reduces the potential of problems.", "The final benefit of buying elastomer straight from the manufacturer is being able to make changes to that product. Using a go-between creates time for messages to be passed from party to party. As an example of how big a problem this could be, picture a company that needs rubber linings for the waste chutes on machines located in thousands of locations. After approving prototypes, the company discovers that some factor has been overlooked \u2013 maybe chemicals that will pass through the chutes or more heat contacting the chutes than previously thought. Working directly with the fabricator, the company can quickly get production stopped while the product is reworked. Should a middle man be involved, a delay or misunderstanding in the message getting passed could result in part after useless part being produced that serve no purpose but must still be paid for. ", "Working with a manufacturer makes sense on many levels. Working with a good manufacturer also eliminates the only possible reason for choosing a middle man in any event \u2013 convenience. A quality rubber producer will be as easy to deal with as any proxy.", "Strezlecki Grove, Laverton VIC 3028", "43 Triholm Avenue, Laverton VIC 3028", "Phone: ", "03 9369 2577", "Fax: ", "03 9369 7117", "Email: ", "enquiries@engplastics.com.au", "Chemically neutral and easy to manufacture, engineering plastics are suitable for all manner of applications. Packaging immediately comes to mind because this inert nature is highly desirable, especially when containment of a reactive substance is an issue. Versatility in form and function is the second factor that propels plastic to the top, presenting molded efficiency alongside design flexibility. Paper and board can be shaped but the material lacks the capacity to soften. Wood is inherently strong but useless for cushioning purposes. Only plastics cushion and mold to any shape with tailored ease as dictated by engineering specs. Chemical processes and heat-treated machining affects the shape and consistency of the substance. One example is the extrusion of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into shapes that offer impact resistance and superior chemical resistance. Of course, the chemical resistance part of this statement can be matched by glass, a popular storage medium, but glass breaks.", "Other forms of rigid plastics include high-density polyethylene and polvinyl chloride (PVC). Each one has its own set of characteristics regarding strength and ability to absorb impact. Again, glass comes out on top in several categories, in holding contamination-free medications in care facilities and medical research laboratories, but rigid plastic is still the dominant substance due to a resistance to breakage. Also, looking at unavoidable practical concerns as we must, glass is heavy and comes from a more expensive manufacturing process. That\u2019s a double-blow when considering the logistics of transportation. The rigid plastic will arrive safe-and-sound, adding little weight to the overall package, but a corresponding package consisting of glass will require extra care due to its fragile nature, and there\u2019s that annoying extra weight to deal with during shipping.", "The rigid category has to come down firmly on the side of rigid plastic. The only flexibility offered by paper is the addition of lamination and corrugation, a big step backward from the versatility of plastic foam or intricately molded storage compartments. Plastic may lose out slightly at the high-end of the medical field due to a slight reactance or absorption property, but class one glass, also known as borosilicate is an expensive material, one used exclusively in pharmaceutical applications.", "Soft engineering plastics are every bit as versatile as their hard-set brethren, but one extra property, elasticity, bespeaks a greater need for pliability and malleability. Plastic bags and blister packs are made from this class of plastic. Polystyrene molded packing holds fragile components stably while absorbing remarkable impact. For an example of elasticity, look to everyday food storage. Sheets of low-density polyethylene conform to every contour of a slice of meat, helping to preserve flavour and hygiene. The same benefit is seen in the home, with leftovers sealed in soft containers and wrapped in plastic film to gift the food with added freshness for several days. The electronics industry adds special anti-static linings to the form, protecting sensitive electronic components from damage. The applications are literally endless, all due to the versatility of polymer engineering and the evolution of packaging.", "Strezlecki Grove, Laverton VIC 3028", "43 Triholm Avenue, Laverton VIC 3028", "Phone: ", "03 9369 2577", "Fax: ", "03 9369 7117", "Email: ", "enquiries@engplastics.com.au", "When it is time to buy quality rubber components for industrial applications, very often one of the early decisions to make is whether to opt for custom fabricated or mass produced rubbers. As with everything, which option is better depends on the specific circumstances of the purchaser. Each choice comes with its own benefits that should be considered.", "The first, and likely most crucial, advantage of mass produced rubber products is price. By the time a rubber component has graduated to the point of being mass produced for sale to many customers, chances are good that the expenses incurred in the design and engineering phases have been recouped. Once this has happened, the mass produced rubber is now a lower overhead product and the manufacturer can shift focus to volume sales. ", "Another key advantage found with mass produced products is availability. This advantage really only applies to very generic products, but for those products it is possible that many manufacturers are actually producing identical parts. When this is the situation, there can be no bottleneck waiting for a single producer to deliver and it becomes possible to shop different suppliers.", "As with all custom products, the biggest advantage is getting exactly the part, made of the exact materials and to the exact specifications required. This benefit is especially important in situations where efficiency and effectiveness are the most desired characteristics of the product. An easy way to see this difference is automobiles. For everyday drivers, squeezing out the last ounce of performance from their vehicles is not going to be the difference between successfully arriving or being stuck at \u2018Go\u2019. On the other hand, race car drivers require superb performance and the difference between good performance and great performance is the difference between making more money than the competition or falling behind. For this reason, where it is allowed virtually all race car parts are custom fabricated. The business world is no less competitive than a car race and the slimmest margin of performance could translate to a terrific advantage over other companies.", "The second key advantage of custom fabrication of rubber products is protection from obsolescence. Industrial equipment can be a massive investment. Having made this investment, a company is now at the mercy of the market when using mass produced parts. Should changes occur in the industry standard, those orphaned machines suddenly become impossible to maintain due to lack of parts. A custom fabricator can always simply make more.", "The choice between custom fabricated and mass produced rubber products boils down to one decision \u2013 Is a lower price and average performance what the buyer wants, or is establishing and maintaining peak performance the desired result?", "Strezlecki Grove, Laverton VIC 3028", "43 Triholm Avenue, Laverton VIC 3028", "Phone: ", "03 9369
