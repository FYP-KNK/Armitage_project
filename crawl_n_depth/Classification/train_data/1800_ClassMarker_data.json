If you are looking for specific facts, how would you ask this question out loud? If you are looking for an explanation, you would probably word this differently. Instead of asking \u201cWhat are the reasons\u201d (multiple choice) or  \u201cAre these the reasons\u201d (yes/no or true/false) you may use \u201cExplain these reason\u201d (essay).

For a True/False question, it's ok to set a lower point value. I mean, it's a 50/50 chance the answer will be correct. However, if giving essay questions for example; set a higher point value.  Why? These questions require more thought and time spent by the user.  You also have more room to work with those points. Good example; A user writes a 1000 word essay answer - it's perfect. They should not receive the same value of 1 point as the person who gave a mediocre 3 word answer, that consists of \u201cWhat's up teach?\u201d  With setting a higher point value, you can give the max points to those who should receive these and points somewhere in the middle for those who almost got it and then lower point values for those who, well made the effort to show up and enter \u201chey\u201d in the text box. \n\t\t", "\n\t\t\tIt's great to use different colors or bolded text but stay away from using light fonts on light backgrounds and dark on dark backgrounds.

Example; favorite / favourite, color /colour, etc. Types of questions users would enter their own answers into can include Free Text, Essay and Grammar question types. If not taken into consideration, users could have their answer graded incorrectly for it actually being correct. This is especially important when you have Test takers taking Tests around the world.\n\t\t", "\n\t\t\tDisplaying the points for what each question is worth can be very beneficial to users taking the Test. You may choose to display these, if for example; you have a timer on the Test and users know they will not be able to answer all questions. They can view the questions with the higher point values to focus more on these.\n\t\t", "\n\t\t\tIf you have a question that requires more than one answer, try using a multiple choice question with multiple responses or an essay style question. Users will then need to think through what the possible answers could be instead of just choosing \u201call of the above\u201d/\u201dnone of the above\u201d.  Think about it - when asked a question where this has been spoken to you, have you ever answered somebody with \u201call of the above\u201d or \u201cnone of the above\u201d.
