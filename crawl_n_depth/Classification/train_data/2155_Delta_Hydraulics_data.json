The force generated by the hydraulics moves the cylinders in two directions - both extending and retracting. It\u2019s why waste equipment provider, Bucher Municipal, exclusively fits them into its Force front loader and UrBin rear loader models. Like a car being crushed at the wreckers, these cylinders will perform the same task, albeit with waste inside a moving vehicle.", "\r\n", "\r\n\u201cThe double acting telescopic cylinders have the ability to extend out and retract under powered hydraulic pressure, making it ideal for compacting waste once it\u2019s picked up by the refuse unit and then emptied into the vehicle\u2019s body,\u201d says Darrin Pritchard, Director of Operations at Bucher.", "\r\n", "\r\nFor more than 20 years, Bucher Municipal has been a client of Delta Hydraulics. On average, Bucher will fit double acting telescopic cylinders in up to 10 units a month in both its front or rear loading waste vehicles.", "\r\nJohn White, Director of Delta Hydraulics, explains the intricacies on how the double acting telescopic cylinders operate. \u201cIn front of piston ported double acting telescopic cylinders, the pistons control the phasing of the cylinder. Once extended, the stage goes into regenerative mode, holding in the extended position and allowing the smaller piston of the next stage to exert force on the load it is crushing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe multi-stages of the cylinders allow for a long length of travel, but with a short, closed retracted length making it suitable for large volume collection vehicles.\u201d", "\r\n", "\r\nThe double acting cylinders also function speeds up to 200mm/sec when in operation. Each stage is microcrack hard chromed. \u201cThe 0.2Ra finished chrome on all stages means that there\u2019s less friction on the seals enabling these operating velocities.\u201d John says. \u201cChrome also helps to prevent corrosion in the cylinders, which in the waste industry is a massive problem considering all the unknown chemicals that can accrue from dumped waste.\u201d", "\r\n", "\r\nThe internal makeup the cylinders consists of hollow stages that dimensionally fit inside one another, and are inside diameter and outside diameter (ID/OD) finished to a strict tolerance. The last stage of each cylinder is equipped with one oil connection to the tension side and one oil connection to the pressure side. The hard seals on the pistons of each stage are needed to limit abrasion between the oil transfer holes and ports over which they must pass. \u201cAll piston ported double acting telescopic cylinders have pistons fitted with seal rings where as single acting cylinders have only a piston fitted with a wearstrip that acts as a guide or stabiliser,\u201d John describes.", "\r\n", "\r\nAccording to John, to allow the cylinders to move freely through each segment, oil-transfer holes are built into each stage. These holes are located just above the pistons in the body of the stage. The retraction port normally is located in the top of the smallest stage. Oil flows through this port and into the smallest stage.", "\r\n\u201cThe piston rod in the middle of the cylinders also extends out and feeds oil to all the stages,\u201d John says. \u201cThe oil transfer hole allows oil to enter and pressurize the volume between the next stages internal diameter and the smaller stages outer diameter. Pressure in this annular area generates the force to move or retract the smaller stage into the larger stage. It\u2019s a complex process, but the way the cylinders are constructed allows for a seamless performance.\u201d", "\r\n", "\r\nHaving dealt with Delta for almost 20 years without any major issues, Bucher didn\u2019t see a need to change the dynamic, even after MacDonald Johnston was acquired in 2004. \u201cJohn White and his team continue to supply quality cylinders that are yet to let us down,\u201d says Joe Kuszer, Procurement Manager for Bucher Municipal. \u201cIf needed, we can simply ask John to customise the cylinders to suit our vehicles, which can include refuse units with just one double acting telescopic cylinder fitted, or sometimes two cylinders.
