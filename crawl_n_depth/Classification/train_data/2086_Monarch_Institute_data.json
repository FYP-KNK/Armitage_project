The trouble with bad debt is that people can often be paying for it long after the holiday has worn off or that new car has halved in value. Also, if bad debt is on a credit card, then it can be all too easy to let the debt roll over each month. Because of the high interest rates that apply to credit cards, initial debts can balloon and take many years to clear.", "Used well, bad debt can be put to good use.

Shortly after the GFC \u2013 around 2010/2011, the Future of Financial Advice (FOFA) reforms were introduced which apparently also delayed many financial planner\u2019s plans to sell their practices.

Fast forward to 2013 and Stephen Prendeville (a specialist broker referred to in the article) says there are now significantly more buyers \u00a0than sellers looking for financial planning practices and consequently he is having a rush of advisers inquiring about selling their practices to meet the demand. With this flurry of activity, it raises an interesting question about how much a financial planning practice is worth these days.", "How are financial planning practices valued?", "From my research which basically consisted of speaking to many people in the industry, financial planning practices sell for about 2 to 3.5 times recurring revenue at the moment. The reason I don\u2019t have better data is that unlike house sales whereby the land titles office allows for the extraction of accurate data, no reliable central database exists for financial planning practice sales unfortunately.

Practices that have systems, processes and designated staff that offer a consistent, and repeatable advisory service \u00a0tend to sell for higher multiples i.e. closer to 3.5 times recurring revenue than less process driven practices. There are still buyers willing to buy a less profitable (or even zero profit) practice where there is a possibility to integrate the new client base being purchased with the\u00a0existing\u00a0practice that already has fixed costs and staff covered. Hopefully the existing practice can absorb the additional clients without incurring significant additional cost, still making the purchase of a \u2018mediocre\u2019 profit or zero profit practice a worthwhile exercise. In that instance a buyer might pay closer to 2 times recurring revenue.", "Change in focus on valuation methodology", "Many in the industry also now say that there is a gradual shift to financial planning practices being transacted based on a multiple of profit (or to be specific EBIT which stands for earnings before interest and tax), rather than straight recurring revenue. But either way, what is evident is that if you own your own financial planning practice, or intend to go down that path, there is the real opportunity to both earn an income whilst you work in the business, but to also receive a significant amount of money when you exit the business.

The way she would build up recurring revenue \u00a0over time would be to engage clients that are happy to pay both a one-off fee for advice but also ongoing yearly fees to review their financial situation, provide ongoing investment advice and effectively have her work for them on a retainer if you like. If she could generate 100 clients willing to pay her $3,000 each per annum (or alternatively 300 clients willing to pay her $1000 per annum), she generates her targeted recurring revenue of $300,000, and now has a valuable business to sell when she chooses to retire, or do something else.", "Is working for myself the way to go?", "No one can answer that question other than you. \u00a0However before jumping in the deep end and taking out a lease (\u2026or quitting your job), go speak to some self employed financial planners who have already taken the leap of faith and get some advice from them.

But whilst we are on the subject of the latter, the Financial Services Minister Bill Shorten\u2019s announcement on 27th April 2012 that the superannuation tax is changing effective July 1st 2012 for people earning $300,000 may be just the start of the government tinkering more with super going forward. That is a serious concern and I\u2019ll explain why shortly. Back to the actual policy initiative announced yesterday. Basically it increases the contributions tax for people earning over $300,000 \u00a0from 15% to 30% \u2013 that\u2019s it. It will generate around $1 billion dollars of revenue so it\u2019s not insignificant from a budget perspective. On the face of it this doesn\u2019t sound too insidious. After all, many people would argue that if you are earning more than $300,000 you probably aren\u2019t as concerned about paying an extra 15% tax on your superannuation concessional contributions anyway, right? Well the first argument is hard to dispute. As indicated by the government, the change impacts only 1.2% of the population in Australia. Unfortunately, the unintended consequence may be the fact many Australians lose trust in the super system. The only losers from this are the public, which is disappointing. Too many changes means the community may become reluctant to utilise super properly and consequently fail to extract the full benefits. \u00a0The community simply doesn\u2019t understand superannuation properly, and many people can\u2019t differentiate between a policy change on the periphery (i.e. this one), and a policy change that will affect them. Let\u2019s face it, super is complex. Unless you have completed a ", "specialist super course", ", or say a ", "Diploma of Financial Planning", " most people are oblivious to the huge benefits it can provide.", "Getting the right advice\u00a0", "The good news is that it presents a huge opportunity for licensed financial advisers to add considerable value to a prospective client\u2019s total situation. By simply restructuring things, people can be hundreds of thousands better off by going to see a financial planner and getting quality advice, often around restructuring investments and using superannuation more effectively. Add to that scope of advice, investment and insurance advice and it is clear why people that are money smart choose to seek the advice of a licensed financial planner to guide them through the regulatory maze. It literally is a matter of being many thousands of dollars better off, so why wouldn\u2019t you see a financial planner? \u00a0So what does a financial planner do these days?

Obviously they need to be ", "fully qualified ", "first.\u00a0\u00a0The problem with the government changing super rules all the time (\u2026yes we are talking about hundreds of changes over the last 20 years) is that the community has a perception problem with super. This means financial planners firstly need to educate clients about what super is, and what super isn\u2019t. We don\u2019t have time to delve too deeply here, but just by way of example, one could be confused for thinking super is no longer suitable or beneficial for the wealthy who earn over $300,000 if they just read a newspaper headline (\u2026or the first paragraph of this article piece). This couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. Super is still an amazing wealth creation structure for all, even after the changes announced yesterday. For example, even if you earn over $300,000 after July 1st 2012, the investment earnings inside super versus outside of super are still taxed at 30% less! Yes 30% less\u2026that is substantial. So while it may be a little less advantageous getting the money into super initially for the \u2018very wealthy\u2019 in certain circumstances (i.e. concessional contributions only), super still presents the best destination for all Australians (\u2026the wealthy included) in a vast number of financial planning scenarios.\u00a0Super has suffered over the last 20 years from a perception problem.

The 3 year claw back is a big departure from the historical industry stance of a 12 month maximum commission claw back for clients that cancelled their policy in the first 12 months. The change seems to have been instigated due to a perceived rise in \u2018rogue\u2019 advisers churning policies whereby they move a client from one insurance policy to the next to generate additional commission, without actually putting the client in a better position. In other words, self serving advice rather than advice that may require a client to swap policies for very sound and valid reasons. Unfortunately, the upshot of this policy is that honest financial advisers may be adversely impacted through no fault of their own when clients for whatever reason cancel their policy in the first 3 years. Because the insurance industry relies on financial advisers doing the majority of the leg work required to get a client to take out a policy in the first instance (i.e. quotations, applications, underwriting etc), it is disheartening the insurance companies are attacking the same people (advisers) they rely on for their own success.
