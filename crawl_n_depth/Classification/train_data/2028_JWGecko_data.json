We have subscribed to this list (it\u2019s not free any more) to keep our validation routines up to date. One quirky issue that arose this year was that many people are now using Google Maps to verify addresses. While this is theoretically more accurate than the Australia Post list because it is aware of street names and maximum numbers, we did find a notable discrepancy in that Google has \u201cST. IVES\u201d but Australian Post has \u201cST IVES\u201d (no period). Then there was the usual range of misspellings and simply picking the wrong post code for the suburb \u2013 often due to the student providing the wrong data. We would encourage RTOs to make your data entry operators aware of these issues and try to check the data provided as students sometimes really \u201cdon\u2019t know their own address\u201d.", "It is a requirement under the Data Provisioning Act that RTOs collect a residential address for all students residing onshore during training (including international students studying in Australia). Again, it is worth putting in place procedures during enrolment that a residential address is collected as we found numerous examples of putting \u201cPO Box 123\u201d in the building or street name field.

The short course exemption has been stopped as of 1/1/2018 and the only remaining exemptions are for learners in security-related professions due to other legislation which explicitly prevents them from being tracked on insecure systems. NCVER is pushing for USIs to be collected prior to starting training rather than just before parchments are issued, so that USIs are available in initial and midway data sets used for funding claims. One could argue whether there is a legislative basis for this, but the current \u201cpath of least resistance for RTOs\u201d is to collect USIs prior to starting, or on the first day if practical.", "This is a regular part of the student data in enrolment forms but due to it\u2019s unique position in the enrolment details and not the student details (a student can do several courses for different reasons) it often gets missed out of the process. RTOs should ensure that their processes systematically collect and record this value. It is sometimes possible to make reasonable assumptions at the end of the year for some courses based on the context of the course, but this is not always the case and mass after-the-fact collection is usually impractical, so it is important that this is done continuously during the year.", "This is a common issue for courses with flexible delivery or where there is a poor participation rate (for whatever reason).

Thus, many units are left supposedly finished but with not final outcome.

While the overhaul of the income contingent loan scheme (now renamed VET Student Loans) was a necessary step, there was a clear need to update the auditing and monitoring processes so that it would identify these practices by focusing on the student\u2019s perspective. They ask the questions: \u201cDid the students feel they were treated fairly and honestly; and were provided with a high quality training service which met their needs?\u201d", "The new auditing regime by ASQA (mirrored for the most part by the VIC and WA regulators) splits the main focus from rigorous and valid assessment processes to an even split between assessment and what has been called \u201cthe student journey\u201d. In effect this means that RTOs need to keep records of all interactions with clients from the point of first contact to post-completion follow up, and ensure that at all times, the student is provided with correct information, offered and provided with all of the required options (prior learning, special needs, cancellation options, complaint and dispute handling, etc).", "While this was always good business practice, only the documented process was reviewed at audit and rarely was the actual implementation examined.

Please talk to us if you want to discuss how we can support you to implement these features and build a record of your \u201cstudents journeys\u201d.", "When an RTO is scheduled for an ASQA audit, they are asked to provide details of the volume of students in each qualification and stand-alone units on their scope; and a list of student contacts (or a random selection of 1000 if there are more than that).
