Children can drown any time of year. Accidental drowning is the leading cause of death in children under 5. Participating in formal swimming lessons throughout the whole year is associated with an 88% reduction in the risk of drowning in children between 1 and 4 (although this is just one step in building the layers of safer swimming).", "Repetition is key to the process of learning to swim. A break over winter can result in a plateau or even a regression in skills. It\u2019s all about muscle memory and muscle memory is all about consistent, long term skill retention. A sustained break may lead to children having to relearn skills that they lost over winter, and for those children who took a little longer being comfortable in their lessons, they may need to rebuild water confidence and a love for the water.", "This one is fairly obvious. There\u2019s a reason why people who are undergoing rehabilitation will often have a significant swimming component in their program. It is low impact and accessible to people of all ages; it provides a great cardiovascular workout as well as a workout for the whole body including the arms, back and shoulders. As swimming builds fitness, stamina and strength, it can also help your child excel at other sports such as soccer, football, gymnastics and dance.", "Several studies, including one by Griffith University, investigated whether young children gain more than just swimming skills if they participate in early years swimming lessons. The results were impressive. Not only are swimming children more physically able, they also score significantly better on oral expression, literacy, numeracy and socially.", "Winter is the perfect time to progress your child\u2019s swimming skills so that when the warmer months roll around, they are ready for hours of fun playing in the pool, at the beach and enjoying water-based family holidays. The progress your child will make in the winter months, quite simply, cannot be made up in a matter of weeks.", "If your kids are going to be taking swimming lessons in winter (which they should!), make it as comfortable as possible for them.

It may be a bit heavy-handed but the sentiment is true. Before you even consider swimming lessons, think about other ways to get your children used to water. The easiest (and loveliest) way to do this is by using the bath or shower \u2014 using a flannel and eventually a cup, the baby can gently be introduced to the sensation of water on their face. Just be mindful that you want bath time to be a happy and relaxed time. Zen, now.", "Now that you have bath times mastered and you\u2019re graduating to the pool and swimming lessons, think about how you feel around water. Anxious parents make anxious swimmers. Try to relax, your kids are in good hands. And if you\u2019re afraid of water, consider taking lessons yourself so you can comfortably join your children in the pool \u2014 you\u2019re never too old to learn how to swim.", "The single biggest factor in helping your kids love the water is getting them into the water early and often. Visit the pool without any pressure to get in. Allow your kids to become familiar with the different sights and sounds of a swimming pool. Let them observe and let their curiosity drive the experience. Frequent visits to the pool make the water normal, nothing to be feared (as long as you follow simple rules), so sign up for those baby or toddler classes or take your kids to the local aquatic centre to play.", "Baby swimming lessons are all about learning to love the water \u2014 playing games and singing songs to allay any fears, all the while getting key safety messages. Young children learn more quickly when parents interact with them in the pool, so make it a family activity. And have fun.", "If you have a child who already has an intense reaction to the pool environment, think about why they\u2019re reluctant\u2026 Have they had a bad experience? Is the pool too cold or too noisy? Are they shy and unsure of swimming with their instructor?", "There are many reasons why children may be reluctant to get in the pool but if we know why, then we can work out how to \u2018grow their gills\u2019.

If swimming lessons are the most challenging half an hour of your week, talk to the supervisor (blue shirt, orange iPad). If that doesn\u2019t work, change it up \u2014 days, teachers, time of the day. Start swimming for fun. Remember the joy of swimming, just for pleasure (as long as you are comfortable in the pool).", "It might be something as simple as a cold changing room or a pool that gets waves that puts your child off swimming. Try a different location. Make the most of available swimming pools on your summer holiday, when they may be encouraged by seeing other children having fun swimming outdoors in the sun.", "Peer pressure can work wonders in encouraging reluctant children into the water. Take them to watch older siblings, or arrange to go swimming with a friend who has children of a similar age who love to swim. Go into the water with your child so you can stay close to them and show them there is nothing to fear.", "Respond to their concerns.
