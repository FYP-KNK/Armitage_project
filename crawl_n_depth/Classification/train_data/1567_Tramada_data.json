The topic: the New Distribution Capability, or NDC. Here we share highlights from their intriguing discussion.", "Mike:\u00a0 In layman\u2019s terms, what is NDC?", "Bj\u00f6rn:", "\u00a0 Technically, the NDC is a set of standard XMLs, or computer code, that support flight bookings maintained by IATA. Their aim is for airlines and intermediaries to focus on product and service innovation rather than on solving technical complex problems. The standard (the code) itself is neither exciting nor innovative; it is functional. But what it enables \u2013 the personalisation of offers beyond what\u2019s possible today with private fares \u2013 is very exciting. Essentially, the NDC enables airlines to offer their products through multiple channels and in ways not possible until now.", "Mike: The industry\u2019s been talking about the NDC for several years, since at least 2012, so it isn\u2019t new. Why is it important now?\u00a0", "Bj\u00f6rn:", " What\u2019s important is that talk about the NDC is now quickly becoming action, and anyone who\u2019s not acting\u00a0today runs the risk of not being able to offer the same personalised products and services as those offered by agencies and TMCs who are NDC-ready.", "Mike: \u00a0What benefits do you see NDC bringing to travel agents and travellers?", "Bj\u00f6rn:", "\u00a0 Travel agents, in co-operation with airlines, are now able to tailor offers to suit specific companies, and even personalise offers at the traveller level. Currently, this is restricted by booking classes and/or private fares.", "And while it\u2019s true that many successful TMCs and travel agencies pride themselves in offering personalised services, the advent of the NDC means they will now also be able to offer personalised fares and customised bundled offers.", "Mike: Are there any risks to travel agents from the NDC?", "Bj\u00f6rn:", " There are risks for some, opportunity for others. Given that the NDC makes it possible to personalise offers to a much more sophisticated degree, it will be a real advantage for TMCs and airlines who work together on this. The questionable part of it, however, is how manageable all this is at scale. That is, is it likely that airlines will be selective in who they work with \u2013 which is what\u2019s happening today with private fares.", "There\u2019s also an operational risk, or overhead, involved. That\u2019s because without scalable back-end processes, the NDC could possibly result in a lot of additional manual effort for agents. And this is where ", "tramada\u00ae", " comes to the fore because the platform provides the same post-booking automation capabilities regardless of booking channel.", "Mike: I hear Tramada has had a big team working on NDC for quite some time, can you tell us what you have been working on?", "Bj\u00f6rn: ", "\u00a0Many NDC presentations talk about the NDC offering airlines the ability to personalise and tailor offers, similar to, say, Amazon, as a way to describe the possibilities in terms of the shopping experience. While that\u2019s true, we like to take this analogy one step further.", "Let me explain: as we all know, where Amazon really excels is in supply chain management, or getting the ordered products to the customer fast, reliably and inexpensively. Even more than its ability to tailor the shopping experience, it\u2019s Amazon\u2019s ability to offer hyper-efficient, post-shopping processes, at scale, that really sets Amazon apart from its competitors.", "In much the same way, what ", "tramada", " does is to streamline and automate the ", "post", "\u2013", "booking", " processes. This means ", "tramada", "-enabled TMCs and travel agencies can offer personalised fares and offers to their clients and travellers, while at the same time having robust, scalable, secure and automated post-booking processes. It\u2019s always been ", "tramada", "\u2019s value proposition to streamline and automate post-booking processes such as application of service fees, creation and sending itineraries and invoices, receipting etc., \u2013 all regardless of the booking source.", "Going forward, it simply won\u2019t be sustainable for agents to be solely dependent on GDSs for any of these processes with the NDC. With other booking sources in addition to GDSs already in the mix, for ", "tramada", " users it is business as usual. The solution has been designed with multiple booking sources in mind and is already integrating with multiple booking sources, so the NDC is simply another extension to this capability.", "And you mention our team that\u2019s been working on the NDC for some time \u2013 yes, and we have had live NDC bookings come in since December. \u00a0We are committed to ensuring our clients enjoy post-booking processes for NDC content that are as automated as they are for GDS content. And again, this is a key requirement for agencies because the industry trend is clearly to automate post-booking processes. So for the NDC to become mainstream and accepted by TMCs, agencies absolutely require the same level of automation for NDC bookings as for GDS bookings.", "Mike: How will Tramada help agents merge inventory sources and enable a shopping experience that spans all content?", "Bj\u00f6rn:", " In ", "tramada", ", content from multiple booking sources is automatically merged into the booking it belongs to. That is, a booking in ", "tramada", " can contain both NDC and GDS content as well as, for example, Expedia TAAP content. There is no \u201cshopping experience\u201d in ", "tramada", " because the solution is 100% post-booking.", "Mike: \u00a0Rich content enabled by NDC sounds great, but how do we make it work operationally?\u00a0How does the agent manage issuance of itineraries, changes, payment and refunds in an NDC world?", "Bj\u00f6rn:", " Today ", "tramada ", "leverages existing and proven functionality, at scale, and business rules to support the issuing of itineraries, managing changes and refunds from an accounting perspective as well as payment gateway integrations. This capability is another key benefit of the solution \u2013 processes and functionality is all the same when adding NDC content into ", "tramada", ", and there\u2019s no need for TMCs to retrain staff or re-build current integrations.", "Mike: With all the extra data that can potentially be captured from NDC content, how will this be available to and benefit agents?", "Bj\u00f6rn:", " Reporting capabilities are key. The embedded reporting suite in ", "tramada", " combines content irrespective of booking source. An example is the Yield Management report, used to compare GDS margins versus NDC margins, and ", "tramada", " users can improve overall margins by breaking this information down per bundle to analyse and refine the products they offer. Structured data is the vital to personalising offers and data, and the ", "tramada", " solution plays a pivotal role in this.", "For example, let\u2019s say that airline X plans to commence a new route to a city that it hasn\u2019t flown to before. Together with TMC Y, airline X can look at the number of room nights for that particular city as part of determining the route\u2019s feasibility.", "The next step would be using the data available in ", "tramada", " for airline X and TMC Y to personalise offers for travellers who frequent that specific route using, for example, additional Frequent Flyer points or status credit points, discounts on a specific restaurant, etc.", "To be sure, this involves issues around data privacy, commercials etc. that need to be resolved, but this scenario illustrates the opportunities that are there \u2013 and it\u2019s just one example of innovation the NDC presents in the ability to offer products from airlines that that hasn\u2019t been possible in the past.", "Mike: \u00a0Does anything change with duty of care solutions?", "Bj\u00f6rn:", " From a duty-of-care perspective, what\u2019s important is to know who is where and when they\u2019re there. That\u2019s basic information regardless of booking source, and TMCs need to be able to manage this holistically", "tramada", " makes this easy by presenting passenger location information in a single dashboard, regardless of booking source. Plus, we have integrations with duty-of-care providers such as iSOS and Concur Risk Messaging, including content from all booking sources. We absorb the complexity in ", "tramada", " and integrate with the full set of bookings that we receive, whether GDS, NDC or other.", "Mike: What are you most excited about for the next six months in terms of NDC?", "Bj\u00f6rn:", " Tramada already has clients live with NDC, so in the next six months I\u2019m expecting to see at-scale implementations by our clients with the NDC as well as a range of airline and solution providers.
