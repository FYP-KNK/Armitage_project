Although checking pressures, regular rotation and alignment are all standard items on a modern tyre maintenance checklist, Mat says that checking shock absorbers should also be added to the list. \u201cAs an important component to the axle and suspension set up, it may\u00a0seem unusual to suggest that shock absorbers should be part of a tyre maintenance program, as well as a suspension check. But the truth is that shock absorbers fulfil an essential role in getting the best cost per km ratio out of tyres,\u201d explains Mathew.", "\u201cGetting back to the basics, the main role of the shock absorber is to control the oscillation of the vehicle\u2019s spring, whether it is a multi-leaf, parabolic or air spring. By controlling the movement of the spring, the shock keeps the vehicle\u2019s tyres in contact with the road surface, which has an overall effect on braking, handling and stability.\u201d Worn out shock absorbers or units that are not designed for harsh Australian roads will allow a tyre to bounce on the road surface in an uncontrolled manner, Mathew adds, which can result in flat patches or \u201cscalloping\u201d on the tread surface of the tyre. \u201cThis inconsistent type of tyre wear happens due to the tread scuffing the road surface at high speeds, however aconsistent wear pattern could be the result of an alignment issue or a worn suspension bush,\u201d he says.", "According to Mathew, the simplest way to check if shock absorbers are in a good operating condition is through visual inspections for oil leaks or physical damage and by performing heat tests while the shocks are fitted to the truck or trailer. \u201cTo carry out a heat test, stop the vehicle and immediately get out of the cab and place a hand on the chassis rail to feel the operating temperature of the truck or trailer. Using your other hand, place two fingers on the body of the shock absorber, being careful as shocks can get really hot. The temperature of the shock absorber should be hotter than the temperature of the chassis rail,\u201d says Mathew. \u201cThe temperature of the shock absorbers on the same axle can vary: the left side may be a little hotter due the crown or drop off of the road, or depending on load and weight distribution.", "\n", "\u201cWith the introduction of new innovations such as the Low Pressure Gas technology trailer shock absorbers, Powerdown can offer a suspension solution to any unique operating condition.\u201d", "The main point is that a working shock absorber should be dissipating heat, but try to get to them as soon as you stop, as they will cool down fast.\u201d If the shock absorber is stone cold, Mat says there is a good chance that it needs further inspection and likely replacement. When replacing worn out shock absorbers, Mathew recommends installing components that have been designed for Australia\u2019s harsh operating environment and conditions. \u201cFor more than 30 years, Powerdown has designed and developed the largest selection of commercial vehicle shock absorbers in Australia, which have proven themselves over millions of kms,\u201d says Mathew. \u201cWith the introduction of new innovations such as the Low Pressure Gas technology trailer shock absorbers, Powerdown can offer a suspension solution to any unique operating condition that will help get the most out of tyre wear.\u201d", "Filpro Automotive, a supplier of automotive aftermarket products, acquired a manufacturer of ride control components, Powerdown Australia, on February 18th,...", "The Brisbane Truck Show is an unparalleled showcase of the very best our industry has to offer and Powerdown are...", "PO Box 370 Beresfield", "\nNSW 2322, Australia", "P", " 02 4949 0000", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "F", " 02 4949 0099", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "E", " ", "sales@powerdown.com.au", "\u00a9 Copyright 2015 Powerdown.

This acts as a hydraulic cushion of oil which slows the suspension components in a controlled fashion as the suspension reaches the end of it extended travel. This feature is essential when the shock absorbers are used as the primary suspension travel limiter or especially when the trailer is used in conditions where it reaches it maximum travel regularly.

This acts as a hydraulic cushion of oil which slows the suspension components in a controlled fashion as the suspension reaches the end of its extended travel. This feature is essential when the shock absorbers are used as the primary suspension travel limiter or especially when the truck or trailer is used in conditions where it reaches it maximum travel regularly.", "Changing the ride height on your truck or trailer air suspension, maybe a quick fix for a drive line angle issue or reaching a certain king pin height on a trailer.", "One of the most common problems Powerdown encounter when receiving calls about suspension related issues, is the ride height of the rear air suspension or trailer suspension has been adjusted above the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturers) recommendations. Unfortunately, these quick fix changes will eventually lead to some expensive headaches in the future.", "Shocking Wear", "A shock absorber is primarily designed to operate in the midpoint of the extended and compressed length of the unit.", "By increasing the ride height of the suspension, the suspension droop is reduced which limits the downwards travel available in the shock absorber. This dramatically increases the likelihood of the damper topping out when the suspension articulates. The piston will effectively hit the top guide of the shock absorber causing fatigue issues in the design. A re-coil cut off or rebound stop will limit some of the damage in the short term, but this feature is not designed for continual topping out of the unit. This will also lead to premature bush failure and other related end fitting damage.", "Eventually over time the shock absorber will most likely leak oil due to internal damage from the constant impact. In extreme cases the life of the shock absorber can be reduced by 80% of its normal service life.", "Short stroke shock absorbers on trailers and some rear drive air suspensions are more susceptible than others.", "In an industry first Powerdown has released a select range of shock absorbers with a recommended ride height sticker. This sticker is designed to indicate where the shock absorber is operating in terms of stroke when the shock absorber is fitted to the vehicle.", "The sticker is strategically placed on the body of the shock absorber to indicate shock absorber stroke relative to vehicle ride height.", "If the dust shield edge is in the GREEN zone then the vehicle ride height is correct. This is where optimum performance of the shock absorber is achieved.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "\u00a0If the dust shield edge is in the AMBER/YELLOW zone (on either the top or bottom end) the ride height should be checked.

This indicates that the likelihood of the shock absorber topping out or bottoming out is highly increased over time. This may also mean that the wrong shock for the application has been fitted.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "If the shock absorber falls into the AMBER/YELLOW or RED zones it is highly recommended that the ride height of the suspension is checked in accordance with the OEM recommendations. This will help avoid premature wear and tear, not only to the shock absorbers, but to the entire suspension of your vehicle.", "The main benefit of a larger bore size is the internal operating pressure of the shock absorber is spread over a larger piston surface area that has a direct impact on shock absorber longevity and performance.", "In our quest to improve the design of our shock absorbers in certain applications, Powerdown have introduced a larger 45 mm disc valve design. The new units further benefit from improved speed sensing disc valving which adapts quicker to different road conditions. This calibration greatly improves wind stability, body roll through cornering and control through dips and potholes.", "A key advantage of the new disc valve design is high tunability where we can develop unique valve codes for high dampening forces required for some forward of the axle trailer applications. Upon reaching a certain force / velocity our engineering team can \u201cblow off\u201d the valving to stabilise the dampening. The key advantage of this function is that less strain is placed on shock mounting bolts and bushings in high force applications.", "Air suspensions are specifically designed to be load sharing with air flowing between the air bags to accommodate the transfer of weight on the truck or trailer. The air in the system is regulated by a height control valve which pumps and exhausts air based on the load and the dynamic road conditions.", "Due to these load sharing characteristics, trailers with a high centre of gravity or in a dolly configuration can experience a surge of air volume from the front to the rear. On some occasions, this surge can be side to side within the air bag system; this can momentarily render the platform unstable, making continuous driver correction necessary.", "Powerdown, in conjunction with Hadley one of America\u2019s largest height control valve manufacturers, have developed a new cross flow air valve. A simple and cost effective design has been used to control the surge from front to rear and side to side that can lead to a trailer or dolly exhibiting a sensation of instability. Air will continue to flow, but this will happen in a more controlled manner whilst maintaining the load sharing ability of the suspension. This can have an effect on tyre wear, but will also greatly reduce driver fatigue in multi combination vehicles.", "The new cross flow valve will soon be available in high (blue valve) or medium flow rates (black valve) to suit the operator\u2019s requirements.", "Filpro Automotive, a supplier of automotive aftermarket products, acquired a manufacturer of ride control components, Powerdown Australia, on February 18th,...", "The Brisbane Truck Show is an unparalleled showcase of the very best our industry has to offer and Powerdown are...", "PO Box 370 Beresfield", "\nNSW 2322, Australia", "P", " 02 4949 0000", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "F", " 02 4949 0099", "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "E", " ", "sales@powerdown.com.au", "\u00a9 Copyright 2015 Powerdown.
