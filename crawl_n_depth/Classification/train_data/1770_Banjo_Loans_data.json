When we consider the SME-lender relationships discussed above, and how these relationships have suffered in recent years, we begin to see working with a third party broker -- someone who is better equipped to develop this real, mutually beneficial relationship -- would become more attractive.", "Another factor is that it is becoming difficult for SMEs to secure funding via traditional means. A broker can open up a world of other possibilities for businesses, greatly increasing their chances of achieving the line of credit they need. But what exactly are these alternatives, and why are they so valuable for SMEs?", "Tighter credit conditions have made it more difficult for Australian businesses to secure the funding they need.

The burden of proof now rests with the loan provider to show that they carried out the necessary checks.", "These checks include ensuring that the company has held an ABN for at least one year prior to the applications, as well as credit checks and other assessments.", "The trouble is, small businesses do not generally turn to low doc loans by choice. Instead, they explore this option because they lack the documentation required to acquire loans of other types. To put it simply, they have nowhere else to turn.", "Or at least they didn't have. The financial technology, or fintech, revolution is beginning to provide real alternatives to these risky credit facilities, and streamlined application and decision processes are enticing increasing numbers of SMEs in this direction.", "But it is not just ease of access which is turning small businesses towards the fintech option.

The longer the inventory remains unsold, the longer it takes to collect the accounts receivables.
