The significance score can range from 1 to 25, with 25 being the most significant.", "Slow performance, buggy software and frequent crashes were highlighted as the most significant issue that has a negative impact on genetic software user experience. The people most affected by this issue were clinic administrators, researchers and data managers.", "Performance issues particularly affected commercial software purchased from independent software vendors and central Hospital Information Systems. Commercial software scored a 60% significance rating this area, with Hospital Information Systems closely behind at 56%.", "Software and system performance is a complex area, which many factors that can impact on performance. Slow performance and crashes may be a result of poorly coded software, inadequate hardware allocation, database server performance, network latency and perhaps more likely, a combination of all of these factors. Developers of genetics software and systems can have a positive influence in this area by writing software that makes good and efficient use of hardware resources to run as efficiently as possible. The system as a whole needs a well designed application architecture to identify and resolve potential bottlenecks. Providing technical support to customers to help to identify causes of poor performance and working with IT departments to resolve any issues found will further improve user experience.", "The second most significant issue identified was the lack of features in the system being used, indicating that there are user requirements that have not been met. Hospital Information Systems and in house Access databases were the most significantly affected by this issue. There is a lack of control over the features that can be included in very generic Hospital Information Systems, often used solely for demographics and referral and appointment management. Home grown systems, such as Access databases, will always be limited by the capabilities and resources available in house; in some cases this may be a single clinician who is developing the database on the side of their clinical role and this will limit the features that can be developed. Commercial software purchased from independent software vendors were shown to have the most features and provided higher levels of satisfaction.\u00a0Specialist registrars, researchers and data managers are the roles that are most affected by the lack of features available.", "Clinical users, such as researchers, specialist registrars and consultants, were the users that were most impacted by the inability to get useful information out of various genetics systems. Hospital Information Systems and Excel Spreadsheets were more greatly affected than other types of system.", "Data visualisation tools, such as ", "Microsoft Power BI", ", have been coming to the market and offer more sophisticated analysis and data visualisations; these tools also include the ability to load data from multiple systems to produce reports that combine various data sets. Growing awareness around how data can be used to add more value is also raising the expectations of genetics software users regarding what they want from their systems.", "In addition to addressing performance issues and developing new features, genetics software vendors need to reconsider the value of the data in their systems and how various genetics users wish to utilise this data.

The most satisfied users were those who had purchased a genetics information system from a software vendor, who were 70% satisfied on average.", "Satisfaction with central Patient Administration Systems (PAS) was also slightly higher than the average; this was a surprising result in light of the fact that PAS systems do not include the specific features required by genetics users. We considered whether these results might have been due to responses from administrators using PAS systems, but in fact it was consultants and specialist registrars.", "Those with the least satisfaction in their genetics information system were those that were using paper records or in-house Access databases. This was an expected result because of the inefficiencies of paper based records and the lack of support and quality assurance with in-house Access databases. The average satisfaction of genetics services that relied on paper based systems and in-house Access databases was 40%, 20% lower than the overall average satisfaction.", "Genetics Nurse counsellors had the lowest levels of satisfaction with in-house Access databases. This could be due to the lack of pedigree drawing features that would be an important feature of genetics nurse counsellors. The service administrators had the lowest satisfaction in paper records, which again is unsurprising due to the extra administrator burden of dealing with such records.", "There were a number of respondents who primary used Excel as a genetics IT system to manage their patient records. \u00a0Further investigation revealed that those using Excel were researchers, who likely needed a quick way to capture and record data about patients who had consented to be part of the research.", "It is perhaps not surprising that the most satisfied users of genetics IT systems are those that have purchased a solution from a commercial provided that has invested in the development of a specific solution.
