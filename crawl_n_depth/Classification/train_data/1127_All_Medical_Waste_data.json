We will take a look at these various categories below.", "This makes up the lion\u2019s share of all the waste that is generated at medical facilities. It is not that different from office or household waste. It includes our day to day waste such as plastics, paper and liquids. It is not considered to be biologically, physically or chemically hazardous and can be disposed of without any problems. It does not require any special handling since it includes normal things that we use in our day to day operations and it is also not toxic.", "As the name suggests, this is any type of waste that can cause infections to human beings, animals and the environment. It is mainly waste that is contaminated with blood and other bodily fluids. Medical gloves should be worn when handling any blood, or bodily fluids to also avoid contamination and prevent yourself from contracting dangerous diseases. It can include human or animal tissue, discarded surgical gloves used in surgery or handling blood or even pathological waste. It also involves swabs or stocks that are used in cultures. ", "All of these examples listed require different treatment methods to get rid of them. You cannot discard them in the same way as regular waste. They also have different rules for their storage, transport, licensing and processing. It is because they are very delicate and need to be handled with the utmost care. Some of the ways to treat these infectious wastes include, but are not limited to, autoclaving, steam treatment and also incineration. We can treat them chemically and also use microwaving. There should be no compromises since this type of waste is dangerous.", "This waste refers to any liquid or solid that is considered to be toxic, chemically reactive and also flammable. It is non-recyclable and it is dangerous, but it is not considered to be infectious to human beings. Sharps that have not been used belong to this category since they can harm the user and cause injuries. Examples of sharps are needles, syringes, scalpels and other glassware in the hospital.

This type of garbage should be stored in an area that is dedicated such as under a roof. It should have a sprinkler or fire suppression system since it is flammable. It should also not be stored in areas where people frequently visit. It should be kept away from human contact.", "Any waste that contains radioactive materials is considered to be radioactive waste. They are by-products of nuclear power generation and the use of nuclear technology. Wondering where this comes from in hospitals? Worry not. Some of the examples are radioactive therapies for tests such as thallium stress and also other nuclear therapies used to treat some types of cancers we have today. These nuclear medicines use radiation and its technology to provide valuable information about the state of the patients\u2019 organs that have been affected by cancer. ", "Any pathological waste that is contaminated with radioactive material is also classified as dangerous waste instead of its infectious counterpart. It also cannot be recycled since it is very toxic and hazardous to our health. Chemotherapeutic agents should be incinerated or chemically neutralised.

Hence, unmanaged waste of this manner is a public health concern. Many governments and medical organisations have worked together to come up with strict policies and legislation that ensure that this type of waste is handled and disposed of safely and efficiently. ", "Professionals who are new to the handling of biomedical waste should immediately acquaint themselves with the protocols used for the various types of waste which will be discussed further in this article. Generally, it is imperative for individuals that foresee themselves coming into contact with biomedical waste to consult local waste management services which have expertise in biomedical waste.

Many waste management services can provide an extensive service that will take care of all of the different kinds of medical waste that a particular professional may need to dispose of.", "One common type of medical waste is radioactive medical waste. This type of waste is often created as a byproduct of diagnosis and treatments that require the use of radioactive medicine. There is a vast amount of different applications for radioactive medicine, which leads to a massive buildup with this type of waste in most medical facilities. Radioactive waste is mostly created in facilities which provide medical imagery. X-rays and other forms of diagnostic imaging are entirely dependent on the use of radioactive materials in order to be produced. The facilities which facilitate these imagery techniques will need strict procedures for the handling of radioactive materials as well as the disposal of the radioactive waste that is created. ", "Radioactive waste is also created through many different treatments, such as radiotherapy which is commonly used for many different cancers. In the same manner as medical imagery that uses radioactive materials, radioactive therapies also create a large amount of this type of waste. Any manager of a medical service which provides either medical imagery or radioactive treatments should organise for the safe disposal of the waste that is produced. ", "Perhaps the most common type of medical waste witnessed in hospitals is infectious medical waste. Many times, through the treatment and diagnosis of the vast array of diseases and conditions that are seen in many major hospitals around the country, a multitude of infectious waste is created. Infectious waste is waste that has the potential of causing illness and disease to those that come into contact with it. As many people know, blood, mucus, and a range of other types of biological materials produced by the body have the potential to cause disease in others. ", "Treatments that involve bandages will often require the used bandages to be categorised as infectious waste and must be disposed of according to infectious waste protocols. Swabs and other diagnostic tests that involve such biological materials like blood must also be carefully disposed of according to protocols. Infectious waste must be handled properly to ensure public safety, even small medical facilities will most likely experience a buildup of infectious waste, thus they should arrange for safe disposal.", "In contrast to infectious waste, hazardous waste isn\u2019t contagious. However, hazardous waste is still hazardous as it involves any waste that could cause injury or harm to those that either are exposed to or come into contact with it.
