These drugs decrease the number of pain signals your brain receives and change the way your brain responds to pain. People commonly use them for toothaches, recovery from surgeries or injuries, and chronic conditions such as cancer. Certain prescription cough medicines also contain opioids. When used correctly, opioids are usually safe. The problem is that many people abuse opioids by taking the drugs more often or for longer than their doctor prescribes, or by taking them when they don\u2019t need to at all. Eventually, you lose control over your choice to take the drugs. Your brain changes in response to the drug\u2019s pleasurable effects and creates a powerful urge to keep using the drug, even when you don\u2019t need it anymore.

Opioid overdose is a medical emergency and is characterised by unresponsiveness, slow or no breathing, slow or no pulse, vomiting, and constricted pupils.", "What Causes Opioid Addiction?", "When you take opioids over time, your body develops a tolerance to their effects, and you will require higher and higher doses to feel the same way. When you stop using the drug for a while, your tolerance fades. When you take opioids for a long enough period, the way your body works changes in ways that cause you to have withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking the drug. These withdrawal symptoms may be mild or severe and include sweating, nausea, vomiting, shaking, chills, pain, and insomnia. If it seems that you can\u2019t function properly without the drug, and you seek it out obsessively despite the problems it causes in your life, this is addiction. It is a disease \u2013 a treatable one.", "Each person experiences holistic rehab in Melbourne for opioid addiction differently, but there are always two main goals: to help you stop using the drug and to help you avoid using it again in the future. To help you stop using the drug (detox), you may receive certain medications that control your cravings and relieve withdrawal symptoms.

I had managed to stop using hard/party drugs daily a year or so ago, and had cut it down to benders every few weeks and just using benzo\u2019s on a daily basis to keep me \u201c comfortable\u201d . But I kept picking up the drugs again and I had noticed that each time I used now I was using heavier and being more risky to the point where I was always mixing multiple drugs at once and it was completely out of my control as to how much I was taking at a time and how long it took me to stop once id started. When I wasn\u2019t using I was obsessing over the next time I would and my mind and life were just completely out of control. In the past year I had also started using drugs that I thought I never would, and had recently been using heroin intravenously. I always said that was something that I would never do. The truth is that addiction is a progressive illness, and it had proved to me that I was no longer ever going to be able to control it, maintain a certain amount over a period of time or even minimise the risk factors involved. The last time I used had resulted in an overdose and I knew that this was my bottom line. Within a week of having that overdose I had started to have obsessive and overpowering thoughts to use again. I knew I was in real trouble then, and I felt so alone with my thoughts about wanting to use again after that experience. After I came around from the overdose I went out to my kitchen and used again, the same drug from the same batch that had just knocked me off. Was I crazy? I certainly felt so. I knew this was it for me- I had to get clean for good, but I just couldn\u2019t do it on my own. I was sick of being a \u201cdruggie\u201d, and I wanted out for good, but I knew I needed structure and routine along with proper education on how to put the drugs down and STAY stopped.

Wow, this was a new concept to me but it made so much sense. I also got reacquainted with the fact that depression is when I turn my anger inward and don\u2019t express it. I feel like I have options with dealing with my anger besides either pushing it down and pretending it\u2019s not there, or throwing objects at people or trying to harm myself.

If it\u2019s one that you have struggled with personally, then it will be natural for you to have many questions about the process, about how to improve your situation, and about where you can turn for proper alcohol addiction treatment in Melbourne. How long is a treatment program? Where is the facility? How large is it? What are your methods? The list of pertinent details you may need can get rather long, and you\u2019ll need reliable information that you can trust.

We operate two options regarding where to go. For our comprehensive addiction treatment, our country retreat in Victoria is the recommended choice. Montserrat is a 12-week inpatient program at a 20-bed facility, located on 76 acres of land. The atmosphere is serene, and the environment is one that promotes positive change and self-reflection. Tranquil, beautiful, picturesque views will allow you respite while you begin your journey of recovery. The supportive, drug-free environment grants the opportunity to connect with nature and gain a new perspective on your life. This location permits a broad range of relaxing activities: art, massage, yoga, hiking, music, swimming, cooking, etc. You will gain insight as you engage in these therapeutic pastimes, backed up by 24/7 access to counsellors and support workers, along with a twelve-step program and the supportive network of Alcoholic Anonymous.", "Our second center, the Wellington Street House in Saint Kilda, is a two week, ten-day outpatient program.

There are several things you should (and shouldn\u2019t) do to help an alcoholic.", "Understand first that you cannot \u201csave\u201d an alcoholic. Alcoholism isn\u2019t rational; you can\u2019t reason with it. It\u2019s important to understand that people who abuse alcohol can be very manipulative, and it can be hard to determine how to respond to a given situation. For example, when someone you love calls you from jail requesting bail money, it may seem that the right course of action is to hand over the funds. However, by doing this, you have paid the price for their drinking. This course of action doesn\u2019t help the alcoholic but rather prevents them from experiencing the consequences of their drinking.", "Another way you can help a loved one who is dealing with alcohol addiction in Melbourne is to talk with them about your concerns. Do so in a quiet, private setting and be honest about how you feel. Many alcoholics use denial and will often come up with reasons or excuses why their drinking isn\u2019t a problem. However, when loved ones approach the alcoholic to share some of their own issues, this can help the alcoholic realise that there is a problem and encourage them to look at things in an honest way rather than deny that the problem exists.", "You can and should also talk to other friends or family members to be sure they aren\u2019t enabling the alcoholic. Removing the enabling factor makes it harder for the alcoholic to continue drinking problematically. Attend counselling sessions together or a group such as Al-Anon to learn the best ways to help your loved one achieve alcohol addiction recovery in Melbourne. You can also offer to take your loved one to AA or similar programs where they can get some of the support and education they need.", "Taking Care of Yourself", "Whatever you do, don\u2019t blame yourself.
