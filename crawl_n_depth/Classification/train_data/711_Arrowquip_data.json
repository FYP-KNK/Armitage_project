Dimensions are important to successful use of a Box but not as critical as handler position in relation to the stock leaving the Box.

A race to a squeeze chute should hold a minimum of 4 cows and might need to hold 20 head depending on the speed of processing. Races on cow-calf operations will typically hold 5 to 6 cows. Facilities working calves or yearlings routinely need races for 12 to 20 head of cattle.", "Remember, the race will normally not be empty when additional cattle are brought through the Tub or Box. To maintain flow, it will be necessary to add additional cattle while one or two still await processing. Consequently, the length of the race is important. Ideally it would be long enough to hold an adequate number of cattle for processing while more cattle are brought through the Tub or Box - without disrupting flow. A short lead-up may result in frequent interruptions of cattle flow and processing.", "For some reason the industry has migrated toward the race starting to curve at the entrance from the Tub or Box. The exit from a Tub or a Box and entrance into the race should be straight for at least two mature cow body lengths. This allows flow to become established without the appearance of entering a dead-end race. Keep it straight for at least 12 feet and then start a curve if warranted (ex. space is limited).
