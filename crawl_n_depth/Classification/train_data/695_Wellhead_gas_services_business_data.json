In real terms,\u201d the U.S. refiners' composite cost for a barrel of crude oil averaged $14.22. Although that cost was higher than the $12.09 cost recorded in 1988, it was significantly below prices during the first half of the 1980's, prior to the 1986 plunge in crude oil prices (68).

The number of seismic crews fell to 132, down 27 percent from the number in 1988 and still dramatically below the 681 crews working in 1981 (41) when real crude oil prices peaked. Rotary rigs in operation were 869 in 1989 compared with 3,970 in 1981, and completions of exploratory wells totaled 5.2 thousand compared with 17.5 thousand in the peak year of 1981 (42).", "In contrast, the domestic refinery industry benefited from market conditions in 1989, when low crude oil prices and strong product demand tended to increase profit margins in the refining industry.

The \u201cOther\u201d sector in the Electric Utility Sales table is allocated to the Residential and Commercial Sector, except for the railways' portion of \u201cOther,\u201d which is allocated to the Transportation Sector. See Table 4.", "3. Financial Reporting System (FRS) Companies. The FRS data system is designed to permit review of the financial performance of energy companies. Data are disaggregated both by line of business and by geographic area of operation.

", "Texaco Inc. ", "Union Pacific Corporation ", "Unocal Corporation ", "USX Corporation ", "Prior to 1983, the reporting group included 26 companies. Conoco and Marathon were replaced by Du Pont and the United States Steel Corporation, due to the merger of the former companies with the latter companies, respectively, beginning in 1982. Although Occidental acquired Cities Service in 1982, separate financial reports were available for 1982, so each company continued to be treated as a separate FRS company until 1983. In 1984 three more intragroup mergers occurred: (1) Chevron acquired Gulf Oil, (2) Mobil acquired Superior Oil, and (3) Texaco acquired Getty Oil. Since financial reports for 1984 were available for the three acquired companies, they are treated as separate companies through 1984. See Tables 36 through 39 and 45.", "4. Well Completions. For the years 1970 forward, annual well completions are estimated by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) using the American Petroleum Institute's drilling data files. For more recent years, these files are not complete, due to delays in the reporting of wells drilled. Based on statistical analysis, EIA employs an adjustment process to impute missing data to show total well completions and footages for current years. See Tables 42 and 43.", "5. Reclassified. Accurate calculation of the quantity of petroleum products supplied to the domestic market is complicated by the recycling of products at the refinery, the renaming of products involved in a transfer, and the receipt of products from outside of the primary supply system. Beginning in 1981, a single adjustment (always a negative quantity) is made to total product supplied to correct this accounting problem. The calculation of this adjustment, called \u201creclassified,\u201d involves only unfinished oils and gasoline blending components. It is the sum of their net", "Annual Energy Review 1989 297", "@book{united1989annual,\n  title={Annual Energy Review},\n  author={United States.

The \u201cOther\u201d sector in the Electric Utility Sales table is allocated to the Residential and Commercial Sector, except for the railways' portion of \u201cOther,\u201d which is allocated to the Transportation Sector. See Table 4.", "3. Financial Reporting System (FRS) Companies. The FRS data system is designed to permit review of the financial performance of energy companies. Data are disaggregated both by line of business and by geographic area of operation.

Conoco and Marathon were replaced by Du Pont and the United States Steel Corporation, due to the merger of the former companies with the latter companies, respectively, beginning in 1982. Although Occidental acquired Cities Service in 1982, separate financial reports were available for 1982, so each company continued to be treated as a separate FRS company until 1983. In 1984 three more intragroup mergers occurred: (1) Chevron acquired Gulf Oil, (2) Mobil acquired Superior Oil, and (3) Texaco acquired Getty Oil. Since financial reports for 1984 were available for the three acquired companies, they are treated as separate companies through 1984. See Tables 36 through 39 and 45.", "4. Well Completions. For the years 1970 forward, annual well completions are estimated by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) using the American Petroleum Institute's drilling data files. For more recent years, these files are not complete, due to delays in the reporting of wells drilled. Based on statistical analysis, EIA employs an adjustment process to impute missing data to show total well completions and footages for current years. See Tables 42 and 43.", "5. Reclassified. Accurate calculation of the quantity of petroleum products supplied to the domestic market is complicated by the recycling of products at the refinery, the renaming of products involved in a transfer, and the receipt of products from outside of the primary supply system. Beginning in 1981, a single adjustment (always a negative quantity) is made to total product supplied to correct this accounting problem.

Fuel switching capability\" in 1985 was determined for five major energy sources: natural gas, purchased electricity, coal and coke, residual fuel oil, and distillate fuel oil (15).", "Residual fuel oil registered the largest value (43 percent) for switchable consumption as a percentage of actual consumption, indicating substantial fuel-switching capabilities. Almost 20 percent of distillate fuel oil consumption could have been supplied by other sources. It is estimated that about 92 thousand barrels per day of fuel oil consumption could have been switched to nonpetroleum sources.", "*The manufacturing sector is composed of establishments that use mechanical or chemical processes to transform raw materials into intermediate or final products. It does not include the remainder of the industrial sector (construction, mining, agricultural, fishing, and forestry establishments) or electric utilities. The 17.5 quadrillion Btu total is ", "primary ", "energy ", "consumption; ", "it includes energy consumed to produce heat and ", "power ", "and to generate electricity, as well as sources of energy consumed as petrochemical feedstocks and raw material inputs, but it excludes byproduct fuels.", "\u201cNet electricity, which is obtained by summing purchases, transfers in, and generation from noncombustible renewable resources, minus quantities sold and transferred out. It excludes electricity generated from combustible fuels, which are counted as generating fuels.", "*The capability of U.S. manufacturers to switch fuels within 30 days, using only existing equipment and keeping production output constant.", "Annual Energy Review 1989", "Natural gas registered the largest absolute amount of total switchable consumption. Of the 4.7 quadrillion Btu total of natural gas consumption, 2.0 quadrillion Btu (42 percent) could have been switched to other sources. Of the 1.8 quadrillion Btu of coal and coke consumed, 0.5 quadrillion Btu (30 percent) were switchable. Very little of the 2.2 quadrillion Btu of purchased electricity consumed by manufacturers in 1985 could have been switched to other sources\u2014less than 2 percent if manufacturing output were to be maintained.", "Trends in Industrial Energy Consumption", "Energy consumption by the industrial sector increased throughout the 1960's and attained an all-time high in 1973 of 26 quadrillion Btu (11). After 1973, increasing energy prices tended to depress industrial sector demand for energy, and the rate of consumption trended downward. By 1986, the annual total was 20 quadrillion Btu. Following the 1986 fall in crude oil prices, industrial energy consumption rose to 22 quadrillion Btu in 1989.", "The industrial sector relied on the three major fossil fuels\u2014petroleum, natural gas, and coal\u2014and electricity throughout the 1960-to-1989 period, but the relative contributions of each form of energy changed over time. Coal, which accounted for a 26-percent share in 1960, provided only 13 percent of industrial energy in 1989. Meanwhile, electricity's share rose from 7 percent to 14 percent.", "During the 30-year period, the share supplied by petroleum ranged from 33 percent to 41 percent, and the share supplied by natural gas ranged from 33 percent to 42 percent. In 1989, petroleum and natural gas accounted for equal shares, 37 percent each, and electricity and coal accounted for 14-percent and 13-percent shares, respectively.", "One measure of energy efficiency in the industrial sector is the ratio of end-use energy consumption to industrial output (measured in thousand Btu per 1982 dollar). Throughout the 1960-to-1973 period, when energy was relatively cheap and supplies were assured, energy consumption per dollar of industrial output stayed within a narrow range, with a low of 11.5 in 1968 and a high of 12.4 in 1970 (12). After 1973, the measure began to decline, and by 1985 (the most recent year for which data are available) had fallen to 8.7 thousand Btu per 1982 dollar of industrial output, 29 percent below the peak in 1970.", "21", "Figure 7.

Conoco and Marathon were replaced by Du Pont and the United States Steel Corporation, due to the merger of the former companies with the latter companies, respectively, beginning in 1982. Although Occidental acquired Cities Service in 1982, separate financial reports were available for 1982, so each company continued to be treated as a separate FRS company until 1983. In 1984 three more intragroup mergers occurred: (1) Chevron acquired Gulf Oil, (2) Mobil acquired Superior Oil, and (3) Texaco acquired Getty Oil. Since financial reports for 1984 were available for the three acquired companies, they are treated as separate companies through 1984. See Tables 36 through 39 and 45.", "4. Well Completions. For the years 1970 forward, annual well completions are estimated by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) using the American Petroleum Institute's drilling data files. For more recent years, these files are not complete, due to delays in the reporting of wells drilled. Based on statistical analysis, EIA employs an adjustment process to impute missing data to show total well completions and footages for current years. See Tables 42 and 43.", "5. Reclassified. Accurate calculation of the quantity of petroleum products supplied to the domestic market is complicated by the recycling of products at the refinery, the renaming of products involved in a transfer, and the receipt of products from outside of the primary supply system. Beginning in 1981, a single adjustment (always a negative quantity) is made to total product supplied to correct this accounting problem. The calculation of this adjustment, called \u201creclassified,\u201d involves only unfinished oils and gasoline blending components.

See Tables 57, 60, and 62.", "6. Gross Input to Distillation Units (GIDU). The methods for deriving GIDU in this report are as follows: 1949 through 1966 GIDU is estimated by summing annual crude oil runs to stills, net unfinished oil reruns at refineries and shipments of natural gasoline and plant condensate from natural gas processing plants to refineries. 1967 through 1973 GIDU is estimated by summing annual crude oil runs to stills, net unfinished oil reruns, and refinery input of natural gasoline and plant condensate. 1974 through 1980 GIDU is published annual data. 1981 and forward GIDU is the sum of reported monthly data. See Table 58.", "7. Petroleum Products Supplied. Total petroleum products supplied is the sum of the product supplied for each petroleum product, crude oil, unfinished oils, and gasoline blending components. For each of these, except crude oil, product supplied is calculated by adding refinery production, natural gas plant liquids production, new supply of other liquids, imports, stock withdrawals, and subtracting stock additions, refinery inputs, and exports. Crude oil product supplied is the sum of crude oil burned on leases and at pipeline pump stations as reported on Form EIA-813. Prior to 1983, crude oil burned on leases and at pipeline pump stations was reported as either distillate or residual fuel oil and was included as product supplied for these products. Petroleum product supplied is an approximation of petroleum consumption and is synonymous with the term \u201cPetroleum Consumption\u201d in Section 1. Sector data for petroleum products used in more than one sector are derived from surveys of sales to ultimate consumers by refiners, marketers, distributors, and dealers and from receipts at electric utilities. See Explanatory Notes 5 and 8 and Tables 60, 61, and 62.", "8. Joint Petroleum Reporting System. Beginning in January 1981, several Energy Information Administration survey forms and calculation methodologies were changed to reflect new developments in refinery and blending plant practices and to improve data integrity. These changes affect production and product supplied statistics for motor gasoline, distillate fuel oil, and residual fuel oil, and stocks of motor gasoline. On the new basis, motor gasoline production during the last half of 1980 would have averaged 289,000 barrels per day higher than that which was published on the old basis. Distillate and residual fuel oil production and product supplied for all of 1980 would have averaged, respectively, 105,000 and 54,000 barrels per day higher than the numbers that were published. See Tables 57, 60, and 62.", "9. Crude Oil Wellhead Prices. Derived as follows: 1949 through 1973\u2013 weighted average wellhead values as reported by State agencies and calculated by the Bureau of Mines; 1974 and 1975\u2014weighted averages of a sample survey of major first purchasers' purchases; 1976 and forward\u2014weighted averages of all first purchasers' purchases. See Table 65.", "10. Refiner. Acquisition Cost of Crude Oil. This cost was estimated for 1968 through 1973. The cost of domestic crude oil was derived by adding estimated transportation costs to the reported average wellhead value. The cost of imported crude oils was derived by adding an estimated ocean transport cost based on the published \u201cAverage Freight Rate Assessment\u201d to the average \u201cFree Alongside Ship\u201d value published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. The composite cost was derived by weighting domestic costs and imported costs based on quantities produced and imported. See Table 68.", "11. Natural Gas Consumption. Natural gas consumption statistics are compiled from a survey of natural gas production, transmission, and distribution companies and electric utility companies. Consumption by sector from these surveys is compiled on a national and individual State basis and then balanced with national and individual State supply data. Included in the data are the following: Commercial Sector\u2014 consumption by nonmanufacturing establishments, by municipalities for institutional heating and lighting, and those engaged in agriculture, forestry, and fishing; Electric Utility Sector\u2014consumption by electric utilities for the generation of electric power; Industrial Sector\u2014 consumption by establishments engaged primarily in processing unfinished materials into another form of product (includes mining, petroleum refining, manufacturing, and natural gas industry use for lease and plant fuel); Residential Sector\u2014consumption by private households for space heating, cooking, and other household uses; Transportation Sector\u2014 natural gas transmission (pipeline) fuel. See Tables 75 and 78.", "12. Natural Gas Prices by National Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) Categories. Old Gas. Includes natural gas dedicated to interstate commerce and natural gas purchased under existing interstate or rollover contracts (Section NGPA 104, 105, and 106). New Gas. Includes new natural gas and certain natural gas produced from the Outer Continental Shelf, stripper well gas, and other new gas categories (Section NGPA 102, 103, 108, and 109). High-Cost Gas. Includes natural gas from deep wells and low permeability (tight) reservoirs and unregulated gas (NGPA Section 107). See Table 77.", "298 Annual Energy Review 1989", "13. Coal Consumption. Data in this report on the consumption of bituminous coal (including subbituminous coal), lignite, and anthracite are generated primarily from consumption data reported in surveys. Included are data reported by all electric utility companies and coke plant companies. Data on coal consumption by all industrial and manufacturing establishments and by the residential and commercial sector are based on distribution data obtained quarterly from coal companies. Included in sector data are the following: Electric Utility Sector\u2014 consumption by privately and publicly owned establishments engaged in the generation and/or distribution of electric power primarily for sale or resale; Industrial and Miscellaneous Sector\u2014consumption at manufacturing plants, large commercial establishments, coking plants, and by agriculture, mining (other than coal mining) and construction industries; Transportation Sector\u2014sales to railroads and vessel bunker fuel; Residential and Commercial Sector\u2014retail dealer sales to households and small commercial establishments. See Table 81.", "14. Electricity Statistics. Prior to 1985, electricity supply and distribution statistics included data reported by institutions (such as universities) and military facilities that generated electricity primarily for their own use. Beginning in 1985, electricity statistics exclude data for these facilities and include only data for those organizations that generate electricity primarily for public use. See Tables 87 through 94.", "15. Electrical System Energy Losses. Electrical system energy losses are calculated as the difference between total energy input at electric utilities and the total energy content of electricity sold to end-use consumers. Most of these losses occur at steam electric power plants (conventional and nuclear) in the conversion of heat energy into mechanical energy to turn electric generators. This loss is a thermodynamically necessary feature of the steam electric cycle. Part of the energy input to output losses are a result of imputing fossil energy equivalent inputs for hydroelectric and other energy sources, since there is no generally accepted practice for measuring these thermal conversion rates. In addition to conversion losses, other losses include power plant use of electricity, transmission and distribution of electricity from power plants to end-use consumers (also called \u201cline-losses\u201d), and unaccounted for electricity. Total losses are allocated to the end-use sectors in proportion to each sector's share of total electricity sales. Overall, approximately 67 percent of total energy input is lost in conversion; of electricity generated, approximately 5 percent is lost in plant use and 9 percent in transmission and distribution. Calculated electrical energy system losses may be less than actual losses, because primary consumption does not include the energy equivalent of utility purchases of electricity from nonutilities and from Canada and Mexico, although they are included in electricity sales. See Table 90.", "16. Electricity Sales. Data on the sales of electric utility electricity represent gross electricity output measured at the generator terminals, minus power plant use and transmission and distribution losses. Included in each end-use sector are the following: Commercial Sector\u2014sales of electricity to businesses that generally require less than 1,000 kilowatts of service; Industrial Sector\u2014sales of electricity to businesses that generally require more than 1,000 kilowatts of service; Residential Sector\u2014sales of electricity to residences for household purposes; \u201cOther\u201d Sector\u2014sales of electricity to Government, railways, street lighting authorities, and sales not elsewhere included. See Table 92.", "17. Net Summer Capability. Net summer capabilities were first collected on Form EIA-860 for the 1984 data year. Units not assigned a net summer capability rating by the utility were given an estimated rating using a statistical relationship between installed nameplate capacity and net summer capability for each prime mover. To estimate net summer capability from 1949 through 1984, two methods were used. For each prime mover except nuclear and \u201cother,\u201d net summer capability estimates were calculated in two steps. First, the unit capacity values reported on Form EIA-860 and the unit start dates contained in the 1984 Generating Unit Reference File (GURF) were used to compute preliminary aggregate estimates of annual net summer capability and installed nameplate capacity. These preliminary estimates were obtained by aggregating unit capacity values for all units in service during a given year. Next, the ratio of the preliminary capability to nameplate estimate was computed for each year and multiplied by the previously published installed nameplate capacity values to produce the final estimates of net summer capability.", "The net summer capability data for nuclear and \u201cother\u201d units were used directly from the 1984 GURF for all years. Historical aggregates were then developed using the unit start dates on the GURF.", "Historical capacity has also been modified to estimate capability based upon the operable definition. This was accomplished by assuming that nonnuclear generating units became operable between 1 and 4 months prior to their commercial operation dates, depending upon the prime mover and time period. The actual operable dates for nuclear units were used. See Tables 93 and 97.", "18. Operable Units. Prior to 1973, the number of \u201cOperable Units at End of Year\u201d includes units that were in commercial operation by December 31 of the stated year. Units decommissioned or inoperative for extended periods were generally included. Also included are two U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-operated plants that supply electricity to the", "\ncommercial grid. A third DOE plant, which does not distribute electricity to the grid, is excluded. For 1973 and forward, the number of units includes units issued full-power or operating licenses and generally does not include units in long-term shutdown status. See Table 97.", "\nmaximum possible generation for that month. The maximum possible generation is the number of hours in the month multiplied by the net monthly maximum dependable capacity. This fraction is then multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage.", "Annual Energy Review 1989 299", "\n300 Annual Energy Review 1989", "\n302 Annual Energy Review 1989", "19. World Primary Energy Production. Includes only crude oil and lease condensate, natural gas plant liquids, dry natural gas, coal, and electricity from hydroelectric power and nuclear power. Crude oil production is measured at the wellhead and includes lease condensate. Natural gas plant liquids are products obtained from processing natural gas at natural gas processing plants, including natural gas plants, cycling plants, and fractionators. Dry natural gas production is that amount of natural gas production that is available to be marketed and consumed as a gas. Coal (anthracite, subanthracite, bituminous, subbituminous, lignite, and brown coal) production is the sum of sales, mine consumption, issues to miners, and issues to coking, briquetting, and other ancillary plants at mines. Coal production data include quantities extracted from surface and underground workings and normally exclude wastes removed at mines or associated preparation plants. The production of electricity from hydroelectric power and nuclear power includes both electric utility and", "industrial production reported on a net basis, thus excluding electricity that is generally used by the electric power plant for its own operating purposes or electricity losses in the transformers that are considered integral parts of the station. See Tables 105 and 106.", "20. Primary Stocks of Petroleum\u2014OECD. Petroleum stocks reported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) include those held at (or in) the following locations or facilities: leases, refineries, natural gas processing plants, bulk terminals, tanks associated with pipelines, barges, intercoastal tankers, ocean tankers in port, inland ship bunkers, major final consumers, and the strategic storage reserve. For an individual country, stocks include those held for the account of that country but located in another country. U.S. stocks include those held in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. \u201cOther OECD\u2019\u201d includes stocks held in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The OECD definition of petroleum stocks excludes petroleum in pipelines, rail tank cars, tank trucks, oceangoing ship bunkers, service stations, retail stores, and tankers at sea. An exception is U.S. stocks which include petroleum in pipelines. See Table 113.", "Class A Electric Utility: An electric utility having annual electric operating revenues of $2.5 million or more during the previous calendar year.

Together, the two industries accounted for half of the primary energy consumption in the manufacturing sector.", "Because the manufacturing sector accounts for a large share of total U.S. energy consumption, manufacturers' ability to cope with fluctuations in energy supplies and prices by switching to alternative sources of energy plays a significant role in the Nation's energy security.

The methods for deriving GIDU in this report are as follows: 1949 through 1966 GIDU is estimated by summing annual crude oil runs to stills, net unfinished oil reruns at refineries and shipments of natural gasoline and plant condensate from natural gas processing plants to refineries. 1967 through 1973 GIDU is estimated by summing annual crude oil runs to stills, net unfinished oil reruns, and refinery input of natural gasoline and plant condensate. 1974 through 1980 GIDU is published annual data. 1981 and forward GIDU is the sum of reported monthly data. See Table 58.", "7. Petroleum Products Supplied. Total petroleum products supplied is the sum of the product supplied for each petroleum product, crude oil, unfinished oils, and gasoline blending components. For each of these, except crude oil, product supplied is calculated by adding refinery production, natural gas plant liquids production, new supply of other liquids, imports, stock withdrawals, and subtracting stock additions, refinery inputs, and exports. Crude oil product supplied is the sum of crude oil burned on leases and at pipeline pump stations as reported on Form EIA-813. Prior to 1983, crude oil burned on leases and at pipeline pump stations was reported as either distillate or residual fuel oil and was included as product supplied for these products. Petroleum product supplied is an approximation of petroleum consumption and is synonymous with the term \u201cPetroleum Consumption\u201d in Section 1. Sector data for petroleum products used in more than one sector are derived from surveys of sales to ultimate consumers by refiners, marketers, distributors, and dealers and from receipts at electric utilities. See Explanatory Notes 5 and 8 and Tables 60, 61, and 62.", "8. Joint Petroleum Reporting System. Beginning in January 1981, several Energy Information Administration survey forms and calculation methodologies were changed to reflect new developments in refinery and blending plant practices and to improve data integrity. These changes affect production and product supplied statistics for motor gasoline, distillate fuel oil, and residual fuel oil, and stocks of motor gasoline. On the new basis, motor gasoline production during the last half of 1980 would have averaged 289,000 barrels per day higher than that which was published on the old basis. Distillate and residual fuel oil production and product supplied for all of 1980 would have averaged, respectively, 105,000 and 54,000 barrels per day higher than the numbers that were published. See Tables 57, 60, and 62.", "9. Crude Oil Wellhead Prices. Derived as follows: 1949 through 1973\u2013 weighted average wellhead values as reported by State agencies and calculated by the Bureau of Mines; 1974 and 1975\u2014weighted averages of a sample survey of major first purchasers' purchases; 1976 and forward\u2014weighted averages of all first purchasers' purchases. See Table 65.", "10. Refiner. Acquisition Cost of Crude Oil. This cost was estimated for 1968 through 1973. The cost of domestic crude oil was derived by adding estimated transportation costs to the reported average wellhead value. The cost of imported crude oils was derived by adding an estimated ocean transport cost based on the published \u201cAverage Freight Rate Assessment\u201d to the average \u201cFree Alongside Ship\u201d value published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. The composite cost was derived by weighting domestic costs and imported costs based on quantities produced and imported. See Table 68.", "11. Natural Gas Consumption. Natural gas consumption statistics are compiled from a survey of natural gas production, transmission, and distribution companies and electric utility companies. Consumption by sector from these surveys is compiled on a national and individual State basis and then balanced with national and individual State supply data.

See Tables 75 and 78.", "12. Natural Gas Prices by National Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) Categories. Old Gas. Includes natural gas dedicated to interstate commerce and natural gas purchased under existing interstate or rollover contracts (Section NGPA 104, 105, and 106). New Gas. Includes new natural gas and certain natural gas produced from the Outer Continental Shelf, stripper well gas, and other new gas categories (Section NGPA 102, 103, 108, and 109). High-Cost Gas. Includes natural gas from deep wells and low permeability (tight) reservoirs and unregulated gas (NGPA Section 107). See Table 77.", "298 Annual Energy Review 1989", "13. Coal Consumption. Data in this report on the consumption of bituminous coal (including subbituminous coal), lignite, and anthracite are generated primarily from consumption data reported in surveys. Included are data reported by all electric utility companies and coke plant companies. Data on coal consumption by all industrial and manufacturing establishments and by the residential and commercial sector are based on distribution data obtained quarterly from coal companies. Included in sector data are the following: Electric Utility Sector\u2014 consumption by privately and publicly ", "owned establishments ", "engaged in the generation and/or distribution of electric ", "power ", "primarily for sale or resale; Industrial and Miscellaneous Sector\u2014consumption at manufacturing plants, large commercial establishments, coking plants, and by agriculture, mining (other than coal mining) and construction industries; Transportation Sector\u2014sales to railroads and vessel bunker fuel; Residential and Commercial Sector\u2014retail dealer sales to households and small commercial establishments. See Table 81.", "14. Electricity Statistics. Prior to 1985, electricity supply and distribution statistics included data reported by institutions (such as universities) and military facilities that generated electricity primarily for their own use. Beginning in 1985, electricity statistics exclude data for these facilities and include only data for those organizations that generate electricity primarily for public use. See Tables 87 through 94.", "15. Electrical System Energy Losses. Electrical system energy losses are calculated as the difference between total energy input at electric utilities and the total energy content of electricity ", "sold to end-use ", "consumers. Most of these losses occur at steam electric ", "power ", "plants (conventional and nuclear) in the conversion of heat energy into mechanical energy to turn electric generators. This loss is a thermodynamically necessary feature of the steam electric cycle. Part of the energy input to output losses are a result of imputing fossil energy equivalent inputs for hydroelectric and other energy sources, since there is no generally accepted practice for measuring these thermal conversion rates. In addition to conversion losses, other losses include ", "power plant ", "use of electricity, transmission and distribution of electricity from ", "power ", "plants to end-use consumers (also called \u201cline-losses\u201d), and unaccounted for electricity. Total losses are allocated to the end-use sectors in proportion to each sector's share of total electricity sales. Overall, approximately 67 percent of total energy input is lost in conversion; of electricity generated, approximately 5 percent is lost in plant use and 9 percent in transmission and distribution. Calculated electrical energy system losses may be less than actual losses, because primary consumption does not include the energy equivalent of utility purchases of electricity from nonutilities and from Canada and Mexico, although they are included in electricity sales. See Table 90.", "16. Electricity Sales. Data on the sales of electric utility electricity represent gross electricity output measured at the generator terminals, minus ", "power ", "plant use and transmission and distribution losses. Included in each end-use sector are the following: Commercial Sector\u2014sales of electricity to businesses that generally require less than 1,000 kilowatts of service; Industrial Sector\u2014sales of electricity to businesses that generally require more than 1,000 kilowatts of service; Residential Sector\u2014sales of electricity to residences for household purposes; \u201cOther\u201d Sector\u2014sales of electricity to Government, railways, street lighting authorities, and sales not elsewhere included. See Table 92.", "17. Net Summer Capability. Net summer capabilities were first collected on Form EIA-860 for the 1984 data year. Units not assigned a net summer capability rating by the utility were given an estimated rating using a statistical relationship between installed nameplate capacity and net summer capability for each prime mover. To estimate net summer capability from 1949 through 1984, two methods were used. For each prime mover except nuclear and \u201cother,\u201d net summer capability estimates were calculated in two steps. First, the unit capacity values reported on Form EIA-860 and the unit start dates contained in the 1984 Generating Unit Reference File (GURF) were used to compute preliminary aggregate estimates of annual net summer capability and installed nameplate capacity. These preliminary estimates were obtained by aggregating unit capacity values for all units in service during a given year. Next, the ratio of the preliminary capability to nameplate estimate was computed for each year and multiplied by the previously published installed nameplate capacity values to produce the final estimates of net summer capability.", "The net summer capability data for nuclear and \u201cother\u201d units were used directly from the 1984 GURF for all years. Historical aggregates were then developed using the unit start dates on the GURF.", "Historical capacity has also been modified to estimate capability based upon the operable definition. This was accomplished by assuming that nonnuclear generating units became operable between 1 and 4 months prior to their commercial operation dates, depending upon the prime mover and time period. The actual operable dates for nuclear units were used. See Tables 93 and 97.", "18. Operable Units. Prior to 1973, the number of \u201cOperable Units at End of Year\u201d includes units that were in commercial operation by December 31 of the stated year. Units decommissioned or inoperative for extended periods were generally included. Also included are two U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-operated plants that supply electricity to the", "\ncommercial grid. A third DOE plant, which does not distribute electricity to the grid, is excluded.

Natural gas plant liquids are products obtained from processing natural gas at natural gas processing plants, including natural gas plants, cycling plants, and fractionators. Dry natural gas production is that amount of natural gas production that is available to be marketed and consumed as a gas. Coal (anthracite, subanthracite, bituminous, subbituminous, lignite, and brown coal) production is the sum of sales, mine consumption, issues to miners, and issues to coking, briquetting, and other ancillary plants at mines.

Data on the generation of electricity in the United States represents gross electricity output measured at the generator terminals, minus power plant use (net electricity generated). Nuclear electricity generation data identified by individual countries in this report are gross electricity output. See Tables 2, 87, 88, 89, 120, and 121.", "2. Consumption of Primary Energy by End-Use Sector. Sector data are derived from the end-use sector table of each energy commodity. The \u201cOther\u201d sector in the Electric Utility Sales table is allocated to the Residential and Commercial Sector, except for the railways' portion of \u201cOther,\u201d which is allocated to the Transportation Sector. See Table 4.", "3. Financial Reporting System (FRS) Companies. The FRS data system is designed to permit review of the financial performance of energy companies. Data are disaggregated both by line of business and by geographic area of operation. Domestic operations include Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; foreign operations exclude those areas.", "The 23 companies included in the FRS for the 1988 reporting year are the following:", "Amerada Hess Corporation ", "American Petrofina Inc. ", "Amoco Corporation ", "Ashland Oil Inc. ", "Atlantic Richfield Company ", "BP America Inc. ", "Burlington Resources Inc. ", "Chevron Corporation ", "Coastal Corporation ", "E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (Du Pont) ", "Exxon Corporation ", "Kerr-McGee Corporation ", "Mobil Corporation ", "Occidental Petroleum Corporation ", "Oryx Energy Company ", "Phillips Petroleum Company ", "Shell Oil Company ", "Sun Company ", "Tenneco Inc. ", "Texaco Inc. ", "Union Pacific Corporation ", "Unocal Corporation ", "USX Corporation ", "Prior to 1983, the reporting group included 26 companies. Conoco and Marathon were replaced by Du Pont and the United States Steel Corporation, due to the merger of the former companies with the latter companies, respectively, beginning in 1982. Although Occidental acquired Cities Service in 1982, separate financial reports were available for 1982, so each company continued to be treated as a separate FRS company until 1983. In 1984 three more intragroup mergers occurred: (1) Chevron acquired Gulf Oil, (2) Mobil acquired Superior Oil, and (3) Texaco acquired Getty Oil. Since financial reports for 1984 were available for the three acquired companies, they are treated as separate companies through 1984. See Tables 36 through 39 and 45.", "4. Well Completions. For the years 1970 forward, annual well completions are estimated by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) using the American Petroleum Institute's drilling data files. For more recent years, these files are not complete, due to delays in the reporting of wells drilled. Based on statistical analysis, EIA employs an adjustment process to impute missing data to show total well completions and footages for current years. See Tables 42 and 43.", "5. Reclassified. Accurate calculation of the quantity of petroleum products supplied to the domestic market is complicated by the recycling of products at the refinery, the renaming of products involved in a transfer, and the receipt of products from outside of the primary supply system. Beginning in 1981, a single adjustment (always a negative quantity) is made to total product supplied to correct this accounting problem. The calculation of this adjustment, called \u201creclassified,\u201d involves only unfinished oils and gasoline blending components. It is the sum of their net", "Annual Energy Review 1989 297", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "My library", "Books on Google Play", "Figure 104.

The \u201cOther\u201d sector in the Electric Utility Sales table is allocated to the Residential and Commercial Sector, except for the railways' portion of \u201cOther,\u201d which is allocated to the Transportation Sector. See Table 4.", "3. Financial Reporting System (FRS) Companies. The FRS data system is designed to permit review of the financial performance of energy companies.

", "Texaco Inc. ", "Union Pacific Corporation ", "Unocal Corporation ", "USX Corporation ", "Prior to 1983, the reporting group included 26 companies. Conoco and Marathon were replaced by Du Pont and the United States Steel Corporation, due to the merger of the former companies with the latter companies, respectively, beginning in 1982. Although Occidental acquired Cities Service in 1982, separate financial reports were available for 1982, so each company continued to be treated as a separate FRS company until 1983. In 1984 three more intragroup mergers occurred: (1) Chevron acquired Gulf Oil, (2) Mobil acquired Superior Oil, and (3) Texaco acquired Getty Oil. Since financial reports for 1984 were available for the three acquired companies, they are treated as separate companies through 1984. See Tables 36 through 39 and 45.", "4. Well Completions. For the years 1970 forward, annual well completions are estimated by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) using the American Petroleum Institute's drilling data files. For more recent years, these files are not complete, due to delays in the reporting of wells drilled. Based on statistical analysis, EIA employs an adjustment process to impute missing data to show total well completions and footages for current years. See Tables 42 and 43.", "5. Reclassified. Accurate calculation of the quantity of petroleum products supplied to the domestic market is complicated by the recycling of products at the refinery, the renaming of products involved in a transfer, and the receipt of products from outside of the primary supply system. Beginning in 1981, a single adjustment (always a negative quantity) is made to total product supplied to correct this accounting problem. The calculation of this adjustment, called \u201creclassified,\u201d involves only unfinished oils and gasoline blending components.

See Tables 57, 60, and 62.", "6. Gross Input to Distillation Units (GIDU). The methods for deriving GIDU in this report are as follows: 1949 through 1966 GIDU is estimated by summing annual crude oil runs to stills, net unfinished oil reruns at refineries and shipments of natural gasoline and plant condensate from natural gas processing plants to refineries. 1967 through 1973 GIDU is estimated by summing annual crude oil runs to stills, net unfinished oil reruns, and refinery input of natural gasoline and plant condensate. 1974 through 1980 GIDU is published annual data. 1981 and forward GIDU is the sum of reported monthly data. See Table 58.", "7. Petroleum Products Supplied. Total petroleum products supplied is the sum of the product supplied for each petroleum product, crude oil, unfinished oils, and gasoline blending components. For each of these, except crude oil, product supplied is calculated by adding refinery production, natural gas plant liquids production, new supply of other liquids, imports, stock withdrawals, and subtracting stock additions, refinery inputs, and exports. Crude oil product supplied is the sum of crude oil burned on leases and at pipeline pump stations as reported on Form EIA-813. Prior to 1983, crude oil burned on leases and at pipeline pump stations was reported as either distillate or residual fuel oil and was included as product supplied for these products. Petroleum product supplied is an approximation of petroleum consumption and is synonymous with the term \u201cPetroleum Consumption\u201d in Section 1. Sector data for petroleum products used in more than one sector are derived from surveys of sales to ultimate consumers by refiners, marketers, distributors, and dealers and from receipts at electric utilities. See Explanatory Notes 5 and 8 and Tables 60, 61, and 62.", "8. Joint Petroleum Reporting System. Beginning in January 1981, several Energy Information Administration survey forms and calculation methodologies were changed to reflect new developments in refinery and blending plant practices and to improve data integrity. These changes affect production and product supplied statistics for motor gasoline, distillate fuel oil, and residual fuel oil, and stocks of motor gasoline. On the new basis, motor gasoline production during the last half of 1980 would have averaged 289,000 barrels per day higher than that which was published on the old basis. Distillate and residual fuel oil production and product supplied for all of 1980 would have averaged, respectively, 105,000 and 54,000 barrels per day higher than the numbers that were published. See Tables 57, 60, and 62.", "9. Crude Oil Wellhead Prices. Derived as follows: 1949 through 1973\u2013 weighted average wellhead values as reported by State agencies and calculated by the Bureau of Mines; 1974 and 1975\u2014weighted averages of a sample survey of major first purchasers' purchases; 1976 and forward\u2014weighted averages of all first purchasers' purchases. See Table 65.", "10. Refiner. Acquisition Cost of Crude Oil. This cost was estimated for 1968 through 1973. The cost of domestic crude oil was derived by adding estimated transportation costs to the reported average wellhead value. The cost of imported crude oils was derived by adding an estimated ocean transport cost based on the published \u201cAverage Freight Rate Assessment\u201d to the average \u201cFree Alongside Ship\u201d value published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. The composite cost was derived by weighting domestic costs and imported costs based on quantities produced and imported. See Table 68.", "11. Natural Gas Consumption. Natural gas consumption statistics are compiled from a survey of natural gas production, transmission, and distribution companies and electric utility companies. Consumption by sector from these surveys is compiled on a national and individual State basis and then balanced with national and individual State supply data. Included in the data are the following: Commercial Sector\u2014 consumption by nonmanufacturing establishments, by municipalities for institutional heating and lighting, and those engaged in agriculture, forestry, and fishing; Electric Utility Sector\u2014consumption by electric utilities for the generation of electric power; Industrial Sector\u2014 consumption by establishments engaged primarily in processing unfinished materials into another form of product (includes mining, petroleum refining, manufacturing, and natural gas industry use for lease and plant fuel); Residential Sector\u2014consumption by private households for space heating, cooking, and other household uses; Transportation Sector\u2014 natural gas transmission (pipeline) fuel. See Tables 75 and 78.", "12. Natural Gas Prices by National Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) Categories. Old Gas. Includes natural gas dedicated to interstate commerce and natural gas purchased under existing interstate or rollover contracts (Section NGPA 104, 105, and 106). New Gas. Includes new natural gas and certain natural gas produced from the Outer Continental Shelf, stripper well gas, and other new gas categories (Section NGPA 102, 103, 108, and 109). High-Cost Gas. Includes natural gas from deep wells and low permeability (tight) reservoirs and unregulated gas (NGPA Section 107). See Table 77.", "298 Annual Energy Review 1989", "13. Coal Consumption. Data in this report on the consumption of bituminous coal (including subbituminous coal), lignite, and anthracite are generated primarily from consumption data reported in surveys. Included are data reported by all electric utility companies and coke plant companies. Data on coal consumption by all industrial and manufacturing establishments and by the residential and commercial sector are based on distribution data obtained quarterly from coal companies. Included in sector data are the following: Electric Utility Sector\u2014 consumption by privately and publicly owned establishments engaged in the generation and/or distribution of electric power primarily for sale or resale; Industrial and Miscellaneous Sector\u2014consumption at manufacturing plants, large commercial establishments, coking plants, and by agriculture, mining (other than coal mining) and construction industries; Transportation Sector\u2014sales to railroads and vessel bunker fuel; Residential and Commercial Sector\u2014retail dealer sales to households and small commercial establishments. See Table 81.", "14. Electricity Statistics. Prior to 1985, electricity supply and distribution statistics included data reported by institutions (such as universities) and military facilities that generated electricity primarily for their own use. Beginning in 1985, electricity statistics exclude data for these facilities and include only data for those organizations that generate electricity primarily for public use. See Tables 87 through 94.", "15. Electrical System Energy Losses. Electrical system energy losses are calculated as the difference between total energy input at electric utilities and the total energy content of electricity sold to end-use consumers. Most of these losses occur at steam electric power plants (conventional and nuclear) in the conversion of heat energy into mechanical energy to turn electric generators. This loss is a thermodynamically necessary feature of the steam electric cycle. Part of the energy input to output losses are a result of imputing fossil energy equivalent inputs for hydroelectric and other energy sources, since there is no generally accepted practice for measuring these thermal conversion rates. In addition to conversion losses, other losses include power plant use of electricity, transmission and distribution of electricity from power plants to end-use consumers (also called \u201cline-losses\u201d), and unaccounted for electricity. Total losses are allocated to the end-use sectors in proportion to each sector's share of total electricity sales. Overall, approximately 67 percent of total energy input is lost in conversion; of electricity generated, approximately 5 percent is lost in plant use and 9 percent in transmission and distribution. Calculated electrical energy system losses may be less than actual losses, because primary consumption does not include the energy equivalent of utility purchases of electricity from nonutilities and from Canada and Mexico, although they are included in electricity sales. See Table 90.", "16. Electricity Sales. Data on the sales of electric utility electricity represent gross electricity output measured at the generator terminals, minus power plant use and transmission and distribution losses. Included in each end-use sector are the following: Commercial Sector\u2014sales of electricity to businesses that generally require less than 1,000 kilowatts of service; Industrial Sector\u2014sales of electricity to businesses that generally require more than 1,000 kilowatts of service; Residential Sector\u2014sales of electricity to residences for household purposes; \u201cOther\u201d Sector\u2014sales of electricity to Government, railways, street lighting authorities, and sales not elsewhere included. See Table 92.", "17. Net Summer Capability. Net summer capabilities were first collected on Form EIA-860 for the 1984 data year. Units not assigned a net summer capability rating by the utility were given an estimated rating using a statistical relationship between installed nameplate capacity and net summer capability for each prime mover. To estimate net summer capability from 1949 through 1984, two methods were used. For each prime mover except nuclear and \u201cother,\u201d net summer capability estimates were calculated in two steps. First, the unit capacity values reported on Form EIA-860 and the unit start dates contained in the 1984 Generating Unit Reference File (GURF) were used to compute preliminary aggregate estimates of annual net summer capability and installed nameplate capacity. These preliminary estimates were obtained by aggregating unit capacity values for all units in service during a given year. Next, the ratio of the preliminary capability to nameplate estimate was computed for each year and multiplied by the previously published installed nameplate capacity values to produce the final estimates of net summer capability.", "The net summer capability data for nuclear and \u201cother\u201d units were used directly from the 1984 GURF for all years. Historical aggregates were then developed using the unit start dates on the GURF.", "Historical capacity has also been modified to estimate capability based upon the operable definition. This was accomplished by assuming that nonnuclear generating units became operable between 1 and 4 months prior to their commercial operation dates, depending upon the prime mover and time period. The actual operable dates for nuclear units were used. See Tables 93 and 97.", "18. Operable Units. Prior to 1973, the number of \u201cOperable Units at End of Year\u201d includes units that were in commercial operation by December 31 of the stated year. Units decommissioned or inoperative for extended periods were generally included. Also included are two U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-operated plants that supply electricity to the", "\ncommercial grid. A third DOE plant, which does not distribute electricity to the grid, is excluded. For 1973 and forward, the number of units includes units issued full-power or operating licenses and generally does not include units in long-term shutdown status. See Table 97.", "\nmaximum possible generation for that month. The maximum possible generation is the number of hours in the month multiplied by the net monthly maximum dependable capacity. This fraction is then multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage.", "Annual Energy Review 1989 299", "\n300 Annual Energy Review 1989", "\n302 Annual Energy Review 1989", "19. World Primary Energy Production. Includes only crude oil and lease condensate, natural gas plant liquids, dry natural gas, coal, and electricity from hydroelectric power and nuclear power. Crude oil production is measured at the wellhead and includes lease condensate. Natural gas plant liquids are products obtained from processing natural gas at natural gas processing plants, including natural gas plants, cycling plants, and fractionators. Dry natural gas production is that amount of natural gas production that is available to be marketed and consumed as a gas. Coal (anthracite, subanthracite, bituminous, subbituminous, lignite, and brown coal) production is the sum of sales, mine consumption, issues to miners, and issues to coking, briquetting, and other ancillary plants at mines. Coal production data include quantities extracted from surface and underground workings and normally exclude wastes removed at mines or associated preparation plants. The production of electricity from hydroelectric power and nuclear power includes both electric utility and", "industrial production reported on a net basis, thus excluding electricity that is generally used by the electric power plant for its own operating purposes or electricity losses in the transformers that are considered integral parts of the station. See Tables 105 and 106.", "20. Primary Stocks of Petroleum\u2014OECD. Petroleum stocks reported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) include those held at (or in) the following locations or facilities: leases, refineries, natural gas processing plants, bulk terminals, tanks associated with pipelines, barges, intercoastal tankers, ocean tankers in port, inland ship bunkers, major final consumers, and the strategic storage reserve. For an individual country, stocks include those held for the account of that country but located in another country. U.S. stocks include those held in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. \u201cOther OECD\u2019\u201d includes stocks held in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The OECD definition of petroleum stocks excludes petroleum in pipelines, rail tank cars, tank trucks, oceangoing ship bunkers, service stations, retail stores, and tankers at sea.
