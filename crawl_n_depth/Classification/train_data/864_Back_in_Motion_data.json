Unfortunately they are often poorly understood and frequently misdiagnosed resulting in unnecessary pain and time off training.", "While historically Achilles tendonitis was considered an inflammatory problem, the actual pathology of Achilles tendon pain is far more complex. Achilles tendon problems such as inflammation and acute pain are most commonly reactive, where the load placed through the Achilles is not beyond its capacity to repair and the body is able to recover.\u00a0", "However where there is extreme load or a reactive tendon is repeatedly stressed while trying to recover, cellular changes within the tendon lead to a gradual breakdown of the tendon structure eventually leading to a weak degenerative tendon. Once your Achilles gets to this stage, your body\u2019s healing response is gradually supressed and the prognosis becomes significantly worse.", "The Achilles tendon is easily overloaded due to its dual role as a propulsion force generator and a shock absorber. Variations in foot posture and gait can mean that the foot is less efficient at performing either of these functions. Over thousands of steps this increased stress leads to repetitive overload. Any pain in the Achilles particularly where it coincides with increases in training loads, changes in footwear or training surface, or changes in gait should be taken seriously.\u00a0\u00a0", "Achilles pain - perhaps more than any other injury - needs to be assessed and diagnosed accurately. While early signs of pain and tightness in the Achilles are often easily dealt with by managing load, the structural changes to the Achilles that characterise tendinopathies are often very hard to manage and require long periods of load modification and treatment. Always seek a professional opinion for management of Achilles pain.", "Do you have pain in your heel or arch? It could be plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis (or plantar fasciopathy) describes injury to strong sling of connective tissue that lies under the medial arch of the foot. It presents as pain in the heel and/or arch.", "The plantar fascia acts like a spring, supporting the medial arch and supplying energy to your feet.\u00a0 Much like with Achilles tendon pain, the plantar fascia is frequently overloaded by overtraining, incorrect footwear or improper technique. Having high arches can also impact on the foot\u2019s ability to absorb shock. The resulting irritation of the fascia, typically where it connects to the heel bone, creates a painful inflammatory response that is sometimes accompanied by tearing of the tissue structure. Once inflamed, the plantar fascia is easily stressed and aggravated. Standing on hard surfaces in bare feet or after a night\u2019s sleep can easily stress and aggravate an inflamed plantar fascia.", "The key to treating plantar facsia is to remove the load on the arches of your feet through rest and modification including orthotics, taping and correct footwear. In the early stages of treatment, pain management is critical including stretching, ice, and some form of soft tissue therapy. Finally it\u2019s critical to strengthen not only the arch of the foot but also the other load dispersing structures of the lower limbs such as your calves and hips.

Stiff or tight ankle.", "This can be due to tightness in the calf muscle complex, or from stiffness in the ankle joint itself. To perform an effective running stride, the knee needs to travel forward over the toes. When the ankle is stiff, this motion will be compensated for at other points in your body, which may lead to injury in the foot, the hip, knee and pelvis.", "2. Tightness in quads and hip flexors.", "As with ankle tightness, we need adequate extension at the hip to allow the body weight to travel forward over the toes while running. A simple way to check hip extension and quads length is to pull the knee back just behind the line of the body, then pull the heel towards your backside. You should be able to touch your heel to your bottom in this position without arching your back.", "3. Poor calf endurance.", "Calves provide a massive amount of drive while running. Yet all too often we see runners who are unable to complete even a few single leg calf raises with good technique. This suggests they are most likely not making full use of the remarkable system of levers and slings in the foot ankle and calf. At a minimum you should be able to perform 20 calf raises with correct form to help your running performance.", "4. Inability to perform an unassisted single leg squat.", "A single leg squat is a great way to test your lumbo-pelvic stability. Stand at a mirror or get someone to video both from the front and side. Check that your hips and pelvis stay level, and if your knee travels in a straight line over your toes. This exercise is explained below.", "Now that you\u2019ve identified any weaknesses, it\u2019s time to turn your body into a more efficient running machine. There are many variations on the ideal running technique so it\u2019s important to be realistic and comfortable. Nonetheless, there are a number of things you can do to correct any issues that may have built up during your winter hibernation.", "1. Reduce tightness in the hip flexors and hamstrings.", "We\u2019ve already mentioned tight hip flexors and quads, and this is a classic problem that we see clinically in athletes who spend their daytime sitting at work. The hip flexors and hamstring are placed in a shortened position, reducing the range of motion at the hip and creating tightness in the hamstrings. Remedy this with regular stretching of the hamstrings with hip extension exercises and mobility exercises like back rolls.", "2. Improve your trunk and lumbo-pelvic stability.", "Another problem often associated with prolonged periods of inactivity. Sitting disengages the trunk and pelvic stabilisers, which can gradually weaken with non-use which can contribute to poor form and increased fatigue when running. One of the single best exercises to improve this is the single leg squat. It forces our stabilising muscles to be used in a position that closely replicates phases of running. If a single leg squat is too difficult, try using a step or bench under your back foot to assist with your form initially.", "3. Stiff spine.", "A stiff spine can be equally as detrimental as an unstable one. Limited range of motion in the spine places increased pressure on the other areas of the body, including the hip and pelvis. Physiotherapy treatment is often used to improve spinal mobility, and there are also many exercises and stretches than can be used to reduce spine stiffness. To get started, try lying on your back and rolling your legs side to side on a fit ball, or pulling one knee at a time slowly into your chest.", "4. Get the calf muscles working correctly.", "Too many runners don\u2019t make full use of their most important running mechanism \u2013 the foot-calf-ankle complex. To ensure you are getting the most out of your calves, try performing calf raises while holding a ball between your heels. This will encourage you to transfer your weight toward your big toe as you reach the top of the exercise, and in turn improve your calf strength.", "Although many athletes returning to running forego thoughts of injury prevention in favour of just training harder, there is a lot of value in taking care of your body.

A recent study has shown that a pillow height of ten centimetres for back sleepers offers optimal spinal alignment and greatest comfort, leading to the least muscle activity2. To further alleviate any back strain while sleeping on your back a pillow or two can be placed underneath the knees to help flatten the lumbar lordosis which eases the pressure on facet joints.

Whilst sleeping on your side your ears, shoulders and hips should be aligned. A firm pillow placed in between the knees can assist in keeping the spine in a neutral position. Without support between the legs, the upper leg will rotate down which pulls the pelvis downwards, therefore increasing the stress on the hips and lumbar spine. Placing the top leg too far across the pillow can also cause the lumbar spine to twist and should be avoided; the legs should remain aligned, one directly over the other with a firm pillow in between. If you have a smaller waist in comparison to your hips, a small pillow or rolled towel can be placed under your waist to help support the spine in a neutral position.\u00a0\u00a0", "\u00a0", "Sleeping on your\u00a0stomachcan put the neck and back in a very stressful position.

Once the swelling is under control, you may also require a compression garment to wear.", "Compression Bandaging: ", "\nIf intensive lymphoedema treatment is required you may benefit from a course of compression bandaging. Bandaging affects oedema by reducing capillary filtration, increasing lymphatic drainage, shift of fluid to non-compromised areas, breakdown of fibro-sclerotic tissue, assists with reshaping the limb and can assist with wound healing.\u00a0 There are different types of bandaging available including the Coban 2 system by 3M, Compri2 by Jobst BSN or multi-layer lymphoedema bandaging (MLLB).
