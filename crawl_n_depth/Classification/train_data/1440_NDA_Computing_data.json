However if we wish all the copied formulas to refer to the variable cell B2 this   cell reference must be made absolute. We achieve this by pressing function key   F4 as we enter the cell reference B2 in the formula. The original formula then   appears as = B5*$B$2. If the formula is copied, the copied formulas will be =   C5*$B$2, = D5*$B$2 etc. Any change to the variable value in cell B2 will   automatically \u2018flow\u2019 through to all the formulas.
