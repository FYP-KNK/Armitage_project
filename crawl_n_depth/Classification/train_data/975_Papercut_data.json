This position is part of our core development philosophy and ensures that you as the PaperCut user have choice. We surveyed our user base a few years back and the overwhelming voice was that our vendor neutral position is important. It means that you have the ability to change operating systems, printer brands, MFD makes, etc. with minimal impact on PaperCut and its core features. That is, your implementation can remain intact. This,  however, is at times a difficult position for us. Aside from the engineering investment required to develop across multiple environments in parallel, we're also under pressure at times from organizations that would prefer to 'lock-in' to a particular environment or hardware/device. We've committed to remain neutral and will continue to support an open approach to infrastructure, hardware, and other services. Please note that a vendor neutral approach does not mean that all embedded offerings are created equal. We are reliant on the quality and feature-set of the underlying device (MFD) firmware and supporting SDK used to create our embedded software. In this regard some manufacturers can claim better integration and a fuller feature set, thereby setting their devices apart. In every case we strive to supply the very best user experience at the device.", "Yes. Where possible we support the same set of languages the PaperCut Admin web interface supports.
