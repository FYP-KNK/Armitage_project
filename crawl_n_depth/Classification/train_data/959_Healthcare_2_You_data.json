By placing the soap on your fingertips then gently rubbing the lenses under warm running water, you will be able to remove much of the dirt on the spectacles. The spectacles should then be dried with clean soft tissues or the\u00a0cleaning cloth which is provided inside the\u00a0Healthcare 2 You\u00a0\u2013 branded spectacle case.", "Our vision is a gift that we take for granted and as we age, we are exposed to many forms of degenerative eye diseases. Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye\u2019s optic nerve and result in vision loss and in some cases blindness.", "Although, early treatment can protect the eyes from any serious vision loss, unfortunately, most people have no symptoms and no warning signs. If this is left undiagnosed and untreated, it can cause gradual vision loss. If caught early though, it usually responds well to medication.", "Elderly people in Aged Care facilities cannot always communicate their concerns regarding their eyes and in some cases, they or their families are unable to facilitate a trip to the optometrist for an examination. Modern examination techniques and treatments have made glaucoma a rare cause of blindness in Australia. The tests to diagnose glaucoma are simple and painless and although glaucoma cannot be prevented, the treatment of it is relatively simple via medication and sometimes laser.", "Macular Degeneration is an eye disease that causes vision loss. In dry macular degeneration, the centre of the retina deteriorates. However, wet macular degeneration causes leaky blood vessels to grow under the retina. Macular Degeneration is the name given to a group of chronic, degenerative retinal eye diseases that cause progressive loss of central vision, leaving the peripheral or side vision intact. It affects the ability to read, drive, recognise faces and perform activities that require detailed vision. Macular Degeneration is the leading cause of legal blindness and severe vision loss in Australia as it is responsible for 50% of all cases of blindness.
