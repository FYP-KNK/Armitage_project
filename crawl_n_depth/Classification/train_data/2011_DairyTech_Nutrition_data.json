Turnips are a seasonal opportunity for dietary calcium intake, restoration of clover in pasture swards will benefit ryegrass production as well as increasing calcium content in grazed pasture.

Our valuable feed ends up in manure pats in the paddock instead of milk in the vat.

Essentially, $1.57 difference in profit.", "The plot thickens: The group of cows consuming the quality pasture will have 1.852 kgs DM fibre still in their rumens tomorrow reducing their feed intake for tomorrow and limiting tomorrow\u2019s milk production by 3.39 lts. The cows consuming the mature pasture will have 4.827 kgs DM fibre remaining in their rumens tomorrow. This reduces their feed intake tomorrow and reduces milk production by 7.91 lts.", "Yes this is an extreme example for the purpose of highlighting the influence of 24 hr digestibility, as no forage fibre is 100% digestible in 24 hrs.

Healthy pasture plants then produce healthy soils, there is a synergy here between these two, but it starts with healthy and actively growing plants.

Fertilizer is always the cheapest feed!", "Silage: As above, maturity at cutting is number one. Time between cutting and ensiling is number two (see our article \u2018Silage in a Day\u2019 sept 15). Third is a quality lactic acid bacterial silage inoculant containing a proven enzyme pack. Enzymes will break down indigestible fibre converting it to sugars for lactic acid producing bacteria to convert to lactic acid \u2013 high palatability/silage intake.

However, we need to look at this more closely. Should we talk just feeds per se, or energy? It is energy we convert to milk. We should be discussing the cost of energy in any given feed when deciding what is cheapest. Effectively, feed dollars converted to milk dollars for this is the real determinant of profit.", "That\u2019s the simple equation, but from there on it can become quite complicated by debates over the cost of grass, by rates of digestibility (a subject I want to address next month), and by rumen health/function or feed conversion efficiency. We will leave these complications out of this discussion as my goal is to drive forage production on farm to at least validate the mantra of home grown feeds being the cheapest.", "Home grown forage may or may not be the cheapest forage, but grain generally stands alone on energy cost. Home grown forage cost depends heavily on the value of the land it is grown on, the yield per annum per hectare, its digestibility and energy density. For our regular monthly clients we can determine grass grazed in tonnes of dry matter (TDM) and collate monthly averages for the full year. We can add to this quite accurately TDM silage, measure summer crops and cost each out. Due to wide variations between farms on the above criteria, we choose to take a mean value for grazed pasture at $250/TDM. This gives us a basis for silage cost, and good comparative data within farms from year to year.", "I believe the district average for SW Victoria is in the vicinity 4 to 4.5 TDM/ha pasture harvested (machine or grazed). Yet we are aware of farms where we have measurement from monthly consumption, harvesting 10 TDM/ha and higher. Obviously, there is a massive difference in pasture cost irrespective of additional input cost to achieve this high TDM/ha. There usually is a serendipitous increase in digestibility with higher yielding farms, and this only magnifies the feed to milk dollar conversion potential/profit.", "I raise this subject each year around July/August as that is when we prepare Feed Budgets for our clients. It is the most-timely part of the season to do so, so we can plan summer forage crops types/hectares etc., estimate silage requirements including our goal of 50% extra for reserves, based on the previous year\u2019s forage harvested over each farm. Solid silage reserves can insulate us significantly from the many vagaries of season, grain and milk price we are subject to these days. Achieving these silage reserves also come under our summer cropping program with crops such as sorghum.", "Over many years of preparing Feed Budgets for clients, compounded by observations, we have come to realise some of the limitations to home grown forage production. Things like compaction \u2013 pasture plants pulled up by grazing cows due to shallow rooting. Declining plant densities, and falling yields which are now known to be associated with lack of rotational crops. Differing plant species remove and deposit different things in soil, but all contribute to improved yields. There are synergies to yield through plant rotations. To resolve these impediments to yield we developed a Seven Year Paddock Plan for each of our clients. The goal is to address the above limitations, improve soil health/organic matter and yield capacity. The basic idea is two years in crops, up to three crops per year, then back to pasture for five years.", "We believe, based on overseas data, that we can increase home grown forage harvested and hence lower the cost of feed, or rather, the cost of energy harvested/ha, through crop rotations. This principle has been known and practiced, especially by cereal grows, for many years. Both land (due to land value), and cows (due to maintenance energy cost), have fixed costs that can only be diluted to the benefit of profit, by increased yield \u2013 either TDM/ha or litres/cow.", "Our potential to achieve this in our dairying areas is massive. The next \u2018big thing\u2019, we believe. We have clients that have achieved dramatically increased TDM harvested over their farms simply through summer fodder crop programs. We are now taking that to a new level with a more holistic plan spanning seven years. Our goals include improving soil health/productivity through rotational crops, addressing soil compaction, initially mechanically, but further through selecting deep rooted crops. Deep ripping has questions over its effectiveness in the longer term, and possible damage to soil structure, but can certainly open ground to facilitate deeper rooting of crops/plants immediately following.", "Rotational cropping has added potential to increase soil organic matter, an issue we think has deteriorated our dairy land\u2019s productivity over the last fifty years. The benefits of increased organic matter on an organic farm we work with showcase this potential. This organic farm nowadays would out yield many conventional farms and has a per cow milk production average 60% higher than the national average.", "Crop root systems deposit organic matter in soils. Likewise, stubble from crops, although nitrogen must be available to breakdown residue or new seedlings will suffer retarded growth until plant residue has been broken down. A clover crop through winter can provide excellent high calcium silage for dry and springing cows, but also increase soil N for the following summer crop. We have measured very high turnip yields following a winter clover crop.", "Overseas research has demonstrated reduced weed and pest problems through rotational crop programs. As with antibiotics in treating disease/infections in cows, we will be restricted in the use of these and plant protection chemicals in the very near future. Garden enthusiasts know well that various plants protect and encourage growth in other plants. We need to return our farms to more natural biology, and I\u2019m confident we can do so and increase our profitability.", "Calcium is essential for mineral movement in soils, making them available to plants, and for the same reason in cows\u2019 digestive systems. The application of lime to farms has deteriorated dramatically over my lifetime. I suspect this too has reduced our soil\u2019s capacity to support vibrant plant growth, apart from soil pH.", "The last twelve months has shocked us all, both farmers and the service industry. Innovation and prosperity almost always rises from the rubble of adversity; and rarely from affluence.", "John Lyne is a dairy production specialist with Dairytech Nutrition", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "There are three aspects associated with dairy farming that can elevate or decimate farm profits, and individual cows especially. Feed, Fertility and Lameness. All three are highly related, outside environmental causes to lameness. So, the answer is YES!", "FEED: As obvious as it may seem, feed and fertility are well research-proven limitations to farm profit. Based on the Australian 305 day lactation average milk production, clearly we are underfeeding our cows by at least 4+ kgs DM daily. We have bred cows through genetic advancement that have far greater capacity for converting feed dollars to milk dollars, yet we have not taken advantage of our investment in genetics when our national average milk production is half that of the USA.", "I\u2019ve been told for 40 years we are a different industry from the USA. Problem is; we are competing on the same world markets against more efficient milk production systems. Further, cows are cows and feed is feed, irrespective of delivery system; grazed or TMR. Producing more milk from the same fixed costs (land and cow maintenance energy cost), increases our competitiveness, but more so, our profit.", "Having the feed to optimise our cows\u2019 capacity for converting it to milk dollars is a multifaceted issue we\u2019ll look more closely at next month under the heading of Feed Budgeting. Suffice to say, as all my consultancy clients know, number one is allowing cows access to feed per se. From there we look to planning the growing of forages that are highly digestible. We can fill a cow to contentment with hay, but she will not convert that hay to much milk. Worse still, the conversion of hay dollars to milk dollars is not profitable due mostly to very slow digestibility rates that limit daily dry matter intakes.", "From here we look at energy and protein densities. How much energy and protein is in each kg of dry matter consumed by our cow. She has a physical limit to DM feed intake, so the higher the energy and protein in each kg DM of feed, the higher the total energy/protein intake will be, and obviously, how much milk she will produce daily.", "We run a ratio in our diet analysis program of energy to maintenance and production. This ratio is critical in determining feed cost per litre of milk produced. Further, as this ratio shifts according to feed intake, digestibility and energy density, the cost of producing a litre of milk rises or falls rapidly. There is a multiplier effect occurring in the shifts of this ratio; for better or worse.", "Feed intake, digestibility and energy/protein density are the \u2018macros\u2019 of dairy nutrition and production. However, the next plane is mineral nutrition. Our forages are a \u2018mixed bag\u2019 of minerals, some excessive and some deficient. For example, our forages tend to be between excessive, and highly excessive in potassium \u2013 fertilizer dependant. Our cows have a massive requirement for calcium, and pastures are very low in calcium; likewise, magnesium. It is essential we supplement our cows to regulate excesses and supply deficiencies. Cows also have a high salt requirement.", "Next we need to consider trace minerals. Although they are supplemented in very small amounts, they are highly essential to many biological functions of dairy cows, including our opening claim of feed, fertility and lameness. Trace minerals are not very bioavailable from plant tissue, and hence must be supplemented via mineral premixes in grain.", "Following are the critical roles of commonly supplemented trace minerals and vitamins. Copper, Manganese and Zinc play important roles in protein synthesis, vitamin metabolism, the growth of ligaments and immune function. Cobalt is essential to B12 vitamin production in the rumen, and if not limited, will supply all the cows\u2019 need for B12. Vitamins A & D are commonly supplemented despite their natural availability from green forages and sunlight respectively, to ensure no compromised requirement.", "There are two other essential supplements that I have left until we look at fertility, as they are critical to that major profit driver. They are; the trace mineral selenium and vitamin E. Both have vital roles in uterine health the therefore fertility. Further, both are antioxidants which have important roles in stabilising fatty acids and soluble vitamins. Their role in reducing toxicity of fats is very significant in our grazing based system as pasture has very high fat. The obvious sign of excessive dietary fats from pasture is suppressed BF%. Antioxidants also prevent the formation of free radicals affecting digestion of feeds and animal health.", "Fertility then becomes a natural and serendipitous outcome of a fresh cow that has not suffered excessive negative energy balance from underfeeding, or pre-calving nutrition, has her mineral and vitamin requirements met, and then, a healthy and vital uterus. The one issue that can decimate all the above, is lameness.", "Lameness prevention has specific nutritional needs, all of which are mentioned above related to milk production and fertility. However, to highlight a few very necessary preventative measures, we ensure adequate zinc is fed for formation of sound hoof material. Limit weight loss post-calving which can reduce the fat pad and its \u2018shock-absorber\u2019 function in the heel, and of course, feed buffering agents and adequate effective fibre for good rumen health and mitigation of sub-optimal ruminal pH (SARA).", "Supplementing Biotin in mineral mixes added to grain has significant benefits to hoof integrity.", "Addressing environmental causes to lameness such as track maintenance, minimising sharp turns on concrete (exiting rotary platforms especially) or covering with rubber mats will reduce injury and ware to hooves. Applying zinc sulphate and copper sulphate solutions alternately via absorbent mats while exiting dairies are beneficial in drying and hardening soles during wet conditions, reducing risk of stone punctures and bruising.", "Despite our best efforts in all the above, I cannot stress enough that failed transition nutrition, which I\u2019ve written on numerous times over the past few months, will severely reduce our ability to enhance our cows\u2019 capacity for profitable lactations through feed, fertility and the absence of lameness. A recent report highlighted the fresh cow\u2019s energy need as being similar to a human running two marathons daily. Nothing impacts post-calving energy (feed intake) like transition nutrition.", "Nutrition provides a massive \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 from dry-off to pregnancy for highly profitable dairy business.", "\u00a0", "Transition appears to be a subject we preach to ad nauseam. However, in the wise words of Dr Tom Overton (Cornell University), we need to shift our view of transition from a time of disease threat to one of production/reproduction opportunity.", "The assumption that all is well, based on no, or little clinical milk fever or ketosis, is far from the truth. Any clinical disease at calving is a flag that we have significant sub-clinical issues, and research has verified the financial magnitude of sub-clinical metabolic disease as far more costly. When metabolism is dysfunctional around calving it may not manifest into clinical disease, but sub-clinical disease will reduce production and fertility. Improvements in milk production and fertility are economically significant.", "There are large datasets from commercial herds highlighting both the prevalence of sub-clinical disease and its impact on milk and reproductive performance. Research focus on blood calcium status post-calving show cows with sub-optimal blood calcium one week after calving had twice the displaced abomasum rate, produced 2 to 5 litres less milk and 30% decreased conception rates at first service.", "Research by Ospina et al, 2010 studied high NETA and BHBA (ketosis indicators) levels in transition cows found that 15% of herds with elevated levels was alarm level and could reduce heifer production by 500 lts and mature cows by 300 lts. Over 71 herds involved in this research, 50% were in excess of 15% affected cows.", "Sub-clinical milk fever and ketosis, they usually go together, along with most other transition problems, can be prevented. Anionic lead feeds are a simple answer to sub-clinical milk fever, and managing energy from dry-off to calving will minimise sub-clinical ketosis. Most other transition problems are secondary disease as a result of these two. Both these diseases carry long-term financial consequences.", "We all look for the Silver Bullet that will lift our farms profitability. Reality is, transition can well be that silver bullet, but it requires attention to less obvious details. Simple things like a change in forage of the springer cow ration can throw the ration DCAD out significantly, and suddenly we have cows down at worst, but also unknown sub-clinical disease from an equally unknown change in forage potassium level.", "Profits won or lost around transition are major due to lactation-long impacts. No other activity on a dairy farm will yield a higher return on time invested. Checking urine pH of springer cows at least weekly and adjusting the anionic lead feed grain fed to restore the correct pH will virtually eliminate sub-clinical milk fever. Checking fresh cow\u2019s milk with a milk keto test strip at day three post-calving and drenching anything in excess of a reading of 100 with propylene glycol will likewise virtually eliminate sub-clinical ketosis. Without these two most common calving related diseases, you will not just lift the bar on potential milk production, but also have given fertility a boost.", "The two drivers of farm profit are feed, because it translates to litres and milk dollars, and fertility, because fresh cows convert feed dollars to milk dollars far more efficiently.

Imbalance in both energy and immune system are inevitable at calving; the degree of severity will determine the domino effect this has; being the cascade of metabolic and infectious diseases that can be precipitated from these two crucial functions of our calving cow.", "\nAs stated in earlier articles, my definition of transition extends from dry-off to pregnancy. From dry-off, the nutritional issues will determine our success in timely pregnancy. Dry-off BCS has been reducing over the last ten years as research correlates higher BCS with poor post-calving feed intakes, especially rate of increase. Hormonally driven milk increase, not being met by feed (energy) intake, and the gap widens in overconditioned dry cows in the first few weeks.", "\nNegative energy balance and immune imbalance are intimately related, and our goal as manages is to minimise the severity and duration of both. Failure to meet energy post-calving leads to sub-optimal immunity and the dominos start falling. Immune function is an energy-hungry machine. If cows are quietly fighting sub-infection while dry, then energy becomes a scarce resource immediately at calving due a massive increase demanded by the mamary system, we\u2019ll have a \u2018health\u2019 implosion. This scenario will only amplify the NEB crisis by reducing feed intake at the most critical time. It is well documented, sick cows, either clinical or sub-clinical, lose appetite.", "\nTo understand the magnitude of the increase in energy demand at the point of calving, researches have quantified this shift from 680 gm of glucose precalving to 1.8 kgs immediately post-calving. It almost trebles! The liver works overtime converting substrate from rumination to glucose, plus some help from body fat and protein. This is the tripping point: how much from rumination (feed intake), and how much comes from body reserves. As above, the lighter cow at calving will increase feed intake more rapidly than the heavier cow and hence reduce her reliance on conversion of body fat and protein to meet the mamary system\u2019s demand as milk production escalates.", "\nThe immune system is already under pressure simply from the physical stress of calving. Any other physical stress factors will only multiply the demand on the immune system. Management can play a significant role here in preparitory minimisation of external stressors to our calving cow. Once energy supply becomes an issue, immunity will not cope with normal bacterial exposure at calving, let alone any preconditions, like mastitis. Retained membrane followed by metritis send the immune system into overload and inability to meet infection outbreaks. Again, all this only multiplies the energy issue by reducing feed intake. Here go the dominos!", "\nWe have two lines of health issues from here: infection due to compromised immune function, and metabolic disease due to excessive fat mobilisation, trying to meet the glucose deficiency, creating fatty liver syndrome and soon after, ketosis. Managing energy is the key.", "There is a crisis where normal negative energy balance passes the point of no return. The mediators sent out by the immune system to fight infection also cause inflamation. Inflamation is good to a point. Inflamation is crucial in controlling intial bacterial invasion recruiting immune cells to the site of infection. However, imbalance in the immune system will cause excessive inflamation and incomplete killing of bacteria, pain and swelling for the cow, either external or internal.", "\nInflamation is also very counter to conception. The inflamation in the uterus from a clinical mastitis case will devistate conception or holding of early pregnancies due to physical and chemical changes in uterine mucus. Immune mediators travel via the blood system, so inflamation is systemic.", "\nHow do we manage it?", "\nDry-off in lower BCS than has been customary. Keeping cows milking well up to dry off will enable this. Cows dried off in summer/early autumn can be a problem due to low protein diet at that time of year. It is imperative the dry cow has no weight gain or loss while dry. Either will precipate the reduced feed intake post-claving. Controlling the dry cow diet is easy during late summer early autumn when pasture intake is not a problem. Good quality adlib silage will do the job nicely.", "\nAs discussed in a previous article, 30% to 40% clover must be our pasture goal to meet cows calcium need on top of supplementation in bale feed. Silage made from this pasture mix will also meet the dry cow\u2019s calcium need with significant benefits to immunity, milk protein production and fertility. Controlling energy intake in dry cows once pasture is available requires more monitoring. Adlib hay rings and strip grazing calculating pasture energy intake by monitoring hay consumption and adjusting strip width, is as close as we can get in a grazing system.", "\nThe springer cow diet is, as above, plus 3 or 4 kgs of a good lead feed grain mix including anionic salts. Again, it is imperative we monitor/calculate energy intake. DCAD (Dietary Cation/Anion Difference) is critical to springer cows. This is easily done by checking urine pH several times each week. A pH of 5.5 to 6.5 with Jerseys at the lower end and holsteins toward the other end. Drenching cows at calving with propylene glycol is very successful in mitigating ketosis. We have several clients with computer rotary dairys who administer small doses of propylene glycol to fresh cows for 20 days via the computer.", "\nKetosis status is easily measured with a Milk Keto Test Strip. We encourage all cows be checked at day three for ketosis. Any cow with a reading above 100, treat with propylene glycol: 200 to 400 ml dependant on the severity of the reading. Recheck three days later and retreat as above.", "\nIf we\u2019ve been successful with both dry cow and springer cow nutrition, including mineral supplementation, both trace and macro, we\u2019ll avoid most of the problems, metabolic and infection. Our cow is now capable of reaching her genetic potential for milk production, and, contrary to popular belief, most likely to become pregnant in a timely manner.

He says further, \u201cHigh dry matter intake solves a lot of problems on a lot of farms\u201d. I could not agree more!", "Nothing reduces immediate profit, converting feed dollars to milk dollars, than underfeeding. Most common feeds in our dairy industry are capable to being converted from 1 kg DM of feed to 2 litres of milk after maintenance is met. The math is fairly simple. Even feed at 30c/kg DM (barley) will convert to at least 60c of milk income. Obviously energy density of that feed does influence conversion efficiency. Nevertheless, the lesson stands; if you want to increase profit dramatically, then offer more feed to your cows.", "From 16 years of production consulting and 25 years of dairy farming, I can assure you the average Australian dairy cow is 4 kgs DM underfeed. That\u2019s 8+ litres! By our conversion factor of 1 kg DM feed to 2 litres of milk this would produce $1/cow/day more profit. Our cows have incredible capacity to make profit from converting feed to milk.", "So why didn\u2019t our cow eat the extra feed?", "1) Without doubt, she did not have access to the extra feed. This is by far the greatest limitation to profit in Australian dairy businesses. While the lactation average for the last twelve months in the USA was 10,450 litres and ours is 5200 litres, yet we hope to compete with the USA on world markets, I can assure you the simple difference is feed intake; bar none. The preparation of Feed Budgets for our clients is solely aimed at optimising milk production which has direct relationship to profit, and worse (or better), by a multiplier coefficient.", "2) Her rumen is full. Isn\u2019t this what we\u2019re aiming for? Yes, if the feed is balanced for energy, protein and fibre. No if the fibre level is too high and it spends long periods of time in the rumen being digested. Indigestible fibre especially slows down the rate of passage of feed through the digestive tract reducing total feed intake; and milk production. The monthly ration analysis we do for all clients has the goal of a balanced and productive ration to optimise milk production under feed scenarios throughout the season. This is also tempered by what we grow to meet the Feed Budget.", "3) The cow stops eating for no apparent reason. This usually occurs from metabolic signalling within the cow\u2019s system. Too much rapidly fermented carbohydrate reducing rumen pH, either clinically or sub-clinical (SARA). Grain is not the only culprit here.

Traditionally, dry cows ingest around 25% of their calcium requirement when on ryegrass pasture, silage or hay. Blood samples we\u2019ve taken from dry cows verify this. Our dry cow is most frequently in subclinical milk fever (subclinical hypocalcaemia) and not even milking! Likewise, blood tests would expose negative energy balance (subclinical ketosis) in many dry cows. Our dry cow is already in deep trouble and still maybe five or six weeks off calving.", "Low blood calcium is highly likely to produce impaired immune function, delayed reproduction and bring on other metabolic disorders such as ketosis. We are trialling several methods to lift dry cow calcium intakes this January/February. The herds in which we are having very good success with, apart from adequate calcium intakes (and other minerals too), have the same forage ration as dry cows as they do as springer cows. The only difference is the addition of 3 or 4 kgs of a good Lead Feed grain mix to increase energy and protein intake, and a correct DCAD to mobilise calcium/magnesium reserves from skeletal frame. As we shift our dry cow into the springer cow group, DCAD, or Dietary Cation-Anion Difference, becomes a major management issue; and it can be managed very effectively without feed testing every feed in the ration.", "DCAD and cow health and performance are closely intertwined. However, there may be some lack of understanding of this, leading to failure to achieve the best possible results from post-calving feeding.

Our goal is a negative DCAD for springing cows for 21 days.", "The negative DCAD ration will cause mild blood acidosis and instigate calcium reabsorption from bones to neutralise blood acidity.

We want a urine pH of around 6 for Holsteins and 5.8 for Jerseys. Simply adjust the Lead Feed grain up or down to correct this pH reading. We typically run a 3 kg Lead Feed grain mix at -3200meq.", "The reward is dramatically reduced milk fever (clinical or subclinical), dystocia (long/difficult calvings), ketosis and retained placenta.

Lactating DCAD should be positive. This is not difficult in our potassium charged pastures, silages and pasture hays. In fact it is commonly way too high inducing both calcium and magnesium deficiencies manifesting, at worst, mid-lactation milk fever and hypomag (flightiness in cows). Lactating cows need a positive DCAD around +200/250. Needless to say, any metabolic disruption from excessive DCAD will impinge on all the production goals.", "The other insidious evil so prevalent in our fresh cows is ketosis. The clinical ketosis cow has a very limited future, but the subclinical ketosis cow will be quietly draining your bank account from low productivity in all its forms: Impaired immunity manifesting in mastitis, metritis and other infections; demolishing our fertility goals and as she progresses into mid-lactation and still empty, her feed conversion efficiency plummets \u2013 a costly passenger. In many of our clients herds, as fertility has improved providing an abundance of replacement heifers, carry-over cows no long exist. Seasons like this spring/summer we\u2019ve reduced herd size to match feed reserves, and in so doing, rid our herds of any underperforming cows.

With sunlight, plant sugars rise rapidly, and the use of a quality silage inoculant is sound management under perfect conditions, but in wet conditions not to use inoculant will allow wild (\u2019natural\u2019) bacteria to do your fermenting rather than controlled fermentation achieved by a quality lactic acid bacterial inoculant. Nobody sows \u2018natural\u2019 seed and expects a pure ryegrass pasture.", "Trial work conducted by Tom Kilcer (Advanced Ag Systems \u2013 Cornell University), control silage (no inoculant) had higher lignin (indigestible) than treatment silages. This indicated the control silage suffered considerable more dry matter converted to CO2 and water and so was lost. Mike Van Amburg (Cornell University) reported from trial work at Cornell, that inoculated silages had significantly higher net energy and digestibility rates than uninoculated silages. From digestibility alone, this equates to over 1 litre of milk.", "Dr Limin Kung, world authority on inoculant use, although referring to corn silage, but relevant also for grass silage said: \u201cFor a wet crop, a homolactic is better\u2026do not use Lactobacillus Buccneri on a very wet corn silage crop \u2013 or the odds that you will get an inversion of lactic to acetic (more acetic than lactic) is high. Wet corn silage fermentations will make a lot of acid, and a lot of wild acetic. This may cause issues at feed out.\u201d", "There is also a high risk of mud contamination of silage.

None more so than calcium.", "Following from last month\u2019s article on trace minerals, and they are all fat-soluble, so when fed during the dry phase when there is no production demand, cows will deposit trace minerals in body fat reserves. Once calved, and drawing on body fat reserves to meet energy requirement, the cow will be mobilising not just fat, but fat well impregnated with trace minerals.", "Macro minerals, phosphorous, magnesium and calcium mostly, when supplied during the dry phase are similarly stored, this time in skeletal bone, also for reabsorption on demand post-calving. The demand for milk production post-calving and minerals required to meet this demand, cannot be consumed in feed or even mineral fortified grain mixes in the quantities needed. A rule of thumb is cows need supplemented minerals early lactation to complement those drawn from body reserves to meet lactation/fertility demands for the first 100 days, then supplemented plus what is absorbed from feeds will meet lactation needs during the second 100 days. Finally, supplementation during the third 100 days will begin the process of storing minerals for early lactation next time round.", "This needs to continue through the dry cow phase.

And this was only highlighting dry matter intake. Rumination data tells nothing of nutrient intake. Turning out dry cows to back paddocks or out-blocks with no dietary supervision will negate the best springer cow management.", "Dry Matter intake is obviously the first consideration. The risk of low intake, and hence low energy and protein, during drier months is very high. Conversely, the risk of excessive intake, particularly excessive energy intake in abundant pasture, is equally as damaging to the cow entering the springing group for lead feeding. The first will have lost weight, mobilising body fat to meet her energy needs, the second will have gained weight and will certainly have low intake post-calving. Either scenario will induce fatty liver syndrome/ketosis post-calving.", "We have verified both these scenarios through blood testing cows as they enter the springer group (post-dry period) and soon after calving. Both showed high BHBA readings, the indicator of sub-clinical ketosis from excessive fat metabolism.", "The Summer Dry Cow. Pasture hay or cereal hay will rarely meet the dry cow\u2019s energy needs. She will need an energy supplement in the form of grain. Pasture silage generally will be higher in energy than hay and will meet her energy needs. Adlib intakes of either hay or silage make for easy management. If grain with mineral inclusion is fed (dairy grain), then minerals should be adequate assuming the dairy grain is adequate in mineral inclusion. Where just silage or hay is fed, dry cows must have mineral supplementation. We manufacture a self-feed/controlled intake loose-lick mineral product, high in calcium, for this purpose.

Dry cows with access to unlimited pasture will gain weight and predispose themselves to ketosis post-calving. Don\u2019t underestimate this risk of sub-clinical ketosis as too often the condition passes unnoticed unless the cow is tested. There are milk keto test strips available for doing this. A combination of the energy density of pasture and the cow\u2019s capacity to consume large quantities invariable exposes her to weight gain and suppressed feed intake post-calving, and the ketosis risk again. Do not rely on BCS scoring to tell you if these risks are occurring. By the time you can see a change in body score, I assure you, she is well on her way to ketosis.", "Only blood tests will pick this up well before the risk factor has become disease. Blood testing of dry cows has also highlighted negative energy balance and weight loss when it was assumed there was ample pasture available. We always have adlib silage or hay on offer to dry cows even with \u2018heaps of pasture\u2019 available! I also defy anybody who can accurately tell me grazed pasture intake from eye or electronic assessment of pasture stands.", "Unmanaged grazing will encourage selective grazing. This results in dry cows consuming highly digestible regrowth, high in energy and crude protein, but very low in fibre. The end result is acidotic dry cows. Back to the stress factors in last month\u2019s article. Dry cows need a high fibre diet for good rumination and repair of rumen wall damage from sub-optimal rumen pH bouts during lactation. Yes it\u2019s a tension, like everything else in life, but it\u2019s also management, and nothing impacts profit (milk price excluded) like good cow and feed management.", "The second issue in dry cow nutrition revolves around immunity, which is not unrelated to nutrition. A high fibre diet with adequate energy and protein will promote a strong immune system. Alternately, inadequate energy/protein intake will induce mobilisation of body fat to support maintenance and pregnancy and is the first step to depriving the immune system of its nutritional needs.", "A dry cow diet inadequate in fibre will promote reduced rumen pH from low rumination/saliva production and nutritional deficiencies due to undigested feed passing out in manure. However, sub-clinical acidosis is a stress factor that will disable immunity\u2019s full capacity to deal with any bacterial or pathogen assault.", "Dry Cow Therapy in conjunction with your veterinarian, be it just Dry Cow Treatment and/or Teat Seal is certainly an investment in both post-calving milk production and fertility.

From dry-off, the nutritional issues will determine our success in timely pregnancy. Dry-off BCS has been reducing over the last ten years as research correlates higher BCS with poor post-calving feed intakes, especially rate of increase. Hormonally driven milk increase, not being met by feed (energy) intake, and the gap widens in overconditioned dry cows in the first few weeks.", "\nNegative energy balance and immune imbalance are intimately related, and our goal as manages is to minimise the severity and duration of both. Failure to meet energy post-calving leads to sub-optimal immunity and the dominos start falling. Immune function is an energy-hungry machine. If cows are quietly fighting sub-infection while dry, then energy becomes a scarce resource immediately at calving due a massive increase demanded by the mamary system, we\u2019ll have a \u2018health\u2019 implosion. This scenario will only amplify the NEB crisis by reducing feed intake at the most critical time. It is well documented, sick cows, either clinical or sub-clinical, lose appetite.", "\nTo understand the magnitude of the increase in energy demand at the point of calving, researches have quantified this shift from 680 gm of glucose precalving to 1.8 kgs immediately post-calving. It almost trebles! The liver works overtime converting substrate from rumination to glucose, plus some help from body fat and protein. This is the tripping point: how much from rumination (feed intake), and how much comes from body reserves. As above, the lighter cow at calving will increase feed intake more rapidly than the heavier cow and hence reduce her reliance on conversion of body fat and protein to meet the mamary system\u2019s demand as milk production escalates.", "\nThe immune system is already under pressure simply from the physical stress of calving. Any other physical stress factors will only multiply the demand on the immune system. Management can play a significant role here in preparitory minimisation of external stressors to our calving cow. Once energy supply becomes an issue, immunity will not cope with normal bacterial exposure at calving, let alone any preconditions, like mastitis. Retained membrane followed by metritis send the immune system into overload and inability to meet infection outbreaks. Again, all this only multiplies the energy issue by reducing feed intake. Here go the dominos!", "\nWe have two lines of health issues from here: infection due to compromised immune function, and metabolic disease due to excessive fat mobilisation, trying to meet the glucose deficiency, creating fatty liver syndrome and soon after, ketosis. Managing energy is the key.", "There is a crisis where normal negative energy balance passes the point of no return. The mediators sent out by the immune system to fight infection also cause inflamation. Inflamation is good to a point. Inflamation is crucial in controlling intial bacterial invasion recruiting immune cells to the site of infection. However, imbalance in the immune system will cause excessive inflamation and incomplete killing of bacteria, pain and swelling for the cow, either external or internal.", "\nInflamation is also very counter to conception. The inflamation in the uterus from a clinical mastitis case will devistate conception or holding of early pregnancies due to physical and chemical changes in uterine mucus. Immune mediators travel via the blood system, so inflamation is systemic.", "\nHow do we manage it?", "\nDry-off in lower BCS than has been customary. Keeping cows milking well up to dry off will enable this. Cows dried off in summer/early autumn can be a problem due to low protein diet at that time of year. It is imperative the dry cow has no weight gain or loss while dry. Either will precipate the reduced feed intake post-claving. Controlling the dry cow diet is easy during late summer early autumn when pasture intake is not a problem. Good quality adlib silage will do the job nicely.", "\nAs discussed in a previous article, 30% to 40% clover must be our pasture goal to meet cows calcium need on top of supplementation in bale feed. Silage made from this pasture mix will also meet the dry cow\u2019s calcium need with significant benefits to immunity, milk protein production and fertility. Controlling energy intake in dry cows once pasture is available requires more monitoring. Adlib hay rings and strip grazing calculating pasture energy intake by monitoring hay consumption and adjusting strip width, is as close as we can get in a grazing system.", "\nThe springer cow diet is, as above, plus 3 or 4 kgs of a good lead feed grain mix including anionic salts. Again, it is imperative we monitor/calculate energy intake. DCAD (Dietary Cation/Anion Difference) is critical to springer cows. This is easily done by checking urine pH several times each week. A pH of 5.5 to 6.5 with Jerseys at the lower end and holsteins toward the other end. Drenching cows at calving with propylene glycol is very successful in mitigating ketosis. We have several clients with computer rotary dairys who administer small doses of propylene glycol to fresh cows for 20 days via the computer.", "\nKetosis status is easily measured with a Milk Keto Test Strip.

Recheck three days later and retreat as above.", "\nIf we\u2019ve been successful with both dry cow and springer cow nutrition, including mineral supplementation, both trace and macro, we\u2019ll avoid most of the problems, metabolic and infection.

Most common feeds in our dairy industry are capable to being converted from 1 kg DM of feed to 2 litres of milk after maintenance is met. The math is fairly simple. Even feed at 30c/kg DM (barley) will convert to at least 60c of milk income. Obviously energy density of that feed does influence conversion efficiency. Nevertheless, the lesson stands; if you want to increase profit dramatically, then offer more feed to your cows.", "From 16 years of production consulting and 25 years of dairy farming, I can assure you the average Australian dairy cow is 4 kgs DM underfeed. That\u2019s 8+ litres! By our conversion factor of 1 kg DM feed to 2 litres of milk this would produce $1/cow/day more profit. Our cows have incredible capacity to make profit from converting feed to milk.", "So why didn\u2019t our cow eat the extra feed?", "1) Without doubt, she did not have access to the extra feed. This is by far the greatest limitation to profit in Australian dairy businesses. While the lactation average for the last twelve months in the USA was 10,450 litres and ours is 5200 litres, yet we hope to compete with the USA on world markets, I can assure you the simple difference is feed intake; bar none.

Isn\u2019t this what we\u2019re aiming for? Yes, if the feed is balanced for energy, protein and fibre. No if the fibre level is too high and it spends long periods of time in the rumen being digested. Indigestible fibre especially slows down the rate of passage of feed through the digestive tract reducing total feed intake; and milk production. The monthly ration analysis we do for all clients has the goal of a balanced and productive ration to optimise milk production under feed scenarios throughout the season. This is also tempered by what we grow to meet the Feed Budget.", "3) The cow stops eating for no apparent reason. This usually occurs from metabolic signalling within the cow\u2019s system. Too much rapidly fermented carbohydrate reducing rumen pH, either clinically or sub-clinical (SARA). Grain is not the only culprit here. It can be rapidly growing pasture with low fibre, frequently cows go from the dairy (grain) straight onto turnips which are highly digestible. Silage feed in between these two will solve a lot of digestive limitations to feed intake. Our pastures have risen in unsaturated fats in recent years through plant breeding. The rumen must convert these unsaturated fats to saturated fats before being transported to the mammary system. An excess of fat will reduce intake, reduce digestion of fibre and in high excess, will crash BF%. Mineral supplementation is essential for health, fertility, but also appetite and feed intake.

Over 71 herds involved in this research, 50% were in excess of 15% affected cows.", "Sub-clinical milk fever and ketosis, they usually go together, along with most other transition problems, can be prevented. Anionic lead feeds are a simple answer to sub-clinical milk fever, and managing energy from dry-off to calving will minimise sub-clinical ketosis. Most other transition problems are secondary disease as a result of these two. Both these diseases carry long-term financial consequences.", "We all look for the Silver Bullet that will lift our farms profitability. Reality is, transition can well be that silver bullet, but it requires attention to less obvious details. Simple things like a change in forage of the springer cow ration can throw the ration DCAD out significantly, and suddenly we have cows down at worst, but also unknown sub-clinical disease from an equally unknown change in forage potassium level.", "Profits won or lost around transition are major due to lactation-long impacts. No other activity on a dairy farm will yield a higher return on time invested.

Our dairy cows have a high need for dietary calcium. Turnips, due to their calcium scavenging capacity, are an excellent source of calcium. We have tested turnip leaf at 3.5% calcium and bulbs at 1+% calcium. To put this in perspective, ryegrass averages around 0.3% calcium. We cannot feed anywhere near our cows calcium requirement via limestone in grain mixes.", "Calcium is critical to virtually every metabolic function within a cow, especially immune function; let alone what she ships out on the milk tanker daily. We have learnt from experience, an enhanced calcium intake in dry and springer cows has profound influence on fertility. When the dry/springer cow\u2019s calcium requirement has been met, we have recorded, on multiple occasions, rises from 30% conception on first insemination to 65% conception on first insemination. This is a staggering increase, and following on from January\u2019s article on pregnancy rates, and their equal influence on farm profit to feed availability, calcium nutrition cannot be ignored.", "Restoring forage, or forage species high in calcium is a must for cow health and performance, but we will gain in soil health and performance also. Turnips are a seasonal opportunity for dietary calcium intake, restoration of clover in pasture swards will benefit ryegrass production as well as increasing calcium content in grazed pasture. We have severely degraded our soils over the last forty years, especially with excessive use of urea, and to my observation, diminishing benefit, partially through depleted sulphur reserves, but also reducing soil pH.", "To compound the soil acidification problem, we have also compacted soils further reducing their productive capacity.

Based on the Australian 305 day lactation average milk production, clearly we are underfeeding our cows by at least 4+ kgs DM daily. We have bred cows through genetic advancement that have far greater capacity for converting feed dollars to milk dollars, yet we have not taken advantage of our investment in genetics when our national average milk production is half that of the USA.", "I\u2019ve been told for 40 years we are a different industry from the USA. Problem is; we are competing on the same world markets against more efficient milk production systems. Further, cows are cows and feed is feed, irrespective of delivery system; grazed or TMR. Producing more milk from the same fixed costs (land and cow maintenance energy cost), increases our competitiveness, but more so, our profit.", "Having the feed to optimise our cows\u2019 capacity for converting it to milk dollars is a multifaceted issue we\u2019ll look more closely at next month under the heading of Feed Budgeting. Suffice to say, as all my consultancy clients know, number one is allowing cows access to feed per se. From there we look to planning the growing of forages that are highly digestible. We can fill a cow to contentment with hay, but she will not convert that hay to much milk. Worse still, the conversion of hay dollars to milk dollars is not profitable due mostly to very slow digestibility rates that limit daily dry matter intakes.", "From here we look at energy and protein densities. How much energy and protein is in each kg of dry matter consumed by our cow. She has a physical limit to DM feed intake, so the higher the energy and protein in each kg DM of feed, the higher the total energy/protein intake will be, and obviously, how much milk she will produce daily.", "We run a ratio in our diet analysis program of energy to maintenance and production. This ratio is critical in determining feed cost per litre of milk produced. Further, as this ratio shifts according to feed intake, digestibility and energy density, the cost of producing a litre of milk rises or falls rapidly. There is a multiplier effect occurring in the shifts of this ratio; for better or worse.", "Feed intake, digestibility and energy/protein density are the \u2018macros\u2019 of dairy nutrition and production. However, the next plane is mineral nutrition. Our forages are a \u2018mixed bag\u2019 of minerals, some excessive and some deficient. For example, our forages tend to be between excessive, and highly excessive in potassium \u2013 fertilizer dependant. Our cows have a massive requirement for calcium, and pastures are very low in calcium; likewise, magnesium. It is essential we supplement our cows to regulate excesses and supply deficiencies. Cows also have a high salt requirement.", "Next we need to consider trace minerals. Although they are supplemented in very small amounts, they are highly essential to many biological functions of dairy cows, including our opening claim of feed, fertility and lameness. Trace minerals are not very bioavailable from plant tissue, and hence must be supplemented via mineral premixes in grain.", "Following are the critical roles of commonly supplemented trace minerals and vitamins. Copper, Manganese and Zinc play important roles in protein synthesis, vitamin metabolism, the growth of ligaments and immune function. Cobalt is essential to B12 vitamin production in the rumen, and if not limited, will supply all the cows\u2019 need for B12. Vitamins A & D are commonly supplemented despite their natural availability from green forages and sunlight respectively, to ensure no compromised requirement.", "There are two other essential supplements that I have left until we look at fertility, as they are critical to that major profit driver. They are; the trace mineral selenium and vitamin E. Both have vital roles in uterine health the therefore fertility. Further, both are antioxidants which have important roles in stabilising fatty acids and soluble vitamins. Their role in reducing toxicity of fats is very significant in our grazing based system as pasture has very high fat. The obvious sign of excessive dietary fats from pasture is suppressed BF%. Antioxidants also prevent the formation of free radicals affecting digestion of feeds and animal health.", "Fertility then becomes a natural and serendipitous outcome of a fresh cow that has not suffered excessive negative energy balance from underfeeding, or pre-calving nutrition, has her mineral and vitamin requirements met, and then, a healthy and vital uterus. The one issue that can decimate all the above, is lameness.", "Lameness prevention has specific nutritional needs, all of which are mentioned above related to milk production and fertility. However, to highlight a few very necessary preventative measures, we ensure adequate zinc is fed for formation of sound hoof material. Limit weight loss post-calving which can reduce the fat pad and its \u2018shock-absorber\u2019 function in the heel, and of course, feed buffering agents and adequate effective fibre for good rumen health and mitigation of sub-optimal ruminal pH (SARA).", "Supplementing Biotin in mineral mixes added to grain has significant benefits to hoof integrity.", "Addressing environmental causes to lameness such as track maintenance, minimising sharp turns on concrete (exiting rotary platforms especially) or covering with rubber mats will reduce injury and ware to hooves. Applying zinc sulphate and copper sulphate solutions alternately via absorbent mats while exiting dairies are beneficial in drying and hardening soles during wet conditions, reducing risk of stone punctures and bruising.", "Despite our best efforts in all the above, I cannot stress enough that failed transition nutrition, which I\u2019ve written on numerous times over the past few months, will severely reduce our ability to enhance our cows\u2019 capacity for profitable lactations through feed, fertility and the absence of lameness. A recent report highlighted the fresh cow\u2019s energy need as being similar to a human running two marathons daily.

Effectively, feed dollars converted to milk dollars for this is the real determinant of profit.", "That\u2019s the simple equation, but from there on it can become quite complicated by debates over the cost of grass, by rates of digestibility (a subject I want to address next month), and by rumen health/function or feed conversion efficiency. We will leave these complications out of this discussion as my goal is to drive forage production on farm to at least validate the mantra of home grown feeds being the cheapest.", "Home grown forage may or may not be the cheapest forage, but grain generally stands alone on energy cost. Home grown forage cost depends heavily on the value of the land it is grown on, the yield per annum per hectare, its digestibility and energy density. For our regular monthly clients we can determine grass grazed in tonnes of dry matter (TDM) and collate monthly averages for the full year. We can add to this quite accurately TDM silage, measure summer crops and cost each out. Due to wide variations between farms on the above criteria, we choose to take a mean value for grazed pasture at $250/TDM. This gives us a basis for silage cost, and good comparative data within farms from year to year.", "I believe the district average for SW Victoria is in the vicinity 4 to 4.5 TDM/ha pasture harvested (machine or grazed). Yet we are aware of farms where we have measurement from monthly consumption, harvesting 10 TDM/ha and higher. Obviously, there is a massive difference in pasture cost irrespective of additional input cost to achieve this high TDM/ha. There usually is a serendipitous increase in digestibility with higher yielding farms, and this only magnifies the feed to milk dollar conversion potential/profit.", "I raise this subject each year around July/August as that is when we prepare Feed Budgets for our clients. It is the most-timely part of the season to do so, so we can plan summer forage crops types/hectares etc., estimate silage requirements including our goal of 50% extra for reserves, based on the previous year\u2019s forage harvested over each farm. Solid silage reserves can insulate us significantly from the many vagaries of season, grain and milk price we are subject to these days. Achieving these silage reserves also come under our summer cropping program with crops such as sorghum.", "Over many years of preparing Feed Budgets for clients, compounded by observations, we have come to realise some of the limitations to home grown forage production. Things like compaction \u2013 pasture plants pulled up by grazing cows due to shallow rooting. Declining plant densities, and falling yields which are now known to be associated with lack of rotational crops. Differing plant species remove and deposit different things in soil, but all contribute to improved yields. There are synergies to yield through plant rotations. To resolve these impediments to yield we developed a Seven Year Paddock Plan for each of our clients. The goal is to address the above limitations, improve soil health/organic matter and yield capacity. The basic idea is two years in crops, up to three crops per year, then back to pasture for five years.", "We believe, based on overseas data, that we can increase home grown forage harvested and hence lower the cost of feed, or rather, the cost of energy harvested/ha, through crop rotations. This principle has been known and practiced, especially by cereal grows, for many years. Both land (due to land value), and cows (due to maintenance energy cost), have fixed costs that can only be diluted to the benefit of profit, by increased yield \u2013 either TDM/ha or litres/cow.", "Our potential to achieve this in our dairying areas is massive. The next \u2018big thing\u2019, we believe. We have clients that have achieved dramatically increased TDM harvested over their farms simply through summer fodder crop programs. We are now taking that to a new level with a more holistic plan spanning seven years. Our goals include improving soil health/productivity through rotational crops, addressing soil compaction, initially mechanically, but further through selecting deep rooted crops. Deep ripping has questions over its effectiveness in the longer term, and possible damage to soil structure, but can certainly open ground to facilitate deeper rooting of crops/plants immediately following.", "Rotational cropping has added potential to increase soil organic matter, an issue we think has deteriorated our dairy land\u2019s productivity over the last fifty years. The benefits of increased organic matter on an organic farm we work with showcase this potential. This organic farm nowadays would out yield many conventional farms and has a per cow milk production average 60% higher than the national average.", "Crop root systems deposit organic matter in soils. Likewise, stubble from crops, although nitrogen must be available to breakdown residue or new seedlings will suffer retarded growth until plant residue has been broken down. A clover crop through winter can provide excellent high calcium silage for dry and springing cows, but also increase soil N for the following summer crop. We have measured very high turnip yields following a winter clover crop.", "Overseas research has demonstrated reduced weed and pest problems through rotational crop programs. As with antibiotics in treating disease/infections in cows, we will be restricted in the use of these and plant protection chemicals in the very near future. Garden enthusiasts know well that various plants protect and encourage growth in other plants. We need to return our farms to more natural biology, and I\u2019m confident we can do so and increase our profitability.", "Calcium is essential for mineral movement in soils, making them available to plants, and for the same reason in cows\u2019 digestive systems. The application of lime to farms has deteriorated dramatically over my lifetime. I suspect this too has reduced our soil\u2019s capacity to support vibrant plant growth, apart from soil pH.", "The last twelve months has shocked us all, both farmers and the service industry.

When I started share farming in the early \u201c70\u2019s\u201d, costs, including finance costs, were benchmarked at 30% of farm income.", "The range of margins across farms has always been variable in line with management and debt, multiplied by a whole raft of variables beyond farmer control. We tend to focus far too much on the influences over which we have no control, weather and milk price being the dominant stressors. This leaves us with influences that are within our control.", "I\u2019ve have written many times, the two drivers of farm profit are feed and fertility. Feed drives milk production and income, and fertility drives a herd\u2019s capacity to utilize feed in conversion to milk. This is determined by a herd\u2019s average days-in-milk. Obviously the more fresh cows we have in a herd the higher the milk production will be, provided feed is offered to enable our cow to consume to capacity. This is compounded by cows in early lactation possessing greater feed conversion efficiency.", "Below these two pillars of farm profitability lay a variety of \u2018foundational\u2019 issues we do have control over, to a large degree. Whenever I go to my banks teller machine to draw cash, it comes up with a statement that 37% of farmers, or a similar, agree agtech is the way of the future. I would question this statement.

We track a number of performance indicators on our clients\u2019 farms around feeding efficiency. As any of my nagged clients will tell you I get highly repetitive, especially on dry matter intake, as the key to all else. None of the indicators we study are visible through normal accounting analysis of farm businesses, and therefore, pass under the radar completely unknown, evaporating the gap between feed cost and milk income.", "Although the sick cow is thought to be visible, with improved nutrition, especially in transition, clinical milk fever rates have plummeted over the last twenty years. This is very positive, but research knows full well, as is often the case in life, the visible issues were only the tip of the iceberg. Subclinical disease is by far the greatest thief of farm profit and attracts little interest because of its non-visible status.", "\nThe non-visible, subclinical milk fever, is usually where the \u2018train wreck\u2019 starts, then, precipitates a trail of further metabolic diseases, often referred to as the \u2018cascade effect\u2019 of milk fever. Some of these secondary diseases remain under the radar just holding back our cow from rapidly increasing DM intake immediately post-calving and induce ketosis.", "By now we have a compromised immune system incapable to dealing with pathogen entering the mammary system even under normal farm conditions. Mastitis plays havoc with fertility due to systemic inflammation from mediators sent out by the immune system to address the infection. Immunosuppression enables metritis to establish. Compromised blood calcium status can trigger LDA\u2019s.", "Any or all of these disease scenarios will hamper feed intake, limiting milk production at a stage she was at her greatest potential for whole of lactation production. The likelihood of further disease limitation to both milk production and fertility are high. Subclinical ketosis is well researched as to increase risk factor to other metabolic disease, fertility and recent, although early work at Cornell (USA) indicates ketosis in this lactation will reduce milk production in subsequent lactations, and possibly, whole of life production.", "Transition management has potential to make or break our margins and justifies every effort to micro manage cow nutrition through this phase.

This article is focused on the pregnancy side of this dual profit driver. Once cows have calved, passed through the immediate post-calving phase and hopefully back in-calf, our focus then shifts to next lactation, without compromising the current one.", "As distant as next joining maybe for many farms, our success with pregnancy rates, and viability, begins once our cow is confirmed pregnant this lactation. Planning now, as to how we are going to execute a breeding program, will include decisions regarding heat detection, choice of timed AI or natural presentation, nutrition, both pre and post calving and prevention/management of metabolic disorders at calving. A well-documented plan can contribute very significantly to a successful joining. In fact, these issues are quoted as contributing up to 96% of conception variations.", "Obviously, our cow needs to dry-off in calving BCS. This means, no weight gain or loss during the dry phase. Recent research opinion has stated shorter dry periods (30 to 40 days) do produce earlier first heats and improved fertility. Long dry spells (greater than 100 days) are associated with poorer fertility. From personal experience, you must be very confident of calving dates to optimise shorter dry periods.", "Much has been written, by me and many others, on transition nutrition. Best practice in this area has not changed a great deal for many years, verifying its validity. Maximising dry matter intake of a well-balanced diet fortified with sound mineral balance, calcium especially, and managed for Dietary Cation Anion Difference (DCAD). In regard to fertility, we have seen dramatically improved conception rates under controlled calcium nutrition through both the dry period and transition.", "Sound nutrition and environmental conditions at calving can minimise uterine infection and dystocia which research has identified as possibly causing 60% of lost pregnancies in the first 60 days of gestation. High Rumen Degradable Protein (RDP) diets are also a cause of early fetal death.", "Post-calving metabolic disorders certainly influence fertility and pregnancy rate. Milk fever/ketosis, but far more importantly, sub-clinical milk fever/ketosis, will hand string milk production dramatically, let alone conception. We have for a number of years drenched every cow at calving with propylene glycol, and our testing of milk with ketos test strips has validated this procedure as very effective.", "I am impressed with controlled breeding through timed AI programs. It leaves little to chance and human observation as guidance to breeding, and coupled with 42 day post-insemination pregnancy testing are a powerful tool to manage pregnancy rate. Postnatal vet checks to ensure cows are clean and cycling we\u2019ve done since the 1980\u2019s.", "If farmer insemination is part of either timed AI or natural presentation, much can be said for refresher courses on technique and semen handling. A client of ours attended a fertility course in the USA and was shocked by \u2018marginal\u2019 variations from protocols having significant effect on conception.", "Many farms now use software to manage farm data, but especially breeding details. Most programs are capable of extracting performance data on breeding. This information is essential for review of procedures when less-than-optimum results occur.", "Mastitis between calving and joining is well researched as a cause of conception failure. Mastitis between insemination and 42 days post-insemination has a very high mortality rate on early term pregnancies. Transition nutrition and calving environment play major roles, combined with dry cow therapy and teat seal in minimising post-calving mastitis incidence. Milking machine maintenance has also revealed on several farms its impact in mastitis control.", "Good fertility breeds good fertility, and many other profit benefits. The client with the highest fertility, averaging around 60% conception on one insemination, soon had abundant replacement heifers. Over the last couple of years of high beef prices, and abundant young stock, he has culled ruthlessly, any repeat breeders, repeat mastitis, repeat lameness, and done quite nicely in his beef (culling) marketing enterprise. As one of my sons says; we are beef farmers who milk cows to pay the bills.

Feed, Fertility and Lameness. All three are highly related, outside environmental causes to lameness. So, the answer is YES!", "FEED: As obvious as it may seem, feed and fertility are well research-proven limitations to farm profit. Based on the Australian 305 day lactation average milk production, clearly we are underfeeding our cows by at least 4+ kgs DM daily. We have bred cows through genetic advancement that have far greater capacity for converting feed dollars to milk dollars, yet we have not taken advantage of our investment in genetics when our national average milk production is half that of the USA.", "I\u2019ve been told for 40 years we are a different industry from the USA. Problem is; we are competing on the same world markets against more efficient milk production systems. Further, cows are cows and feed is feed, irrespective of delivery system; grazed or TMR. Producing more milk from the same fixed costs (land and cow maintenance energy cost), increases our competitiveness, but more so, our profit.", "Having the feed to optimise our cows\u2019 capacity for converting it to milk dollars is a multifaceted issue we\u2019ll look more closely at next month under the heading of Feed Budgeting. Suffice to say, as all my consultancy clients know, number one is allowing cows access to feed per se. From there we look to planning the growing of forages that are highly digestible. We can fill a cow to contentment with hay, but she will not convert that hay to much milk. Worse still, the conversion of hay dollars to milk dollars is not profitable due mostly to very slow digestibility rates that limit daily dry matter intakes.", "From here we look at energy and protein densities. How much energy and protein is in each kg of dry matter consumed by our cow. She has a physical limit to DM feed intake, so the higher the energy and protein in each kg DM of feed, the higher the total energy/protein intake will be, and obviously, how much milk she will produce daily.", "We run a ratio in our diet analysis program of energy to maintenance and production. This ratio is critical in determining feed cost per litre of milk produced. Further, as this ratio shifts according to feed intake, digestibility and energy density, the cost of producing a litre of milk rises or falls rapidly. There is a multiplier effect occurring in the shifts of this ratio; for better or worse.", "Feed intake, digestibility and energy/protein density are the \u2018macros\u2019 of dairy nutrition and production. However, the next plane is mineral nutrition. Our forages are a \u2018mixed bag\u2019 of minerals, some excessive and some deficient. For example, our forages tend to be between excessive, and highly excessive in potassium \u2013 fertilizer dependant. Our cows have a massive requirement for calcium, and pastures are very low in calcium; likewise, magnesium. It is essential we supplement our cows to regulate excesses and supply deficiencies. Cows also have a high salt requirement.", "Next we need to consider trace minerals. Although they are supplemented in very small amounts, they are highly essential to many biological functions of dairy cows, including our opening claim of feed, fertility and lameness. Trace minerals are not very bioavailable from plant tissue, and hence must be supplemented via mineral premixes in grain.", "Following are the critical roles of commonly supplemented trace minerals and vitamins. Copper, Manganese and Zinc play important roles in protein synthesis, vitamin metabolism, the growth of ligaments and immune function. Cobalt is essential to B12 vitamin production in the rumen, and if not limited, will supply all the cows\u2019 need for B12. Vitamins A & D are commonly supplemented despite their natural availability from green forages and sunlight respectively, to ensure no compromised requirement.", "There are two other essential supplements that I have left until we look at fertility, as they are critical to that major profit driver. They are; the trace mineral selenium and vitamin E. Both have vital roles in uterine health the therefore fertility. Further, both are antioxidants which have important roles in stabilising fatty acids and soluble vitamins. Their role in reducing toxicity of fats is very significant in our grazing based system as pasture has very high fat. The obvious sign of excessive dietary fats from pasture is suppressed BF%. Antioxidants also prevent the formation of free radicals affecting digestion of feeds and animal health.", "Fertility then becomes a natural and serendipitous outcome of a fresh cow that has not suffered excessive negative energy balance from underfeeding, or pre-calving nutrition, has her mineral and vitamin requirements met, and then, a healthy and vital uterus. The one issue that can decimate all the above, is lameness.", "Lameness prevention has specific nutritional needs, all of which are mentioned above related to milk production and fertility. However, to highlight a few very necessary preventative measures, we ensure adequate zinc is fed for formation of sound hoof material. Limit weight loss post-calving which can reduce the fat pad and its \u2018shock-absorber\u2019 function in the heel, and of course, feed buffering agents and adequate effective fibre for good rumen health and mitigation of sub-optimal ruminal pH (SARA).", "Supplementing Biotin in mineral mixes added to grain has significant benefits to hoof integrity.", "Addressing environmental causes to lameness such as track maintenance, minimising sharp turns on concrete (exiting rotary platforms especially) or covering with rubber mats will reduce injury and ware to hooves. Applying zinc sulphate and copper sulphate solutions alternately via absorbent mats while exiting dairies are beneficial in drying and hardening soles during wet conditions, reducing risk of stone punctures and bruising.", "Despite our best efforts in all the above, I cannot stress enough that failed transition nutrition, which I\u2019ve written on numerous times over the past few months, will severely reduce our ability to enhance our cows\u2019 capacity for profitable lactations through feed, fertility and the absence of lameness.

Nothing else in farm technology or practice has endured misinformation than silage inoculants have. There would be very few, if any products/additives in farming that has attracted more research and validation than the use of silage inoculants. There is general agreement from multiple research facilities that silage inoculants can return as high as 15 to 1 on investment, improve dry matter recovery by 2 to 6 percent and improve animal performance by 3 to 5 percent. This is pretty heavy validation. Yet the uptake of this valuable technology is still limited in Australia.", "Why? Firstly there are the complete sceptics that believe silage inoculants are simply a sales con. Secondly there is the erroneous belief that you only use silage inoculants when weather or other negative factors come into play. The truth is, silage inoculants make good silage better, but cannot improve poor silage or methods. I do hasten to add one benefit, and it a very significant one; high quality lactic acid bacterial inoculants will, in the presence of adequate moisture, make the silage very palatable. This past spring produced abundant evidence of this. A wet spring and very mature silage, often low in nutrient value, but when inoculated with a quality lactic acid bacterial inoculant produced sweet palatable silage that cows still happily consumed. Wastage at feed-out will always be the biggest cost to silage.", "Baled silage versus stacks", "This debate has raged for as long as I have been involved in dairy farming. The short answer is neither is better. Both suffer various procedural practices that can discount the value of the silage when fed. Harvest method and storage system choice relates more to individual farm preferences that often are determined by infrastructure, both for making and feed-out, herd size, the choice of contractor or on farm labour and personal choice and management style.", "Heat in silage", "There are two misconceptions common related to heat in silage. The first is, heat is necessary to \u2018cook\u2019 the silage. The second is, heat is bad in silage. Both are wrong. The first clearly wrong!", "Cooking and fermentation are two different methods of food preservation. Cooking, as in heat, destroys silage, more shortly. Second; some heat is normal. There are two types of heat in silage: 1) physiological heat from plant respiration. This is normal and necessary for fermentation bacteria to thrive and can produce temperatures from 32 C to 43 C. Silage will then settle around 5 C above ambient temperature at ensiling time.", "The second heat source is microbial in origin, and caused by aerobic organisms such as yeasts and moulds. This is bad heat as it can reach 60 C using up energy and destroying protein (Maillard Reaction \u2013 the cause of haystack fires). There are several strategies to prevent this kind of heat in good management practices (more below), but the best insurance against microbial heat is a quality silage inoculant. It will limit yeasts and moulds, and should be an OH&S requirement to protect farmers and employees from inhaling toxic moulds when handling silage at feed-out. Let alone cow health and productivity.", "Compaction", "Poor compaction is the major cause of baled silage going out of shape; not high moisture as is commonly believed. Nor is it caused by baling silage \u2018too green\u2019, a description very common but has no research or scientific definition to verify this description. Fermentation is an anaerobic process \u2013 no oxygen. Oxygen is No. 1 enemy of silage.", "Belts on balers should be under such tension that the pressure gauge is in the red. Only worn belts break. Chopping, either by knives on balers, pickup wagons or forage harvesters should be compulsory. Nothing will aid compaction/oxygen expulsion and produce excellent fermentation like chopped forage. Offer your bale contractor $2 extra per bale to chop (it does slow down baling and use more diesel) and your silage bill will be cheaper (5 bales into 4 \u2013 compaction).", "Packing procedure on stacks is essential to avoid bridging once layer thickness increases. Bridging distributes pack tractor weight outward rather than downwards. Less downward pressure reduces air expulsion.", "Shrinkage", "A term not common on the silage discussion list. Pile or bale shrinkage relates to the above compaction discussion and is due to uncontrolled fermentation as a result of silage not reaching a stable pH. Again, quality silage inoculants have major benefits in achieving stable silage and preventing this form of shrinkage in the presence of well compacted silage.", "The shrinkage I\u2019m thinking of here is the calculation of the tonnage of silage made less the tonnage fed. A 4 x 4 bale of silage has a market value around $90. It also contains around 250 kgs dry matter irrespective of its actual weight (water content varies). So that is $360/TDM \u2013 about $100/TDM more than wheat. Wastage at feed-out is researched as 20% at best when fed in the paddock. Wastage then costs $72/TDM, taking our bale to $162. Feed pads also have wastage in varying degrees. The best method to reduce wastage is palatability, and the best method to ensure palatability is a quality lactic acid bacterial silage inoculant. Shrinkage and/or wastage do not receive the attention they rightly deserve.", "\u00a0", "Silage has become a staple component of dairy cow diets virtually year round.

Few inoculants in Australia contain bacteria with EU registration as proof of their effectiveness. The third bacteria is Propionibacterium freudenreichii for the purpose of producing preservative propionic acid in silage. The two upfront bacteria will lower silage pH very rapidly stabilising it and preventing further fermentation from damaging both quality and dry matter.", "Bacterial inoculants contain freeze dried bacteria which are activated when in contact with moisture. As live bacteria, stability and survival rates of bacteria are critical to the inoculant\u2019s effectiveness in silage. Again, EU registration requires evidence of product stability. Obviously silage inoculants that do not have EU registered bacteria can, and do, produce a variety of fermentation outcomes as differing bacterial species are common in an unregulated Australian market.", "Pasture Gold also contains an enzyme pack (fibre-technology) to increase silage digestibility. The science of enzymes in silage inoculant has now been reproduced in additives for mixer wagons that involve un-inoculated silage or hays and other forages or fibrous ingredients. Enzymes break down indigestible fibre (lignin), converting it to sugars that lactic acid bacteria then convert to lactic acid. Lactic acid is 10 times stronger than other fermentation acids and lowers pH rapidly to stability. This exposes increased digestible fibre to rumen bacteria for nutrient extraction and cow nutrition.", "Perhaps the greatest financial return from Pasture Gold is the abundance of lactic acid. Lactic acid is very palatable to cows. This ensures high intakes, but perhaps even more important, very little wastage. Silage wastage at feed-out is by far the greatest cost to silage as a feed in conversion to milk dollars. This wastage is the greater part of what is known as shrinkage.

It is also a tension, that is, too fast from very lush pasture or sub-optimal rumen pH, will reduce feed conversion efficiency and increase feed cost per litre significantly, not to mention cow health. Our valuable feed ends up in manure pats in the paddock instead of milk in the vat. Alternately, high fibre feeds such as poor quality/mature silage or hay, will slow down rate-of-passage of feed through the digestive tract, reducing daily feed intake and crashing milk production. In both cases, the feed cost per litre will escalate.", "The starting point is always cows\u2019 access to sufficient feed to be fully fed. Then there are two states of being \u2018fully fed\u2019. Full to contentment, and physically gut fill. Obviously physical gut fill is the goal of optimum milk production, reduced cost per litre from dilution of maintenance energy cost, and maximised profit which usually is accompanied by cow health.", "Assuming cows do have access to sufficient feed, which is not common outside spring, the next limitation is palatability. Feed, be it pasture, summer crops, silage, grain or anything else, must first be highly palatable to achieve potential feed intake. Now back to rate-of-passage.", "High fibre feeds spend long periods in the rumen being broken down sufficiently to pass into the abomasum, the true stomach. This reduces rate-of-passage to the extent that feed intake is also reduced with consequent reduction in milk production, higher feed cost per litre, as above, maintenance energy cost per litre, all culminating, and by a multiplier effect, in a crash in profit.", "Feed NDF% (Neutral Detergent Fibre \u2013 total fibre in any given feed or ration), really does not tell us much as far as predicting milk production and profit from this feed or ration. Digestibility is the key.", "Good feed analysis laboratories will supply 24 hr, 30 hr and 240 hr digestibility rates for feeds submitted for testing. Although there is some debate among academics as to which, 24 or 30 hr digestibility rates, are best to predict milk outcomes, my simplistic understanding prefers the 24 hr digestibility data. Why? Because we all work on 24 hr milk production systems to inform us as to how we are producing.", "The 24 hr digestibility is telling us how much fibre is still in the rumen from yesterday, and how much that is going to reduce our cow\u2019s feed intake today; and her milk production/profit.", "Let\u2019s look at two examples of pasture from our feed test library: 1) Actively growing/short rotation ryegrass \u2013 24 hr digestibility 81.48%, sampled in June 17. 2) Slow growing/long rotation ryegrass \u2013 24 hr digestibility 51.73%, sampled in November 16.", "If we fed 10 kgs DM (dry matter) of each pasture to two groups of cows the difference in ryegrass digested and converted to milk would be 1) 8.148 kgs DM, 2) 5.173 kgs DM. Now, to compound the issue, the quality pasture has an ME (energy value) of 10.26 MJME/kg DM. The mature ryegrass has an ME of 9.18 MJME/kg DM.", "Now, our cows digesting 8.148 kgs DM of the quality 10 kg DM pasture would convert that to 14.9 lts of milk. The cows consuming 10 kgs DM of the mature pasture and digesting only 5.173 kgs DM would convert that to 8.48 litres of milk. There is $1.57 difference in milk production at 40c/lt between each group of cows! Essentially, $1.57 difference in profit.", "The plot thickens: The group of cows consuming the quality pasture will have 1.852 kgs DM fibre still in their rumens tomorrow reducing their feed intake for tomorrow and limiting tomorrow\u2019s milk production by 3.39 lts. The cows consuming the mature pasture will have 4.827 kgs DM fibre remaining in their rumens tomorrow. This reduces their feed intake tomorrow and reduces milk production by 7.91 lts.", "Yes this is an extreme example for the purpose of highlighting the influence of 24 hr digestibility, as no forage fibre is 100% digestible in 24 hrs. The lesson stands nevertheless, and has devastating impacts on farm profit from not managing grazing particularly, but even worse, time/maturity stage of cutting pasture for silage\u2019s impact on 24 hr digestibility. We have silage test data on hand with variations in 24 hr digestibility between 77% and 49%.", "The Remedies", "Pasture: Short rotations of actively growing and regularly re-pastured stands. This is easily done with strategic fertilizer applications and produces healthy plants. Healthy pasture plants then produce healthy soils, there is a synergy here between these two, but it starts with healthy and actively growing plants. A system proven to achieve this is light applications of a complete blend after every grazing \u2013 21 days. Fertilizer can be reduced once soils are health and vital. Fertilizer is always the cheapest feed!", "Silage: As above, maturity at cutting is number one. Time between cutting and ensiling is number two (see our article \u2018Silage in a Day\u2019 sept 15). Third is a quality lactic acid bacterial silage inoculant containing a proven enzyme pack. Enzymes will break down indigestible fibre converting it to sugars for lactic acid producing bacteria to convert to lactic acid \u2013 high palatability/silage intake. This reduction in indigestible fibre will increase 24 hr digestibility and milk production from each kg DM of silage.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "As a general statement, few would dispute home grown feeds are cheapest. However, we need to look at this more closely. Should we talk just feeds per se, or energy? It is energy we convert to milk. We should be discussing the cost of energy in any given feed when deciding what is cheapest. Effectively, feed dollars converted to milk dollars for this is the real determinant of profit.", "That\u2019s the simple equation, but from there on it can become quite complicated by debates over the cost of grass, by rates of digestibility (a subject I want to address next month), and by rumen health/function or feed conversion efficiency. We will leave these complications out of this discussion as my goal is to drive forage production on farm to at least validate the mantra of home grown feeds being the cheapest.", "Home grown forage may or may not be the cheapest forage, but grain generally stands alone on energy cost. Home grown forage cost depends heavily on the value of the land it is grown on, the yield per annum per hectare, its digestibility and energy density. For our regular monthly clients we can determine grass grazed in tonnes of dry matter (TDM) and collate monthly averages for the full year. We can add to this quite accurately TDM silage, measure summer crops and cost each out. Due to wide variations between farms on the above criteria, we choose to take a mean value for grazed pasture at $250/TDM. This gives us a basis for silage cost, and good comparative data within farms from year to year.", "I believe the district average for SW Victoria is in the vicinity 4 to 4.5 TDM/ha pasture harvested (machine or grazed). Yet we are aware of farms where we have measurement from monthly consumption, harvesting 10 TDM/ha and higher. Obviously, there is a massive difference in pasture cost irrespective of additional input cost to achieve this high TDM/ha. There usually is a serendipitous increase in digestibility with higher yielding farms, and this only magnifies the feed to milk dollar conversion potential/profit.", "I raise this subject each year around July/August as that is when we prepare Feed Budgets for our clients. It is the most-timely part of the season to do so, so we can plan summer forage crops types/hectares etc., estimate silage requirements including our goal of 50% extra for reserves, based on the previous year\u2019s forage harvested over each farm. Solid silage reserves can insulate us significantly from the many vagaries of season, grain and milk price we are subject to these days. Achieving these silage reserves also come under our summer cropping program with crops such as sorghum.", "Over many years of preparing Feed Budgets for clients, compounded by observations, we have come to realise some of the limitations to home grown forage production. Things like compaction \u2013 pasture plants pulled up by grazing cows due to shallow rooting. Declining plant densities, and falling yields which are now known to be associated with lack of rotational crops. Differing plant species remove and deposit different things in soil, but all contribute to improved yields. There are synergies to yield through plant rotations. To resolve these impediments to yield we developed a Seven Year Paddock Plan for each of our clients. The goal is to address the above limitations, improve soil health/organic matter and yield capacity. The basic idea is two years in crops, up to three crops per year, then back to pasture for five years.", "We believe, based on overseas data, that we can increase home grown forage harvested and hence lower the cost of feed, or rather, the cost of energy harvested/ha, through crop rotations. This principle has been known and practiced, especially by cereal grows, for many years. Both land (due to land value), and cows (due to maintenance energy cost), have fixed costs that can only be diluted to the benefit of profit, by increased yield \u2013 either TDM/ha or litres/cow.", "Our potential to achieve this in our dairying areas is massive. The next \u2018big thing\u2019, we believe. We have clients that have achieved dramatically increased TDM harvested over their farms simply through summer fodder crop programs. We are now taking that to a new level with a more holistic plan spanning seven years. Our goals include improving soil health/productivity through rotational crops, addressing soil compaction, initially mechanically, but further through selecting deep rooted crops. Deep ripping has questions over its effectiveness in the longer term, and possible damage to soil structure, but can certainly open ground to facilitate deeper rooting of crops/plants immediately following.", "Rotational cropping has added potential to increase soil organic matter, an issue we think has deteriorated our dairy land\u2019s productivity over the last fifty years. The benefits of increased organic matter on an organic farm we work with showcase this potential. This organic farm nowadays would out yield many conventional farms and has a per cow milk production average 60% higher than the national average.", "Crop root systems deposit organic matter in soils. Likewise, stubble from crops, although nitrogen must be available to breakdown residue or new seedlings will suffer retarded growth until plant residue has been broken down. A clover crop through winter can provide excellent high calcium silage for dry and springing cows, but also increase soil N for the following summer crop. We have measured very high turnip yields following a winter clover crop.", "Overseas research has demonstrated reduced weed and pest problems through rotational crop programs. As with antibiotics in treating disease/infections in cows, we will be restricted in the use of these and plant protection chemicals in the very near future. Garden enthusiasts know well that various plants protect and encourage growth in other plants. We need to return our farms to more natural biology, and I\u2019m confident we can do so and increase our profitability.", "Calcium is essential for mineral movement in soils, making them available to plants, and for the same reason in cows\u2019 digestive systems. The application of lime to farms has deteriorated dramatically over my lifetime. I suspect this too has reduced our soil\u2019s capacity to support vibrant plant growth, apart from soil pH.", "The last twelve months has shocked us all, both farmers and the service industry.

Further, follow-up research on calves fed higher levels of fat and protein during their early weeks of life does enhance adult milk production. Setbacks in the early life of the calf have been well documented as having lifetime production legacies. This more recent research on mammary development may well shed light on why.", "In an earlier article we looked at refractometers to ensure solids content of calf milk was a \u2018known\u2019, rather than a hope. Research on early calf nutrition compared feeding 0.5 kg milk solids to feeding 1 kg milk solids. The calves fed 1 kg of milk solids had double the weight of the mammary gland. It was also found that this weight gain was spread between the fat pad (the supportive tissue in the mammary gland) and \u2018functional\u2019 tissue: a fivefold increase in the fat pad and a sevenfold increase in \u2018functional\u2019 tissue. Further investigation of the tissues involved revealed no reduction in DNA, essential for gene expression. This means, through higher milk solids intakes, calves can increase functional mammary tissue mass without altering its composition, and hence it\u2019s later life function.", "The impetus for this research grew from feeding strategies aimed at increased growth rates in calves; an obviously beneficial goal. However, concern grew as to possible detrimental effects on adult milk production from the possibility of development of fat deposits that may inhibit milk yield, as is common in heifers calving beyond 24 months or overweight, and cows after long dry periods.", "This is a \u201cwin/win\u201d scenario.

Feed, Fertility and Lameness. All three are highly related, outside environmental causes to lameness. So, the answer is YES!", "FEED: As obvious as it may seem, feed and fertility are well research-proven limitations to farm profit. Based on the Australian 305 day lactation average milk production, clearly we are underfeeding our cows by at least 4+ kgs DM daily. We have bred cows through genetic advancement that have far greater capacity for converting feed dollars to milk dollars, yet we have not taken advantage of our investment in genetics when our national average milk production is half that of the USA.", "I\u2019ve been told for 40 years we are a different industry from the USA. Problem is; we are competing on the same world markets against more efficient milk production systems. Further, cows are cows and feed is feed, irrespective of delivery system; grazed or TMR. Producing more milk from the same fixed costs (land and cow maintenance energy cost), increases our competitiveness, but more so, our profit.", "Having the feed to optimise our cows\u2019 capacity for converting it to milk dollars is a multifaceted issue we\u2019ll look more closely at next month under the heading of Feed Budgeting. Suffice to say, as all my consultancy clients know, number one is allowing cows access to feed per se. From there we look to planning the growing of forages that are highly digestible. We can fill a cow to contentment with hay, but she will not convert that hay to much milk. Worse still, the conversion of hay dollars to milk dollars is not profitable due mostly to very slow digestibility rates that limit daily dry matter intakes.", "From here we look at energy and protein densities. How much energy and protein is in each kg of dry matter consumed by our cow. She has a physical limit to DM feed intake, so the higher the energy and protein in each kg DM of feed, the higher the total energy/protein intake will be, and obviously, how much milk she will produce daily.", "We run a ratio in our diet analysis program of energy to maintenance and production. This ratio is critical in determining feed cost per litre of milk produced. Further, as this ratio shifts according to feed intake, digestibility and energy density, the cost of producing a litre of milk rises or falls rapidly. There is a multiplier effect occurring in the shifts of this ratio; for better or worse.", "Feed intake, digestibility and energy/protein density are the \u2018macros\u2019 of dairy nutrition and production. However, the next plane is mineral nutrition. Our forages are a \u2018mixed bag\u2019 of minerals, some excessive and some deficient. For example, our forages tend to be between excessive, and highly excessive in potassium \u2013 fertilizer dependant. Our cows have a massive requirement for calcium, and pastures are very low in calcium; likewise, magnesium. It is essential we supplement our cows to regulate excesses and supply deficiencies. Cows also have a high salt requirement.", "Next we need to consider trace minerals. Although they are supplemented in very small amounts, they are highly essential to many biological functions of dairy cows, including our opening claim of feed, fertility and lameness. Trace minerals are not very bioavailable from plant tissue, and hence must be supplemented via mineral premixes in grain.", "Following are the critical roles of commonly supplemented trace minerals and vitamins. Copper, Manganese and Zinc play important roles in protein synthesis, vitamin metabolism, the growth of ligaments and immune function. Cobalt is essential to B12 vitamin production in the rumen, and if not limited, will supply all the cows\u2019 need for B12. Vitamins A & D are commonly supplemented despite their natural availability from green forages and sunlight respectively, to ensure no compromised requirement.", "There are two other essential supplements that I have left until we look at fertility, as they are critical to that major profit driver. They are; the trace mineral selenium and vitamin E. Both have vital roles in uterine health the therefore fertility. Further, both are antioxidants which have important roles in stabilising fatty acids and soluble vitamins. Their role in reducing toxicity of fats is very significant in our grazing based system as pasture has very high fat. The obvious sign of excessive dietary fats from pasture is suppressed BF%. Antioxidants also prevent the formation of free radicals affecting digestion of feeds and animal health.", "Fertility then becomes a natural and serendipitous outcome of a fresh cow that has not suffered excessive negative energy balance from underfeeding, or pre-calving nutrition, has her mineral and vitamin requirements met, and then, a healthy and vital uterus. The one issue that can decimate all the above, is lameness.", "Lameness prevention has specific nutritional needs, all of which are mentioned above related to milk production and fertility. However, to highlight a few very necessary preventative measures, we ensure adequate zinc is fed for formation of sound hoof material. Limit weight loss post-calving which can reduce the fat pad and its \u2018shock-absorber\u2019 function in the heel, and of course, feed buffering agents and adequate effective fibre for good rumen health and mitigation of sub-optimal ruminal pH (SARA).", "Supplementing Biotin in mineral mixes added to grain has significant benefits to hoof integrity.", "Addressing environmental causes to lameness such as track maintenance, minimising sharp turns on concrete (exiting rotary platforms especially) or covering with rubber mats will reduce injury and ware to hooves. Applying zinc sulphate and copper sulphate solutions alternately via absorbent mats while exiting dairies are beneficial in drying and hardening soles during wet conditions, reducing risk of stone punctures and bruising.", "Despite our best efforts in all the above, I cannot stress enough that failed transition nutrition, which I\u2019ve written on numerous times over the past few months, will severely reduce our ability to enhance our cows\u2019 capacity for profitable lactations through feed, fertility and the absence of lameness. A recent report highlighted the fresh cow\u2019s energy need as being similar to a human running two marathons daily. Nothing impacts post-calving energy (feed intake) like transition nutrition.", "Nutrition provides a massive \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 from dry-off to pregnancy for highly profitable dairy business.", "\u00a0", "Preventative Management for Calf Health", "The foundations of calf health are colostrum, nutrition and environment. The timeframe which impacts whole-of-life productivity is the first week, and these two are intimately connected \u2013 health and productivity. Investment in genetics can be futile and obliterated in this first week; colostrum being the key ingredient for not just immunity, but activation of genes responsible for lifetime productivity.", "Colostrum, we\u2019ve dealt with in previous articles. Nutrition likewise, in our article on refractometers and ensuring calves receive sufficient nutrient via milk. Water consumption drives grain intake and rapidly increases the plane of nutrition and growth. Again, dealt with in recent articles.", "Environment now becomes our focus, and planning pre-calving with disease prevention in mind is paramount.", "1) The initial risk our calf faces is being born. Long or assisted births increase the risk of infection due to stress, pain and injury, and may reduce both intake and absorption of colostrum and its inherent immunoglobulin and other \u2018gene activators\u2019 contained in colostrum.", "2) Exposure to pathogens at the birthing site such as salmonella, E. coli, and other infectious organisms of manure origin are common sources of infection, including micro-organisms on the dam\u2019s flank and teats. Calving pads are a wonderful management tool, but sanitation is essential for both calf and dam at calving; both are highly vulnerable at this time. We recommend a spray called Vibrex (Roy 0428 526 581) to sanitize calving areas.", "3) Sanitation of feeding equipment goes without saying, but infrequently done. Even colostrum can be a carrier of infectious organisms. Pasteurization of colostrum is a growing practice in the USA. Feeding of powdered milk replacer can minimise pathogens. This can be cheaper than milk.", "4) Sub-optimal nutrition will expose our calf to immune deficiency or dysfunction. Immunity is an energy hungry process. The most common feeding error is underfeeding. As highlighted in our article on scours, overfeeding is rarely a cause of scours, but infectious organisms are the most common. Our earlier article on refractometers and milk solids intake referenced nutritional requirements for health and growth, consistency being a major.", "Screening as a daily process for signs of illness or ill-thrift with protocols set out on daily sheets will minimise calf failure. It will also highlight weak links in the system. This is imperative if calf rearers are employed staff. It will give them, the satisfaction of a job well done and enable the farm owner to monitor progress and stumbling blocks.", "In the words of Dr Sheila McGuirk DVM University Wisconsin-Madison:", "\u201cDon\u2019t think that detection of disease is just good \u2018calf sense\u2019, a poor appetite or a computer printout.

However, in the wise words of Dr Tom Overton (Cornell University), we need to shift our view of transition from a time of disease threat to one of production/reproduction opportunity.", "The assumption that all is well, based on no, or little clinical milk fever or ketosis, is far from the truth. Any clinical disease at calving is a flag that we have significant sub-clinical issues, and research has verified the financial magnitude of sub-clinical metabolic disease as far more costly. When metabolism is dysfunctional around calving it may not manifest into clinical disease, but sub-clinical disease will reduce production and fertility. Improvements in milk production and fertility are economically significant.", "There are large datasets from commercial herds highlighting both the prevalence of sub-clinical disease and its impact on milk and reproductive performance. Research focus on blood calcium status post-calving show cows with sub-optimal blood calcium one week after calving had twice the displaced abomasum rate, produced 2 to 5 litres less milk and 30% decreased conception rates at first service.", "Research by Ospina et al, 2010 studied high NETA and BHBA (ketosis indicators) levels in transition cows found that 15% of herds with elevated levels was alarm level and could reduce heifer production by 500 lts and mature cows by 300 lts. Over 71 herds involved in this research, 50% were in excess of 15% affected cows.", "Sub-clinical milk fever and ketosis, they usually go together, along with most other transition problems, can be prevented. Anionic lead feeds are a simple answer to sub-clinical milk fever, and managing energy from dry-off to calving will minimise sub-clinical ketosis. Most other transition problems are secondary disease as a result of these two. Both these diseases carry long-term financial consequences.", "We all look for the Silver Bullet that will lift our farms profitability. Reality is, transition can well be that silver bullet, but it requires attention to less obvious details. Simple things like a change in forage of the springer cow ration can throw the ration DCAD out significantly, and suddenly we have cows down at worst, but also unknown sub-clinical disease from an equally unknown change in forage potassium level.", "Profits won or lost around transition are major due to lactation-long impacts. No other activity on a dairy farm will yield a higher return on time invested. Checking urine pH of springer cows at least weekly and adjusting the anionic lead feed grain fed to restore the correct pH will virtually eliminate sub-clinical milk fever. Checking fresh cow\u2019s milk with a milk keto test strip at day three post-calving and drenching anything in excess of a reading of 100 with propylene glycol will likewise virtually eliminate sub-clinical ketosis. Without these two most common calving related diseases, you will not just lift the bar on potential milk production, but also have given fertility a boost.", "The two drivers of farm profit are feed, because it translates to litres and milk dollars, and fertility, because fresh cows convert feed dollars to milk dollars far more efficiently.

Imbalance in both energy and immune system are inevitable at calving; the degree of severity will determine the domino effect this has; being the cascade of metabolic and infectious diseases that can be precipitated from these two crucial functions of our calving cow.", "\nAs stated in earlier articles, my definition of transition extends from dry-off to pregnancy. From dry-off, the nutritional issues will determine our success in timely pregnancy. Dry-off BCS has been reducing over the last ten years as research correlates higher BCS with poor post-calving feed intakes, especially rate of increase. Hormonally driven milk increase, not being met by feed (energy) intake, and the gap widens in overconditioned dry cows in the first few weeks.", "\nNegative energy balance and immune imbalance are intimately related, and our goal as manages is to minimise the severity and duration of both. Failure to meet energy post-calving leads to sub-optimal immunity and the dominos start falling. Immune function is an energy-hungry machine. If cows are quietly fighting sub-infection while dry, then energy becomes a scarce resource immediately at calving due a massive increase demanded by the mamary system, we\u2019ll have a \u2018health\u2019 implosion. This scenario will only amplify the NEB crisis by reducing feed intake at the most critical time. It is well documented, sick cows, either clinical or sub-clinical, lose appetite.", "\nTo understand the magnitude of the increase in energy demand at the point of calving, researches have quantified this shift from 680 gm of glucose precalving to 1.8 kgs immediately post-calving. It almost trebles! The liver works overtime converting substrate from rumination to glucose, plus some help from body fat and protein. This is the tripping point: how much from rumination (feed intake), and how much comes from body reserves. As above, the lighter cow at calving will increase feed intake more rapidly than the heavier cow and hence reduce her reliance on conversion of body fat and protein to meet the mamary system\u2019s demand as milk production escalates.", "\nThe immune system is already under pressure simply from the physical stress of calving. Any other physical stress factors will only multiply the demand on the immune system. Management can play a significant role here in preparitory minimisation of external stressors to our calving cow. Once energy supply becomes an issue, immunity will not cope with normal bacterial exposure at calving, let alone any preconditions, like mastitis. Retained membrane followed by metritis send the immune system into overload and inability to meet infection outbreaks. Again, all this only multiplies the energy issue by reducing feed intake. Here go the dominos!", "\nWe have two lines of health issues from here: infection due to compromised immune function, and metabolic disease due to excessive fat mobilisation, trying to meet the glucose deficiency, creating fatty liver syndrome and soon after, ketosis. Managing energy is the key.", "There is a crisis where normal negative energy balance passes the point of no return. The mediators sent out by the immune system to fight infection also cause inflamation. Inflamation is good to a point. Inflamation is crucial in controlling intial bacterial invasion recruiting immune cells to the site of infection. However, imbalance in the immune system will cause excessive inflamation and incomplete killing of bacteria, pain and swelling for the cow, either external or internal.", "\nInflamation is also very counter to conception. The inflamation in the uterus from a clinical mastitis case will devistate conception or holding of early pregnancies due to physical and chemical changes in uterine mucus. Immune mediators travel via the blood system, so inflamation is systemic.", "\nHow do we manage it?", "\nDry-off in lower BCS than has been customary. Keeping cows milking well up to dry off will enable this. Cows dried off in summer/early autumn can be a problem due to low protein diet at that time of year. It is imperative the dry cow has no weight gain or loss while dry. Either will precipate the reduced feed intake post-claving. Controlling the dry cow diet is easy during late summer early autumn when pasture intake is not a problem. Good quality adlib silage will do the job nicely.", "\nAs discussed in a previous article, 30% to 40% clover must be our pasture goal to meet cows calcium need on top of supplementation in bale feed. Silage made from this pasture mix will also meet the dry cow\u2019s calcium need with significant benefits to immunity, milk protein production and fertility. Controlling energy intake in dry cows once pasture is available requires more monitoring. Adlib hay rings and strip grazing calculating pasture energy intake by monitoring hay consumption and adjusting strip width, is as close as we can get in a grazing system.", "\nThe springer cow diet is, as above, plus 3 or 4 kgs of a good lead feed grain mix including anionic salts. Again, it is imperative we monitor/calculate energy intake. DCAD (Dietary Cation/Anion Difference) is critical to springer cows. This is easily done by checking urine pH several times each week. A pH of 5.5 to 6.5 with Jerseys at the lower end and holsteins toward the other end. Drenching cows at calving with propylene glycol is very successful in mitigating ketosis. We have several clients with computer rotary dairys who administer small doses of propylene glycol to fresh cows for 20 days via the computer.", "\nKetosis status is easily measured with a Milk Keto Test Strip.

Although results were very variable, there certainly was ample evidence of serious soil compaction on many farms. In conjunction with a colleague in the USA who specialises in crop rotations to improve soil productivity, we have been advocating crop systems to this goal, and to increase dry matter harvested from existing farms.", "Our soil compaction problems arise from farm practices of the last fifty years including stocking rates, weight of machinery, and a lack of cropping options in favour of monoculture pasture stands. The loss of clovers from our pastures has had significant effect on compaction due to the lack of clover\u2019s deep rooting. Cropping rotations leave dead root matter in soils breaking down to organic matter, a critical element for soil life.", "Mechanical compaction takes seconds to do, but decades to recover.

This is pretty heavy validation. Yet the uptake of this valuable technology is still limited in Australia.", "Why? Firstly there are the complete sceptics that believe silage inoculants are simply a sales con. Secondly there is the erroneous belief that you only use silage inoculants when weather or other negative factors come into play. The truth is, silage inoculants make good silage better, but cannot improve poor silage or methods. I do hasten to add one benefit, and it a very significant one; high quality lactic acid bacterial inoculants will, in the presence of adequate moisture, make the silage very palatable. This past spring produced abundant evidence of this. A wet spring and very mature silage, often low in nutrient value, but when inoculated with a quality lactic acid bacterial inoculant produced sweet palatable silage that cows still happily consumed. Wastage at feed-out will always be the biggest cost to silage.", "Baled silage versus stacks", "This debate has raged for as long as I have been involved in dairy farming. The short answer is neither is better. Both suffer various procedural practices that can discount the value of the silage when fed. Harvest method and storage system choice relates more to individual farm preferences that often are determined by infrastructure, both for making and feed-out, herd size, the choice of contractor or on farm labour and personal choice and management style.", "Heat in silage", "There are two misconceptions common related to heat in silage. The first is, heat is necessary to \u2018cook\u2019 the silage. The second is, heat is bad in silage. Both are wrong. The first clearly wrong!", "Cooking and fermentation are two different methods of food preservation. Cooking, as in heat, destroys silage, more shortly. Second; some heat is normal. There are two types of heat in silage: 1) physiological heat from plant respiration. This is normal and necessary for fermentation bacteria to thrive and can produce temperatures from 32 C to 43 C. Silage will then settle around 5 C above ambient temperature at ensiling time.", "The second heat source is microbial in origin, and caused by aerobic organisms such as yeasts and moulds. This is bad heat as it can reach 60 C using up energy and destroying protein (Maillard Reaction \u2013 the cause of haystack fires). There are several strategies to prevent this kind of heat in good management practices (more below), but the best insurance against microbial heat is a quality silage inoculant. It will limit yeasts and moulds, and should be an OH&S requirement to protect farmers and employees from inhaling toxic moulds when handling silage at feed-out. Let alone cow health and productivity.", "Compaction", "Poor compaction is the major cause of baled silage going out of shape; not high moisture as is commonly believed. Nor is it caused by baling silage \u2018too green\u2019, a description very common but has no research or scientific definition to verify this description. Fermentation is an anaerobic process \u2013 no oxygen. Oxygen is No. 1 enemy of silage.", "Belts on balers should be under such tension that the pressure gauge is in the red. Only worn belts break. Chopping, either by knives on balers, pickup wagons or forage harvesters should be compulsory. Nothing will aid compaction/oxygen expulsion and produce excellent fermentation like chopped forage. Offer your bale contractor $2 extra per bale to chop (it does slow down baling and use more diesel) and your silage bill will be cheaper (5 bales into 4 \u2013 compaction).", "Packing procedure on stacks is essential to avoid bridging once layer thickness increases. Bridging distributes pack tractor weight outward rather than downwards. Less downward pressure reduces air expulsion.", "Shrinkage", "A term not common on the silage discussion list. Pile or bale shrinkage relates to the above compaction discussion and is due to uncontrolled fermentation as a result of silage not reaching a stable pH. Again, quality silage inoculants have major benefits in achieving stable silage and preventing this form of shrinkage in the presence of well compacted silage.", "The shrinkage I\u2019m thinking of here is the calculation of the tonnage of silage made less the tonnage fed. A 4 x 4 bale of silage has a market value around $90. It also contains around 250 kgs dry matter irrespective of its actual weight (water content varies). So that is $360/TDM \u2013 about $100/TDM more than wheat. Wastage at feed-out is researched as 20% at best when fed in the paddock. Wastage then costs $72/TDM, taking our bale to $162. Feed pads also have wastage in varying degrees. The best method to reduce wastage is palatability, and the best method to ensure palatability is a quality lactic acid bacterial silage inoculant. Shrinkage and/or wastage do not receive the attention they rightly deserve.", "\u00a0", "Silage has become a staple component of dairy cow diets virtually year round. Ensuring it is a cost effective feed source is critical. The efficiency of converting silage dollars to milk dollars is a significant contributor to farm profit. Today\u2019s inoculant market has many products on offer. Choosing a quality inoculant is essential to improve feed conversion efficiency.", "Multiple research projects in the USA have determined inoculants should supply 100,000 colony forming units (cfu) of initial fermentative bacteria per gram of silage. Research has also revealed cfu counts higher than this did not produce any improvement in fermentation quality. Pasture Gold guarantees a minimum of 100,000 cfu/gm of EU registered bacteria at ensiling. Further, Pasture Gold contains a third bacteria for preservation of silage when exposed to air at feed-out.", "The two upfront bacteria recommended from research are L. plantarum and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Pasture Gold contains both these of strains registered under stringent proof trials by EU agriculture regulators. Few inoculants in Australia contain bacteria with EU registration as proof of their effectiveness. The third bacteria is Propionibacterium freudenreichii for the purpose of producing preservative propionic acid in silage. The two upfront bacteria will lower silage pH very rapidly stabilising it and preventing further fermentation from damaging both quality and dry matter.", "Bacterial inoculants contain freeze dried bacteria which are activated when in contact with moisture. As live bacteria, stability and survival rates of bacteria are critical to the inoculant\u2019s effectiveness in silage. Again, EU registration requires evidence of product stability. Obviously silage inoculants that do not have EU registered bacteria can, and do, produce a variety of fermentation outcomes as differing bacterial species are common in an unregulated Australian market.", "Pasture Gold also contains an enzyme pack (fibre-technology) to increase silage digestibility. The science of enzymes in silage inoculant has now been reproduced in additives for mixer wagons that involve un-inoculated silage or hays and other forages or fibrous ingredients. Enzymes break down indigestible fibre (lignin), converting it to sugars that lactic acid bacteria then convert to lactic acid. Lactic acid is 10 times stronger than other fermentation acids and lowers pH rapidly to stability. This exposes increased digestible fibre to rumen bacteria for nutrient extraction and cow nutrition.", "Perhaps the greatest financial return from Pasture Gold is the abundance of lactic acid. Lactic acid is very palatable to cows. This ensures high intakes, but perhaps even more important, very little wastage. Silage wastage at feed-out is by far the greatest cost to silage as a feed in conversion to milk dollars. This wastage is the greater part of what is known as shrinkage. This term relates to tonnes of silage made less tonnes of silage consumed by cows. The difference is \u2018shrinkage\u2019 and has a very significant cost. Our October article explains this more fully.", "The physical shrinkage seen in bales or stacks is due to poor compaction, leaving air in the silage. Fermentation to stability is an anaerobic (no oxygen) process. The presence of oxygen will allow fermentation to continue unchecked and not achieve stability, consuming dry matter and nutrients.", "PASTURE GOLDTM", "Bacterial Silage Inoculant", "PASTURE GOLD silage inoculant is available in granular form for application via Gandy Granular Applicators, or water soluble form.", "PASTURE GOLD contains two EU registered LAB bacteria plus a preservative

Yet a study published in the Journal of Dairy Science, involving 24 dairies in the Rochester area of Victoria, and 200 colostrum samples, revealed only 23% were found to be satisfactory. A majority of calves were receiving colostrum with high bacteria levels. This reduces the transfer of passive immunity. Although there was no mention of actual immunoglobulin content, based on similar US studies, only 33% of colostrum contained adequate immunoglobulin. Our own work in this area has proven conclusively, low protein in transition diets is a determining factor in adequate passive transfer of immunity (quality colostrum).", "There is a lesser known fact regarding colostrum quality and quantity, and that is the 180 identified other substances in colostrum are responsible for \u2018switching-on\u2019 genes.

Potential pathogen load in milk is also a threat. There is a growing trend to pasteurisation on-farm of calf milk overseas. The few farms I\u2019ve heard of in Australia doing this have experienced major gains in calf health which translates directly to growth rates and minimal health related costs in both drugs and especially, labour.", "A clean comfortable environment for developing calves would seem obvious. Yet failure in this area is widespread. In recent years I have seen purpose built calf facilities that are producing excellent results. Airflow in summer, warmth in winter and ventilation to remove ammonia, a major cause of respiratory disease, are essential. Immune function is an energy-hungry system.

A very high number of cows do have some degree of ketosis from body fat mobilisation, especially when suppressed feed intake induces negative energy balance. Additional body fat is mobilised attempting to meet this energy deficiency resulting in fatty liver syndrome, the precursor of ketosis.

The consequences of sub-clinical hypocalcaemia have far more serious effects than we realise, and far more reaching into lactation production, health and fertility.

Initially, at calving, there are big benefits in oral calcium supplements (drenches or boluses) to help cows cope with \u201clactational osteoporosis\u201d. This is virtually unavoidable to meet the 300% increase in calcium that fresh cows require. Oetzel estimates sub-clinical hypocalcaemia at four times the cost of clinical milk fever. When research has identified up to 60% of mature cows suffer sub-clinical hypocalcaemia, at four times the cost of clinical milk fever, then this is a very significant cost to farm profit.", "Sub-clinical hypocalcaemia is well documented as the prerequisite to a numerous diseases common around calving: obviously clinical milk fever, but add to that, retained membrane, metritis, mastitis, ketosis, and a major industry problem, fertility. Productive life as milking cows can be unnecessarily cut short as a result of sub-optimal calcium nutrition. Our clients that have been proactive in calcium nutrition have seen major decreases in fresh cow mastitis, metritis, and very significant improvements in fertility.", "My concern is, in our low calcium ryegrass pastures, this hypocalcemic disorder goes on well past early lactation. A cow producing 30 litres of milk is exporting 36 gm of calcium daily in milk. That\u2019s the calcium content of 100+ gms of limestone.

Where I live in SW Victoria we sit on top of a limestone mountain, yet I see very little spreading of lime on pastures. Certainly SW Vic would benefit immensely from gypsum applications.

For many years researchers believed reduced intake lowered milk production, however, it is now known changes in the cow\u2019s metabolism also contribute to reduced milk production. Most recent research has highlighted changes in the rumen wall making it more porous and enabling bacteria to be absorbed into the blood stream. This then causes a systemic inflammation due to immune response. Immune response draws on glucose reducing its availability for milk production.", "An unfortunate situation for our cows is usually, the highest risk of heat stress also coincides with the highest fibre diet. Fermentation of fibre in the rumen produces extensive heat. Increasing grain feeding during risk periods will reduce dependence on high fibre diets yet sustain, or better, increase energy intake.

Before we go down the path of water quality, my experience on farm is supply rate is a major issue. Frequently I see a large number of cows standing around an empty water trough with just a trickle of water flowing into the trough. The cost to milk production, let alone the above impacts on cows\u2019 health, would be staggering. As herds have increased in size, yet the existing water system has not, creates a major bottleneck. Most of the farms I work with have well supplied water troughs immediately after the dairy exit.

Regular cleaning of troughs is likely the better way, and very necessary as bacteria and a multitude of other organisms and plant-life grow wonderfully in warm water under a summer sun. Chlorination via an injection system will also clean water, however, a reaction/settling tank is necessary for dissipation of residual compounds.", "Sulphates in high concentration will reduce water intake.

If you are feeding electrolytes to scouring calves it is necessary they either drink milk also, or calf starter grain to maintain energy intake or starvation will finish them. Initially, until the calf is drinking from a separate water source, filling the milk feeder with warm water within 10 to 30 minutes of feeding milk will drive water intake. Water temperature does affect intake.

Research has suggested between 4:1 & 6:1 ratio of water to grain intake. Taking an average of 5:1, our calf must drink 5 litres of water to consume 1 kg of calf grain. A good calf grain mix should supply more energy and protein than milk. Obviously, the faster we have calves increasing water intake, the more grain they will eat and their plain of nutrition (energy & protein) will rise rapidly. Accordingly, growth rate will also accelerate rapidly. By day 56 this ratio is closer to 2:1 through rumen development.", "\nCalf grain intake plays another major role apart from simply increasing energy and protein intake. A course grain mix (as opposed to pelleted) will help increase water intake, but apart from that, starch from grain will produce Volatile Fatty Acids from grain digestion which drives the growth of rumen papillae, the absorption site of nutrient to the blood stream. The faster we develop rumen papillae the sooner the calf can be weaned as it will be capable of digestion solid foods then. We use calf grain intake as the indicator for weaning. A calf consuming 2 kgs of calf grain daily has developed the rumen sufficiently to digest solid feeds and can be weaned. There is a significant cost saving in both feed cost and labour to benefit from by early weaning.", "\nGrain intake must continue to rise post-weaning as the rumen, although developed sufficiently to extract nutrient from grain mixes, it still cannot digest forage adequately to supply the necessary energy and protein for both maintenance and growth.

Water intake remains the driver of post-weaning growth by its ratio of 2:1, water to grain, increasing the calf\u2019s rising plane of nutrition correlating growth and development.
