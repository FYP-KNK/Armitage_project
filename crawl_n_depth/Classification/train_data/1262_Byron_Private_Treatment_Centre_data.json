Without taming the mind and thoughts, it can spiral out of control creating a domino affect on the body, breath, emotions, and reflexes and can result in cravings and addictions.

When practiced regularly over time, yoga for depression therapy induces a profound sense of relaxation with endless restorative effects and a heightened sense of self, leading to inner peace, bliss, and eventually self-realisation.", "Recognised as a powerful adjunct to recovery treatment, daily yoga therapy\u00a0sessions will introduce you to a daily ritual to practice through recovery and into the future.
