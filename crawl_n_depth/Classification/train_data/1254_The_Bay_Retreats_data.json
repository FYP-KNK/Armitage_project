This article reviews the literature regarding the experience of chronic illness, theories about meditation, and clinical effects of this self-care practice. Eastern theories of meditation include Buddhist psychology. The word Buddha means the awakened one, and Buddhist meditators have been called the first scientists, alluding to more than 2500 years of precise, detailed observation of inner experience. The knowledge that comprises Buddhist psychology was derived inductively from the historical figure's (Prince Siddhartha Gautama) diligent self-inquiry. Western theories of meditation include Jungian, Benson's relaxation response, and transpersonal psychology. Clinical effects of meditation impact a broad spectrum of physical and psychological symptoms and syndromes, including reduced anxiety, pain, and depression, enhanced mood and self-esteem, and decreased stress. Meditation has been studied in populations with fibromyalgia, cancer, hypertension, and psoriasis. While earlier studies were small and lacked experimental controls, the quality and quantity of valid research is growing. Meditation practice can positively influence the experience of chronic illness and can serve as a primary, secondary, and/or tertiary prevention strategy. Health professionals demonstrate commitment to holistic practice by asking patients about use of meditation, and can encourage this self-care activity. Simple techniques for mindfulness can be taught in the clinical setting. Living mindfully with chronic illness is a fruitful area for research, and it can be predicted that evidence will grow to support the role of consciousness in the human experience of disease.", "\u00a0", "4.

While several studies of college student populations have evinced positive correlations between levels of trait mindfulness and substance use, the opposite seems to be true in clinical samples, with multiple studies showing a negative association. The current study reviews research in both non-treatment seeking college students and in clinical samples, and examines the relationship between trait mindfulness and substance dependence in a clinical sample (N = 281).

Participants medically cleared for continuing care were aged 18 to 70 years; 71.5% were male and 42.1% were of ethnic/racial minority.", "Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to 8 weekly group sessions of MBRP, cognitive-behavioral RP, or TAU.", "Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes included relapse to drug use and heavy drinking as well as frequency of substance use in the past 90 days. Variables were assessed at baseline and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up points. Measures used included self-report of relapse and urinalysis drug and alcohol screenings.", "Results: Compared with TAU, participants assigned to MBRP and RP reported significantly lower risk of relapse to substance use and heavy drinking and, among those who used substances, significantly fewer days of substance use and heavy drinking at the 6-month follow-up. Cognitive-behavioral RP showed an advantage over MBRP in time to first drug use. At the 12-month follow-up, MBRP participants reported significantly fewer days of substance use and significantly decreased heavy drinking compared with RP and TAU.", "Conclusions and Relevance: For individuals in aftercare following initial treatment for substance use disorders, RP and MBRP, compared with TAU, produced significantly reduced relapse risk to drug use and heavy drinking. Relapse prevention delayed time to first drug use at 6-month follow-up, with MBRP and RP participants who used alcohol also reporting significantly fewer heavy drinking days compared with TAU participants. At 12-month follow-up, MBRP offered added benefit over RP and TAU in reducing drug use and heavy drinking.

However, it remains unclear whether these pathways constitute specific shared neurobiological mechanisms or more extensive components universal to the broader human experience of psychological distress or suffering. We offer a theoretical, clinical and neurobiological perspective of the overlaps between these disorders, highlight common neural pathways that play a role in depression and substance use disorders and discuss how these commonalities may frame our conceptualization and treatment of co-occurring disorders.

Although clinical interest has predominantly focused on mindfulness meditation, there also has been an increase in the scientific investigation of interventions that integrate other Buddhist principles such as compassion, loving kindness, and \u201cnon-self.\u201d However, due to the rapidity at which Buddhism has been assimilated into the mental health setting, issues relating to the misapplication of Buddhist terms and practices have sometimes arisen. Indeed, hitherto, there has been no unified system for the effective clinical operationalization of Buddhist principles. Therefore, this paper aims to establish robust foundations for the ongoing clinical implementation of Buddhist principles by providing: (i) succinct and accurate interpretations of Buddhist terms and principles that have become embedded into the clinical practice literature, (ii) an overview of current directions in the clinical operationalization of BDIs, and (iii) an assessment of BDI clinical integration issues. It is concluded that BDIs may be effective treatments for a variety of psychopathologies including mood-spectrum disorders, substance-use disorders, and schizophrenia. However, further research and clinical evaluation is required to strengthen the evidence-base for existent interventions and for establishing new treatment applications. More important, there is a need for greater dialogue between Buddhist teachers and mental health clinicians and researchers to safeguard the ethical values, efficacy, and credibility of BDIs.", "\u00a0", "36.

The potential debate in the rank ordering and classification of drugs by their harmful effect or legality suggests that all classifications and rank ordering are open to criticism and are dependent upon varied opinions, values, and ways of looking at drugs and their use in a society.

Practicing these three elements, each person is gently guided toward wholeness.", "Our Approach sees destructive patterns of thought and behaviour, including chemical dependencies, as an individual's unhealthy yet creative adaptation for survival in the face of life\u2019s experiences. Rather than seeing them as stuck or embedded for life, we believe that these adaptations can change and that the individual can therefore also change.", "At The Bay, a personalised treatment program will be tailored for your particular needs and situation. We are a single client, one-to-one facility; your retreat is completely individual to your needs with our team of experts entirely focused on your care. Our approach utilises trauma-informed care, evidence-based therapeutic methods as well as an empathetic understanding and compassion for your life history and personal rehabilitation goals.", "Trauma-informed care is essentially the backbone of our program because trauma and drug addiction are so often intimately connected. If the emotions caused by painful events in your life are not uncovered and given their own proper treatment, you will be more likely to return to substance abuse as a coping mechanism after you leave a program.", "Trauma occurs in the lives of many people. It can sometimes take months or years for the full impact of trauma to come to light. Trauma can be experienced via a single event, a series of events, or sometimes even quite subtle experiences that build up over time. The effects or memories of distressing events such as childhood abuse, natural disasters, accidents, war, emotional betrayal, can all cause a person to suffer from emotional shock and resulting trauma.", "It is quite common in our culture for people to use substances to regulate unmanageable feelings and in the absence of suitable alternatives, this is perhaps a sensible approach. However once that substance is removed, those difficult feelings or traumas can rise to the surface.", "As a result, simply detoxing from a substance such as alcohol or opiates is rarely effective, as the underlying issues have not yet been addressed. This is why a trauma-informed approach to addiction rehabilitation and care is critical for successful ongoing recovery.", "Through this approach, you can better understand the actual underlying reasons for your addiction or unconscious behaviour. Once you come to a clearer awareness and understanding of why you may be behaving in a self-destructive manner, you can begin to heal the layers with an integrated approach; you may also arrive at self-compassion \u2013 that moment when guilt falls away to be replaced with understanding and self-awareness.", "Trauma-informed care is an evidence-based approach that works to:", "Our evidence-based approach to addiction treatment has shown us time and again, that an addiction is actually a response, or a symptom of something else, usually a trauma of some kind in the past.", "Some people talk about having an \u201caddictive personality\u201d which carries with it a sense of finality. However, our evidence-based approach to addiction treatment has shown us time and again, that an addiction is actually a response, or a symptom of something else, usually a trauma of some kind in the past. So instead of focusing solely on the addiction itself, we believe it is important to delve deeper and consider the underlying reasons; to understand why you began abusing drugs or alcohol in the first place.", "Even though evidence-based treatment differs from recovery programs such as the 12 Steps popularised by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), our approach in no way negates, nor dismisses the 12 Steps, or your own belief systems.", "At The Bay we can, and often do, work with individuals who are working with the 12 Steps, and find that evidence-based treatment can work well alongside the more traditional approach of AA.", "The Bay Approach\u2122 utilises evidence-based psychological practice to address the root causes of pain and dysfunction. This practice is teamed with mindfulness meditation techniques that can help to develop presence or the ability to \u201cbe present\u201d in the moment regardless of what is happening. Mindfulness and attentiveness to one\u2019s inner life can cultivate inner connection and lead to meaningful relationships and positive change.

Self-induced and self-practiced, yoga brings balance, greater awareness, acceptance of self, personal growth, and calm; lessens anxiety and depression and heightens self-esteem; and creates a positive social activity in an insightful context. Studies over 30 years have consistently concluded that meditation enhances recovery therapies and dramatically reduces relapse, as well as diminishing anxiety, stress, and depression. Furthermore, if we assume Abraham Maslow, creator of the \"Hierarchy of Needs\", was right, and happiness lies in self-actualization, it is interesting to note that in a recent study on therapies that lead to self-actualization, meditation techniques yielded extreme effectiveness, showing substantial positive gains in virtually every category of self-actualization, and in just two months (Williams, P., 2002).", "The Taoists say, \"the wrong path is by its nature self-punishing.\" Though pain is often necessary to gaining a clearer path in life, and recovery is certainly no exception, yoga gently cushions the struggle toward self-awareness by providing a context of compassion, and a set of directions for inward exploration without judgment, regret, or anxiety. It teaches people to honour their bodies as the outward reflection of mind and spirit, and of their enormous potential. Instead of feeling powerless to overcome a substance or a compulsion, yoga highlights a person's innate ability to manage his or her thoughts, emotions, and behaviours. By looking inward in meditation, yoga practitioners gather awareness of the workings of mind and personality, and knowledge is power. Many are the yoga treatises that speak to a person's responsibility for his or her own happiness, and the ways of learning to direct thoughts and emotions - using natural abilities to proactively seek calm, tolerance, detachment, and compassion. From physical, to mental, to spiritual empowerment, studies consistently demonstrate that the practice of yoga and yogic meditation create an outstanding support to sobriety, and therefore, should become a usual referral source for counsellors who are looking to proactively support those clients who are struggling to remain abstinent in general, and especially those in need of an effective adjunct to post-inpatient treatment.", "Katie Tandon, Wednesday, 02 January 2008.\u00a0", "Retrieved 06 August 2008 from\u00a0", "http://www.counselormagazine.com/content/view/631/63/", "\u00a9 Copyright 2020 The Bay Retreats", "Digital Marketing by Fat Cake", ".

In that letter, he recounted a story of a former patient of Jung's named Roland, who had been through all kinds of institutions to cure him of his alcoholism. When Roland found his way to Jung in the early 1930s, the doctor told him that he was a \"hopeless case\" and that his only chance for a cure was to \"become the subject of a spiritual or religious experience--in short, a genuine conversion.\" (Wilson/Jung, Letters, 1987). When back in the United States, Roland discovered The Oxford Group, an evangelical movement dedicated to the principles of self-survey, confession, restitution, and service to others. He found sobriety there and through another member of the group helped Bill Wilson get sober.", "In Jung's reply, he told Bill W. that he had always wondered what had happened to Roland and was glad to hear that he had experienced his religious conversion. He also told Bill W. a few things that he had not told Roland due to the fact that, at that time, he felt his notions about spirituality were not well received by the traditional medical and psychoanalytic community. He told Bill Wilson that he believed that Roland's \"craving for alcohol was the equivalent, on a low level, of the spiritual thirst of our being for wholeness; expressed in the medieval language: the union with God.\" (Wilson/Jung, Letters, 1987). He then went on to say, \"You see, \"alcohol\" in Latin is spiritus, and you use the same word for the highest religious experience as well as for the most depraving poison. The helpful formula therefore is: spiritus contra spiritum.\" (Wilson/Jung Letters, 1987). Carl Jung's message, delivered through Roland to Bill Wilson, eventually became the basis of the principles of Alcoholics Anonymous.", "So for years, the spiritual component of the recovery process has largely fallen under the auspices of Alcoholics Anonymous. When alcoholism become recognized as a medical disorder, treatable in the traditional Western medical model of intervention, the medical establishment focused heavily on the physical aspects of the disorder and less on the emotional and psychological aspects, leaving the spiritual component entirely out of the loop. In fact, historically, the therapeutic value of spirituality and religion have largely been neglected in the teaching and practice of medicine in general (Office of Alternative Medicine Report to NIH, 1992). So it comes as no surprise that this bias would infiltrate the medicalization of the\u00a0treatment of addictions. In recent years, however, there has been an increased awareness and interest in spiritual practices and processes, not only as an integral part of the Twelve Steps, but as adjuncts to more traditional medical and psychotherapeutic interventions in the addictive process. And as the\u00a0addictions treatment\u00a0field has grown from infancy into a legitimate field of study and taken on its own identity, we find a renewed effort to re-integrate the spiritual component of recovery into our treatment efforts.", "We have also seen an increased interest in spirituality in our society at large. I believe we are seeing, at the very roots of our culture, a longing for a spiritual remedy for the rampant societal addiction to all things material. In an article in the Christian Science Monitor (12/16/98) George H. Gallup, Jr., Chairman of the George H. Gallup International Institute, responded to questions about his recent survey of spirituality in the United States. He stated, \"There's a remarkable surge in spirituality in this country today. We've documented it in surveys. The proportion of people who believe that it's very important for them to examine the meaning of life has soared in the last 13 years. The proportion of people eager to search for the sacred in their lives has soared in the last four years. So, we're at a moment of great discovery and a retreat from materialism. The disappointments of this century, the failure when we don't let God into our lives, when we try to run things ourselves, is dramatically apparent in the events of this century. There's a great interest in spiritual life, and people are removing themselves from bondages of various sorts. Whether it's chemical or otherwise, the root to recovery is 'letting go, letting God.'\" (Gallup, 1998).", "So it seems that our culture is now just discovering what Carl Jung, Bill Wilson, and millions of recovering alcoholics, addicts, and their families have known for years, that the prescription for alcoholism (and all\u00a0addictions) truly is \"spiritus contra spiritum.\" (Jung/Wilson Letters, 1987). Spirit against the ravages of spirits.", "Let's use this formula to investigate for ourselves where our search for God is displaced onto a \"false god.\" Get comfortable in your chair. Relax your muscles. Take a few deep breaths, close your eyes, or soften your gaze and find a point of concentration on the floor or across the room. Allow your attention to drop inside to a place of stillness. When you come to a place of stillness, as if you are sitting by a deep pool, drop in this question, like a small pebble, and simply notice what arises, like the rippling effect on the water. What is my intoxicant? Don't look for an answer, simply notice what arises in your awareness; an image, words, thoughts, feelings, sensations in the body, whatever arises as an effect of asking this question. Trust what arises.", "Your intoxicant may or may not be a chemical or substance. It may be a process, an activity, an emotion, a state of mind, etc. Now spend a few moments noticing whatever beliefs arise in relation to this question. Now take another deep breath, come back to a place of stillness and drop in another question. What is my story of intoxication? Let this question float in your awareness, let it ripple through your still pool. Take a few minutes to notice what arises. Now take another deep breath, come back to stillness and drop in the question: What is my true experience of God? When you are ready, open your eyes and write down whatever you noticed during this exercise.", "You can integrate this practice of investigation into your daily life as a kind of\u00a0mindfulness\u00a0meditation, allowing yourself to notice what kinds of intoxicants you \"imbibe.\" Remember, your intoxicants may not be chemicals at all, but certain beliefs, thoughts, desires, emotions, or states of mind. Also, as you investigate the story of your intoxicant and the effect of your attachment to that story, notice what happens when you put the story aside for a moment-- as if you were putting down a drink. Think of it as an experiment in awareness. You may discover that your real experience of yourself and God is a kind of \"sobriety\" that opens you to truth and real joy.", "Remember, you are simply noticing. There is no requirement to give up your intoxicant, just a simple willingness to notice the effect of \"picking it up\" and letting it take over your life. When we see how \"picking up\" these \"false gods\" leads us to greater suffering, we simply lose the desire to chase them. They let go of us.", "Patricia A.

That's far more important than techniques or strategies for change. In short, the fundamental insights of twentieth-century physics have yet to penetrate the world of medicine and therapy: relationships are more fundamental than things. To paraphrase physicist Bohm again, the imperative of therapy is to evolve our awareness, so that it might naturally become more whole, more in line with our connectedness to others. Einstein summarized this when he said: \"Our task must be to widen our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.\" In this way, we will not just see the world as it is but as we are, for no human being, including psychotherapists, have a privileged view of reality.", "Martin Buber said: \"Freedom and destiny are solemnly promised to one another and linked together in meaning.\" But, as Native American teachers have said, often the longest road we will ever walk is the sacred journey from our head to our heart.", "Written by David J.

", "Web Design and Development by Mity Digital", "+61266844240", "The modern day perspective asserts that addiction is primarily a psychological and physiological disorder. There are psychological triggers, circumstances, and patterns of behavior that initiate and re-enforce addictive behavior as well as physiological correlates of\u00a0addiction\u00a0that further compel it. For example, alcoholism is seen as triggered by a variety of identifiable psychological circumstances sustained by physiological dependence.", "The approach to treatment is multi-modal addressing both its psychological and biological aspects. Twelve Steps programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous, currently the mainstay of treatment for addictive disorders, have expanded this perspective by emphasizing the role of\u00a0spirituality. Because of its success in assisting with addiction, it is important to carefully examine the original spiritual vision and intent of AA. This undertaking will point us in the direction of a very different understanding of this disorder.", "In early 1961 there was an important exchange of letters between Bill Wilson, the founder of AA, and the famed Swiss psychologist Carl Jung. Bill Wilson wrote to Jung his desire to relate the fate of one of Jung's patients, Roland H., who Jung had treated for alcoholism. He reminded Jung about his advice to his patient and related how this counsel ultimately led to the founding of AA. Bill Wilson writes in his note that during Roland's last visit to Jung he was advised that neither medicine nor psychiatry had a cure for alcoholism and that his case was therefore \"hopeless.\" When Roland further inquired of Jung whether there was any hope to be found Jung answered yes, \"... if he could become the subject of a spiritual or religious experience.\"", "Unknown to Jung, who never again saw Roland H, he left Jung's office and subsequently joined the Oxford Group, an evangelical movement in Europe that emphasized\u00a0meditation\u00a0and prayer. Through his spiritual efforts, he overcame his\u00a0addiction. He returned to New York and through series of inter-connections, Bill Wilson became aware of the experience of Roland H. with the Oxford Group and following his example similarly achieved a remission from alcoholism. Wilson then went on to start what we now know as AA.", "What were Jung's recollections about his final meeting with Roland H.? What did he write in response to Bill Wilson's thank-you note to him? Here are Jung's words:", "His craving for alcohol was the equivalent, at a low level, of the spiritual thirst of our being for wholeness;", "You see, \"alcohol\" in Latin is spiritus, and you use the same word for the highest religious experience as well as for the most depraving poison.", "Jung understood that the driving force and root cause of addictive behavior was the addicts unrecognized and unmet spiritual need. In order to heal addiction at its source this natural and unmet spiritual need must be responded to and satisfied in an appropriate and authentic manner.", "Jung was correct, very correct. He knew and could articulate what we all know and feel - that we are in exile from our true home, our spiritual home. We know this place of exile. We know it through a persistent and vague discontent, dissatisfaction, meaninglessness, and longing that move through our sadness and pleasure. We know it from a ceaseless sense that there is more to life than what we live each day. We know it from our search for meaning and purpose, and from our endless striving and ambition. We know it from those rare glimpses when we touch a deeper presence that removes us from our day-to-day world and briefly opens a doorway to the transcendent and divine. But we can neither hold nor abide in this essence for more than a few moments. Yet neither can we let it go.", "Each of us carries within our self this inner presence, this timeless peace, wholeness, and well-being long after we have wandered from our natural home early in life. It is this vague but extraordinary recollection of our true nature that drives us to reunite with it once again. The authentic search and reunion with our inner home is a genuine spiritual path. The false search is called addiction.\u00a0Addiction\u00a0is a mistaken path to the genuine impulse for a spiritual reawakening.", "It can be said that all addictions - emotional and physical, positive and negative - arise from the natural impulse for the spiritual existence. They arise in response to the human possibility of transcendence - the possibility of a higher life. But addictions are mistaken perversions of this natural impulse to return to our deeper home. They obscure the true path while intoxicating us with temporary pleasures that are inadvertently substituted for the enduring peace,\u00a0happiness, and wholeness that patiently waits within.", "Unless we can diagnose the problem correctly we cannot apply the correct therapy. It is easy and customary to respond to addiction with pharmacological and psychological measures. And they are of value in managing addictions. But they work on the surface rather than at the source. They pull out weeds rather than destroy the root system. That is why in modern times we consider addictions \"life long\" problems. They return like weeds in the spring when their underground roots have been left intact by partial and limited understandings and treatments.", "But what if we could understand addictions correctly - not so much as physical, emotional, and psychological disorders - but recognize them at their source as spiritual problems? Then we could apply the correct antidote, the only authentic and enduring healing elixir. To do so we must approach what is essentially a problem of the mind through the mind - through an expansion of consciousness.", "The problem of addiction is really quite simple to understand when approached from the direction of consciousness studies in distinction to psychology. Here is how it goes. Our natural state is one of simple unadorned awareness. It is the gap between two thoughts - two mental movements. As our mind is usually filled with ceaseless chatter what remains of this natural condition are only these small gaps of stillness and naked open awareness. However, there are other moments in life when we can also experience this place of stillness, timelessness, peace, and wholeness. We can experience this in communion with nature, at the peak of athletic performance, through the arts, in the first blush of romance, at the peak of sexuality, at times of awe and wonder, and in\u00a0meditation.", "For a moment, we are lifted out of our usual experience, lifted out of our busy minds into a world that is both familiar and unfamiliar. In these moments all mental - that is cognitive activity - ceases and experience flows freely. We are awake, aware, alive, and one with experience. Here there is neither suffering nor addiction, and not even the usual sense of \"I.\" For a moment, we are in the center of our being. All is complete in this moment. There is no further longing and certainly no addictions. We all know this place. It is the authentic and healing object of our longing and of life itself. But we are unable to sustain this experience because our mind has been trained to default back to thought and cognition -- from who we are to what we've become.", "But we continue to long for this heaven on earth. We are tired of being refugees in the inhospitable land of ceaseless mental chatter. We long for home. We long for our self. We seek it everywhere, except where it is - within. Therein lies the entire problem and solution of modern addictions. In our mistaken search for our native home, in our effort to re-experience the peace, happiness, and wholeness of the spiritual life we reach out to counterfeit experiences and turn them into counterfeit gods believing all the time we have found our lost world.\u00a0Addiction\u00a0results from this grand and convincing delusion.", "Pleasure is the name we give to these counterfeit experiences. Seen superficially they are just that - pleasurable. Seen more deeply they are distractions and diversions that assure suffering by taking us further and further from our authentic self. How could this be? How could we be so mistaken? How could a temporary pleasure that is really nothing more that an experience that relieves a previous moment of suffering be mistaken for the real thing? The answer is through habit, cultural conditioning, false role models, the hypnosis of temporary sensual pleasures, imagined material security, and the ephemeral allure of fame, name, and worldly success. We are taught to seek these pleasures as if they were the real thing. In fact, our entire economy is dependent on sustaining these false gods. And the advertising industry works as hard as possible to support and market this delusion.", "What must be apparent by now is that we are all, to one degree or another, addicts. Some of our addictions are socially unacceptable and overtly destructive while others are socially encouraged although they insidiously rob us of life and health. From a conventional mundane perspective, the first is termed addiction and the second normal.", "By adding contemplative practice to the multimodal approach now used to control the symptoms of addictive disorders we can bring to bear a powerful set of methodologies specifically directed at reversing the sequence of events that leads to\u00a0addiction. These methodologies, whose theoretical base and practical application have been developed and time-tested, are diverse and highly nuanced. They are grounded in the practitioner/client relationship and a human community of like-minded individuals. Contemplative approaches can be tailored to a wide range of individual capacities, temperaments, and dispositions.", "Beyond their capacity to overcome addictive disorders these very same techniques can assist the individual in moving toward greater wellbeing. Although our initial effort is to ameliorate addictive behavior our larger goal should be to assist the individual in \"using\" the gift of this disorder as a step to a higher level of living.", "Elliott S.

This article reviews the literature regarding the experience of chronic illness, theories about meditation, and clinical effects of this self-care practice. Eastern theories of meditation include Buddhist psychology. The word Buddha means the awakened one, and Buddhist meditators have been called the first scientists, alluding to more than 2500 years of precise, detailed observation of inner experience. The knowledge that comprises Buddhist psychology was derived inductively from the historical figure's (Prince Siddhartha Gautama) diligent self-inquiry. Western theories of meditation include Jungian, Benson's relaxation response, and transpersonal psychology. Clinical effects of meditation impact a broad spectrum of physical and psychological symptoms and syndromes, including reduced anxiety, pain, and depression, enhanced mood and self-esteem, and decreased stress. Meditation has been studied in populations with fibromyalgia, cancer, hypertension, and psoriasis. While earlier studies were small and lacked experimental controls, the quality and quantity of valid research is growing. Meditation practice can positively influence the experience of chronic illness and can serve as a primary, secondary, and/or tertiary prevention strategy. Health professionals demonstrate commitment to holistic practice by asking patients about use of meditation, and can encourage this self-care activity. Simple techniques for mindfulness can be taught in the clinical setting. Living mindfully with chronic illness is a fruitful area for research, and it can be predicted that evidence will grow to support the role of consciousness in the human experience of disease.", "\u00a0", "4.

While several studies of college student populations have evinced positive correlations between levels of trait mindfulness and substance use, the opposite seems to be true in clinical samples, with multiple studies showing a negative association. The current study reviews research in both non-treatment seeking college students and in clinical samples, and examines the relationship between trait mindfulness and substance dependence in a clinical sample (N = 281).

Mindfulness practices have become increasingly popular as complementary therapeutic strategies for a variety of medical and psychiatric conditions. This paper provides an overview of three mindfulness interventions that have demonstrated effectiveness for psychiatric symptoms and/or pain. The goal of this review is to provide a synopsis that practicing clinicians can use as a clinical reference concerning Zen meditation, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). All three approaches originated from Buddhist spiritual practices, but only Zen is an actual Buddhist tradition. MBSR and MBCT are secular, clinically based methods that employ manuals and standardized techniques. Studies indicate that MBSR and MBCT have broad-spectrum antidepressant and antianxiety effects and decrease general psychological distress. MBCT is strongly recommended as an adjunctive treatment for unipolar depression. The evidence suggests that both MBSR and MBCT have efficacy as adjunctive interventions for anxiety symptoms. MBSR is beneficial for general psychological health and stress management in those with medical and psychiatric illness as well as in healthy individuals.

BzRAs are readily available and effective in the short-term management of insomnia, but evidence of long-term efficacy is scarce and most hypnotic drugs are associated with potential adverse effects. CBT is an effective alternative for chronic insomnia. Although more time consuming than drug management, CBT produces sleep improvements that are sustained over time, and this therapy is accepted by patients. Although CBT is not readily available in most clinical settings, access and delivery can be made easier through use of innovative methods such as telephone consultations, group therapy, and self-help approaches.

Accordingly, the current study examined the effect of compassion meditation on innate immune, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress and evaluated the degree to which engagement in meditation practice influenced stress reactivity. Sixty-one healthy adults were randomized to 6 weeks of training in compassion meditation (n=33) or participation in a health discussion control group (n=28) followed by exposure to a standardized laboratory stressor (Trier social stress test [TSST]). Physiologic and behavioral responses to the TSST were determined by repeated assessments of plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 and cortisol as well as total distress scores on the Profile of Mood States (POMS). No main effect of group assignment on TSST responses was found for IL-6, cortisol or POMS scores. However, within the meditation group, increased meditation practice was correlated with decreased TSST-induced IL-6 (r(p)=-0.46, p=0.008) and POMS distress scores (r(p)=-0.43, p=0.014). Moreover, individuals with meditation practice times above the median exhibited lower TSST-induced IL-6 and POMS distress scores compared to individuals below the median, who did not differ from controls.
