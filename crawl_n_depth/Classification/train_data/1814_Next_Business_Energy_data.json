Solar panels absorb direct sunlight which is then converted into a power source that is used to flow through an electrical panel. \u201cBut how does the process even begin?\u201d, I hear you ask\u2026. Well, in addition to other elements, solar panels are generally made out of a layer of silicon cells and a wiring system that allows direct currents to pass through the silicon cells. As the sun releases tiny bursts of energy known as photons, and they travel down and hit the silicon cells found in a solar panel, it releases electrons from the photons and initiates an electrical direct current. A solar inverter then converts the direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC) electricity. This act is known as the\u00a0\u201cphotovoltaic effect\u201d and it is only after this step has occurred can you utilise solar energy as solar power for a commercial customer.", "So, far so good, right? But what happens if you generate power at times when it\u2019s not needed? Let me introduce you to solar batteries! With a solar battery, you have the ability to store the solar power you generate and use it at times you need it most. When your battery is full, the excess energy generated is sent to back to the grid and you are paid a feed-in tariff. \u201cHow do solar batteries work?\u201d. Well, solar batteries store the DC energy contained by your solar panels (as explained above) and, with the assistance of an integrated inverter, can convert ", "and store", " that DC energy into AC energy.

This usually depends on the size classification of your business. Because Next Business Energy are SME energy specialists, we will focus on small to medium businesses. Each business structure requires the recipient to have a smart meter installed on their property.

This process is then reset either each month or year depending on your agreement, therefore it is possible for your demand charge to change.", "A small business would typically use less than 60 MWh per annum. The smart meter determines the peak 30 minute period and then converts that into a demand charge for that billing period. The energy distributor then communicates this charge to the energy retailer. The charge then appears on the invoice via the energy retailer. For example, if your distributor charges $15 per kilowatt (kW) a month, and your peak-demand smart meter usage is determined at 80kW, your monthly demand charge will be $1,200 for that month.", "Medium businesses would typically use more than 60 MWh per annum and have a maximum demand of less than 120kW. This pricing structure includes a peak and off-peak charge in addition to a demand charge element. Referred to as cost reflective or demand-based pricing, the aim of this pricing structure is to create more ownership over businesses electricity use and to encourage greater off-peak usage. Peak times are usually measured between 7am \u2013 10pm. Off peak is outside those hours.", "Demand is not measured on weekends and public holidays, however, the charge still applies equally on these days.", "In order to lower your demand charge, the user must learn to use appliances separately or invest in appliances with a higher energy rating. If we use the small business example above, in the case that the user lowers their daily peak-demand usage to 70kW, the monthly demand charge is then reduced to $1,050.", "The basic concept of demand charges is to encourage stagnation of appliance use throughout the day.

Residential and small business customers in New South Wales, South East Queensland and South Australia who are on flat pricing will take advantage of the reference price.", "Q. Is the reference price the same in each state?", "A. No, each state has a different reference price for small business customers on flat rates.", "State Small Business Flat Rate", "New South Wales                $6783 \u2013 8754", "South East Queensland \u00a0    $6481", "South Australia \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  $10016", "Source: AER Determination pages 61-62", "Q. Why isn\u2019t my state covered by the reference price?", "A. If you do not live in New South Wales, South East Queensland or South Australia you may already have regulated energy prices in your state. Alternatively, the Victorian Government is implementing the Victorian Default Offer.", "Q. How does the reference price affect my current standing offer?", "A. Your current standing offer rates will automatically set to or under the reference price. You should have already received an email or letter from Next Business Energy, or your current energy retailer, if this affects your account.", "Q. How do I know if I am on a standing offer?", "A. If you haven\u2019t contacted your energy retailer in years, or if you entered into an energy contract for a certain duration and it has expired, it is likely you are on a standing offer. If you are a Next Business Energy customer and would like to check if you are on a standing offer, please call us on 1300 466 398 between 9am \u2013 5pm Monday to Friday.", "Q. What is the purpose of the reference price?", "A. The purpose of a reference price is to make it easier for residential and small business consumers on flat pricing to compare energy deals.", "Q. What is the difference between the reference price and the cap on standing offers?", "A. The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) has determined a single price which will be used in two different ways. Primarily, the reference price will be used as a baseline to compare energy deals. Secondly, but just as importantly, it acts as a cap on the rates a retailer, including Next Business Energy, can charge on a standing offer.", "Q. Can I be worse off changing from a standing offer to a market offer?", "A. Market offers usually offer a plan with lower rates than standing offers. They also may contain discounts such as a pay on time discount. It is important to note that if you choose a plan with a pay on time discount, the benefit will only apply if the customer pays their invoice on or before the due date. If the customer fails to do this, they will not benefit from the discount. ", "Q. Does the reference price affect solar, demand or time-of-use customers?", "A. The reference price, or price cap, only applies to residential or small business customers on flat rate tariffs. Saying this, retailers including Next Business Energy, will be required to compare both flat rates and time of use offers to the reference price.
