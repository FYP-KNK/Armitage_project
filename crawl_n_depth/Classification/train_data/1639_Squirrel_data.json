That depends on your view on interest rates. ", "To figure it out you need to decide whether two consecutive 1-year rates will outperform the 2-year rate? The break-even is a 1-year rate of 6.00% in one year\u2019s time. With two 1-year rates you\u2019d get 5.60% followed by 6.00%, which would be equivalent to having fixed for 2 years at 5.80%. The 1 year and 2 year rates offer similar value-for-money. I\u2019d take the 2-year rate because the 1-year term is simply too short and comes around again too quickly. ", "How about a 3-year rate at 5.95%? If the first two years is at 5.80% then for breakeven the 1-year rate in two years time will have to be 6.25%. Will rates go up by 0.65% over the next two years? Probably. The 3-year rate looks like excellent value for money. ", "How about a 4-year rate at 6.50%? If we can get three years at 5.95% then the 1-year rate in three years would need to be 8.15%. That is unlikely. From the basic analysis above the 3-year rate at 5.95% looks like the best option based on my view that interest rates will only increase slowly. ", "These forward looking interest rates are referred to as implied forward rates and are useful to understand what level of rate increases are being priced in by the market. Understanding the implied forward rates is the first step. The second step is taking a view on future interest rate increases. There is not a 1:1 relationship between the Official Cash Rate and fixed rates. We can easily misinterpret rates. If the cash rate goes up by 1.00% (from 3.50% to 4.50%) then fixed rates wont necessarily increase as much. I think we\u2019d end up with a 2-year rate around 6.50% (about 0.70% above what we are getting now. Fixed rates factor in future rate increases. Even if the OCR went up 1.00% over the next year, given our benign environment, reduced diary prices, and over $200 billion of mortgage debt awash in New Zealand, I\u2019d not expect rates to keep increasing rapidly beyond that. ", "The other important factor is that bank profits are driven by the spread between lending and deposit rates. Deposit rates are unlikely to increase as quickly as the OCR. If the OCR went up by 2.00% then deposit rates (and fixed mortgages rates by association) might only go up by 1.00%. So even with a \u201cneutral\u201d OCR of 5.50% we\u2019d still have 2-year fixed rates below 7.00%. That\u2019s why the 4-year and 5-year fixed mortgage rates look way out of the money even at 6.50%. I\u2019d only be fixing for that long if I really, really needed the certainty or if I had a large property portfolio and wanted to spread my interest rate maturities. \u00a0", "Subscribe to our newsletter to ensure you're the first to get the latest articles and insights from the Squirrel team", "Interest rates are still low and the housing market seems to be thawing out after a slow 2019.

One way is setting up a revolving credit. This repayment method acts in a similar way to a huge overdraft or transaction account, where you pay your income straight into your loan and draw on it when you need to pay the bills - up to a certain credit limit.Some people want flexibility with their home loan. People who are self-employed, work primarily on commission or otherwise have a volatile income would need to make sure their loan works around that. One month they might be able to make additional repayments, while the rest of the time they might only be able to make the minimums. You'll always want some certainty in regards to being able to make your repayments consistently, but some people might prefer a greater level of flexibility with their loan to take advantage of their highs and mitigate their lows.", "The benefits to this, particularly for those on variable income, is that you can use as much of your income as possible to ", "knock down your debt", " and reduce the interest you are paying.

The issue is that with a fixed loan, you don't get any benefit at all from a drop in interest rates, and many lenders won't allow you to make extra repayments on your loan - something that could extend the lifetime of your loan beyond what is strictly necessary.Certainty, on the other hand, is something that people who are working with a lower income (or a relatively high debt-to-income) might want to put the emphasis on. Young families with lots of new expenses on the horizon (school and the like) could also benefit from a level of certainty.", "Instead, our typical process is to split your loan, so you can have the best of both worlds. In the current low-interest environment, there are plenty of reasons to stay variable, but keeping some of your funds fixed means that you aren't quite so reliant on the whims of the interest rates.", "So there you have it: How do you structure your loan? Awesomely! You don't have to pick between flexibility and certainty when you can have both. Keep some of your loan on fixed to retain consistent expenses, and keep the rest on a revolving credit to ensure that your income helps beat down some of your remaining debt.", "But, as we said, every person is different.

This part of Hendon Ave is quite nice but another 500m down the road it gets more \"interesting.\" I really like the area and it will get a lot of investment in the future as the streets and parks are developed as a consequence of the motorway. The motorway will also eliminate much of the through traffic that currently uses Hendon Ave as a short cut from Mt Roskill. We purchased the place for $551,000. RV at time was $590,000.

For example our contractor got the house on site and was fairly impressive to this point but getting the house on piles was rip, shit and bust. The quality of the finish was below what we'd expect and there were lots of hidden extras in terms of cost. The price quoted included foundations but excluded replacing the bearers or for fixing to the foundations. A lot of damage was done to the electrical wiring under the house and most of this will now need to be redone. We paid extra for new bearers but this still excluded the verandah which looks like we'll need to do ourselves. They wanted to pour the piles and lower the house same-day. Luckily we had an inspector handy who forced the issue and they had to wait for the piles to set properly and lower it the next day. Getting the house on site was quick. Getting it down and fixed took another 5 weeks. This isn't normal but highlights the problems of paying the whole cost upfront.

With this in mind I thought I would explore the question that so often arises: ", "Should you put your house on the market and then go searching for a new place or search to find your dream house and once found put your house on the market? ", "As ever when it comes to property buying and selling there is never a single, nor simple answer; partly because every purchase or sale is a unique experience with a property that is never the same nor the specific circumstances of the buyers nor sellers. One fact that favours finding your next home before putting your home on the market is the fact that at any one time only around 1 in every 30 homes is actually for sale, so if you were to make the decision that you wanted to move house in the next 6 months you would have to accept the fact that the perfect house for you may not come onto the market in that period. Worst of all, that perfect dream home might come onto the market immediately after you have bought your next house! So starting your house hunting early and watching the market regularly is sound advice if your needs are specific and the property you seek is not on the market that often. This fact is partly why over 150,000 people every day in NZ check out property for sale online. ", "As ever there is a downside to this approach as can be seen in the property market being experienced particularly in Auckland at this time, is that a property coming on to market, especially one that is sought after, is likely to only be on the market for a couple of weeks and end up being sold by auction. This situation can therefore lead to incredible stress as such a situation would require a fast process to get your own house onto the market so you could be in a position to bid at auction for your dream house. Don\u2019t be overly fearful of this situation though, because there is nothing stopping you negotiating prior to the auction a side agreement with the vendor through the agent to a longer settlement or even a lower deposit to assist and provide you with more time in which to get your own house sold or ease the financial circumstances around the deposit. ", "Taking the opposite strategy of putting your own house on the market first before you go searching certainly can reduce some of the stress. In doing so you will be able to assess the market demand and price for your property and with a negotiated delayed settlement you could put yourself in a very strong position as a cash-buyer to negotiate a good deal if the market suits that situation. Clearly though this approach has the negative perspective that firstly you will certainly have to restrict your selection of property to just those that are on the market and you will also have to be wary of a looming deadline of that date by which you will have to settle on your own house. ", "As ever in both of these situations you will be in the hands of the market \u2013 that is a buyers\u2019 market or a sellers\u2019 market. In the recent year we have been witnessing a very strong sellers\u2019 market which would have encouraged you to put your property on the market once you had found your next home in the certain knowledge that you could sell your own home quickly. However this very fact of a sellers\u2019 market resulting as it does from limited availability and strong demand, has caused some sellers to actually hold off selling because they fear selling their own house too quickly and not being able to find a suitable house matched with a sense that the market is racing at too fast-a-pace for them. Equally when we at some stage again in the coming year or two experience a buyers\u2019 market to enable you to take advantage of the buyer strength in negotiation, you will have had to sell before you can leverage this situation which is tough in a market with high inventory of available properties on the market and a limited demand from buyers. ", "So as stated earlier there is no single or simple answer to the question. The best advice is to choose to move when it suits you and your circumstances. Plan early and watch the market to be better informed as to the trends and state of the market, know what property you want to buy and where. Get your own house ready to sell and then jump in! The fact is there is no perfect time to buy or sell as you will likely buy and sell at the same state of the market \u2013 rising or falling you will benefit in some way and loose out in some way.

Based on his last year\u2019s financials, he pays an ACC levy of $3,440 per annum and for that he will be covered for up to $64,000 per year if he has an accident and cannot work. John also has good \u00a0income protection cover which will also pay him $64,000 should he have an accident and be off work. Income protection will also cover for illness and mental health, in this case, John pays $2,500 per annum for his insurance premiums. In this situation the benefit from John\u2019s income protection would not be paid out because it would be offset against his ACC income. John is effectively unnecessarily paying $5,940 per annum on cover. Therefore John is better to change his ACC plan by lowering the amount of cover. John opts for the minimum level of cover of $24,544 which costs $1,415 per year in levies. He still has the same amount of accident cover but his total cost has reduced from $5,940 to $3,915.", "If you\u2019re a business owner, it\u2019s really important you get some advice around ACC and the ", "team at Squirrel", " can help you.

However as ever something as significant and life-changing should not be acted upon based on one piece of advice without a good degree of supporting facts. So to help you understand why I believe this is the case, here is my supporting evidence based on 4 key suppositions:", "Actual property prices are at best growing slowly and more likely quite flat and likely to remain fairly flat for sometime to come. This may not at first seem like a logical platform on which to base a suggestion that it is a good time to buy, but continued rising prices as we have seen particularly in Auckland eventually tend to dissuade buyers especially after prices have been rising for some time and people become wary of prices being too high. A fast reducing pool of buyers tends to favour the brave set of buyers who see value in the longer term. My view in regard to property prices is that the headline statistic of median price is misleading. Whilst it is still showing double digit growth, this is actually largely a function of the impact of the LVR restrictions which have severely depressed the low price segment of the market which has thereby artificially raised the median price. This scenario of real prices being flat whilst the media reporting of historical prices showing significant growth is going to change sharply in the coming months and can therefore be seen as a valuable point of leverage in negotiations with sellers who find that the vibrant inflation-heated market appears to have deflated fairly quickly.", "The reporting of levels of new listings coming onto the market continues to tell us that there is a shortage of property for sale. This is not actually the case. As compared to 5 or 10 years ago there are less properties on the market, but then there are less sales occurring and in this regard real estate agents tend to have poor memories whilst at the same time having a vested interest in supporting the view that there are shortages in order to attract new listings. There is a healthy level of stock out there in the market, with if anything a growing number of new listings, this means that a buyer has relatively good choice and should feel less pressured in fear of not finding the right property. This is a point of leverage in negotiation.", "Interest rates are rising and will continue to rise in the next couple of years. This is something that actually provides certainty at least in managing any downside risk. However there may be some upside if the speed of these increases slows and we don\u2019t see four, quarter point increases a year in the coming year to 18 months. If you plan for these increases within your ", "borrowing calculation", " you can approach the next 3 years with greater certainty. A certainty that could be to your advantage as the relatively low interest rates we have enjoyed for the past 5 years have become the norm and the recent increases will potentially dissuade buyers; thereby leaving you with a great opportunity to be seen as a credible buyer just as sellers realise their position of strength they have for so long held in the market is weakening. Time for that serious negotiation on price.", "People love visiting open homes on summer days and agents love showing off homes on summer days, but look behind the veneer of open home visitors to genuine buyers and see this time of year as the opportunity to seek out properties which are being marketed by sellers who tend to be more realistic about selling during the winter months as the motivation for them is clearly sell now for whatever reason rather than wait like everyone else for the \u2018spring season\u2019. Avoid the crowds, get out and view properties and leverage the lessening demand seen in the winter and make a smart buying decision. Overall I hold the view that this is a good time to buy. There is though only ever one certainty when it comes to property forecasting and that is the certainty of uncertainty! and therefore making predictions is virtually impossible. However if you have made the decision that homeownership is your goal and you have the financial status to afford a mortgage at those future interest rates then you would be wise to get out there and leverage the advantages I have outlined.

Resolutions aside, the new year brings with it some fresh changes to the RBNZ lending restrictions which in my opinion will have very little impact on the housing market. There\u2019s been plenty of opinions about what these changes mean and social media groups have been jam packed with \u201cexperts\u201d giving theirs. So, what will these changes mean and what would I be doing as an investor heading into 2018?", "The first change relates to owner occupied buyers. The banks will now be allowed no more than 15% (currently 10%) of their new mortgage lending book to owner occupiers to be at LVR\u2019s of more than 80%. This will effectively double the number of low deposit loans to owner occupied buyers because banks have been self managing their books at about 5% up until now. They\u2019ll likely increase this to 10%, therefore doubling the approvals.\u00a0", "This is a positive change for first home buyers and will give them a slightly bigger chance of being approved. I say slightly, because whilst the LVR restrictions may be easing, bank credit policy remains tight and will do for some time \u2013 in fact I think we will see it getting tighter. I don\u2019t see this LVR change having a significant impact as long as credit policy is tight. Unless some more affordable stock becomes available\u2026 Did someone say Jacinda? Average consumers simply can\u2019t get an approval high enough to purchase at current prices.\u00a0", "The second change is more targeted at investors. The deposit requirement for investors will now be 35% rather than 40%. A positive change that will give new investors more chance to buy and give existing investors access to a bit more equity. Fundamentally though, this will have even less of an effect than the first change. Having a smaller deposit means borrowing more money which, as I\u2019ve said above, is not about to get any easier! This change won\u2019t make a difference to investor behaviour. House prices remain high and regardless of deposit requirements, decent investors will know that in most cases the numbers aren\u2019t there.\u00a0", "That being said, 2018 will be a year of opportunity for those who are ready to take it. There is going to be some pain over the next couple of years and with that will come opportunity. I\u2019m already seeing examples of amateur speculators being caught with land that they paid too much for and now can\u2019t sell \u2013 or they can sell but they simply can\u2019t afford to take the hit on price. There is going to be a lot more of this and unfortunately those smaller time speculators will be the ones to feel the pain. What this means is that there will be some deals to be had for those who are ready. If you can get an approval for more lending, then do that. Then be patient and wait for the numbers to be right.", "So, some minor easing by the RBNZ on LVR restrictions will have little to no effect on the market. It may get some people excited but tight bank credit policy will continue to dictate the state of affairs. Money will continue to be hard to get and will probably get harder.

Banks reported significant drops in housing and lending activity and for us, enquiry was down to frustratingly low levels.\u00a0", "But with the election almost over, warmer weather and spring home loan campaigns in full swing, there appears to be some life coming back in the market. A lot of real estate agents I\u2019m talking to are saying activity is up and houses are starting to sell quickly again.

A recent article in the NZ Herald mentioned that consumers are borrowing at 9-10 times their income level. I\u2019ll challenge you to find a lender approving at that level. Whilst this has absolutely been true of the last few years, it simply isn\u2019t true anymore. Today, with bank test rates sitting at between 7% - 7.9% (principle and interest), borrowing at even six times income is next to impossible. Right now, a first home buyer couple with two dependents and a joint household income of $130,000 (and no consumer debt) would be able to borrow between $650,000 and $850,000 (depending on the lender). Add in any student loan or consumer debt repayments and this number will drop again.", "Rates remain low and they will do for some time to come. I\u2019d argue that we are in a new normal when it comes to interest rates. As I said above, Spring is here and with it is the usual special interest rates. I\u2019d be very cautious about making borrowing decisions purely based on price though. Just because the rate is good, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right place for you to be. It\u2019s a bit like flying with a cheap airline \u2013 whilst it may be cheaper, you may not get where you want to go and even if you do, it\u2019s likely to be a painful experience.", "I see the biggest concern for property investors at the moment being interest only periods coming to an end. If you have looked to extend your interest only period recently then chances are you know what I\u2019m talking about. A lot of the banks will now do a full credit assessment at the time of your fixed rate roll-over and they will do this assessment at their test rate, on principle and interest over 25 years and using only 75% of your rental income.\u00a0 If somehow you pass that test, only then will they extend your interest only period. If not, then be prepared for an increase in your repayments. A $1,000,000 loan switching from interest only to principal and interest would cost an extra $1,808 per month! I\u2019m already seeing investors having to refinance their lending or even sell properties because of this. It\u2019s another clear reason why split banking is crucial in today\u2019s market.

Similarly, monthly expenses also impact on borrowing power, especially other forms of debt repayments. As a first home buyer avoid debt like the plague. For the most part, banks interpret it as living beyond your means. When you add it all up, debt repayments and other discretionary expenses can significantly reduce borrowing power.", "Buying your lunch versus making it, combined with a coffee every day will cost you around $50,000 in borrowing power. That\u2019s because $300 of loan repayments each month equates to $50,000 of borrowing power. It all adds up. Band together at work, and get the boss to buy a decent coffee machine. Cars also make a big difference. The total running cost of a car is roughly $800 per month including depreciation.
