Everyone in the organisation is encouraged to take responsibility for safety in their working environment \u2013 to be pro-active in identifying hazards, notifying and reporting these. Regardless of their job title, everyone in an organisation is viewed as a health and safety leader. Is this true of your organisation?", "There\u2019s nothing quite like recognition that you\u2019ve done your job well.

Does your organisation celebrate the positives?", "A safety issue is an opportunity for improvement, and those managers and supervisors working in a company with a strong health and safety culture acknowledge this. No-one in an organisation should be afraid to raise a query or report an issue, and they should see that all issues are treated seriously by those in leadership roles. Do people in your organisation receive a positive response when they point out a safety or health issue or suggest an improvement?", "Sometimes the only way to become an organisation who has a great health and safety culture is to make sweeping changes.

Can you imagine your organisation making big health and safety changes?", "Just as an employee should be competent in the tasks of their day job, so they should also be competent when it comes to health and safety. An organisation who implements a company-wide health and safety certification program for all employees is one which will have a better health and safety culture. Is two-way communication around health and safety the norm in your organisation?", "Actively engaged employees will use their initiative to suggest new ideas and projects to enhance health and safety. They\u2019ll be more productive, and if they\u2019re properly recognised and rewarded (refer point 3 above) they\u2019ll contribute to the overall health, safety and well-being of an organisation.

Do you regularly see\u00a0communications about health and safety?", "Does your organisation stress that the first order of business at any internal meeting should be a couple of minutes on safety learnings? If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s sending a message that health and safety is not really a high priority.", "Do you have an external auditor who views your health and safety program, reflects on your communications and delivers an honest and open report on how you\u2019re really doing? \u00a0Organisations with a strong health and safety culture welcome the opportunity to show how well they are doing and don\u2019t simply rely on internal checks to verify the success of their\u00a0programs!", "Does your organisation firmly believe in complete transparency for\u00a0any incidents which occur?

Are they measurable so that you know exactly what success looks like?", "If you\u2019ve answered yes to the bulk of these questions, it\u2019s likely your organisation is tracking well towards a sound health and safety culture.
