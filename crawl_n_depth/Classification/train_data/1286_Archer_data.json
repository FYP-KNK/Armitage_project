This was because the heavy aircraft roll over the pop-up nozzles and hangar cleaning practices have changed. In previous years if there was a spill, such as aviation fuel, the floor would be flooded with water to clean it away. These days, with strict environmental regulations in place, spills have to be dealt with in a more controlled and localised manner. This may result in the components being in contact with volatile substances for longer whilst the mopping up procedure is carried out. In addition, although every care is made to keep the hangars clean the nozzles are exposed to wind-blown debris and dirt.", "Archer Operations Director Russell Byrne explains the scientific approach that they had to take with this project,", "\u201cA fire suppression unit is much more than a system pumping out water or retardant in all directions to neutralise an incident. There are strict operating standards. Our new generation nozzle had to deliver a constrained amount of water into a defined virtual space. The MRH90 helicopter fuselage sits lower to the ground than the previous aircraft assets. It is a reduction in height from 900 millimetres ground clearance to 450 millimetres. The width of the spray pattern remained unchanged at 7.5 metres. So, the water had to reach a certain point and not go past it.\u201d", "Archer studied the existing piping system and pump rates. The new nozzle would have to operate under the same flow rates as the current system.

The component can\u2019t be tested after it is installed but should an incident occur it has to function correctly 100% of the time.", "Archer has been developing fail-safe products of all kinds for three decades. We were approached by our customer because they were transitioning from a static fire system which didn\u2019t require a check valve to the more advanced inline pneumatic system. When that older system was activated it simply delivered suppressant for a short time then deflated. The pneumatic system required at least 60 seconds of sustained pressure at the control valve to exhaust nitrogen gas into the vehicle (this is the industry standard). Our customer looked for a standard industrial solution. They found commodity-type valves available on the market but didn\u2019t consider them to be reliable enough. As a result, they came to Archer.", "This valve featured unique demands. Whereas conventional pneumatics systems are cycling \u2013 the valves open then close then open then close, and so on \u2013 this fire suppression unit called for for one-off use. It would only open once when required to suppress a fire and it had to work. What we call \u2018set and forget\u2019 technology. The valve also had to connect to OEM equipment on board the vehicle.", "The project began with research of the fire suppression market and industry standards. Although the vehicle extinguisher market is a mature one Archer was unable to find relevant reference material, as Operations Director Russell Byrne explains, \u201cWe expected to find some data that we could use as a reference point but to our surprise despite the age of this industry there was nothing out there relating to the new type of system required. This meant that our design-to-manufacture phase would be breaking new ground.\u201d", "Having determined the technical requirements of the check valve (i.e. zero fail operation, provide one minute of constant pressure, connect seamlessly to existing infrastructure, etc.) Archer involved many of its specialty areas housed at the Manufacturing Centre of Excellence. Powerful three dimensional design software was used to create the new design. Simulation software demonstrated its functionality. Photo-realistic coloured renders were supplied to the customer. The tiny valve components \u2013 featuring inner and outer threads, complex curves and mirror-finish surfaces - were manufactured from steel in a world-class multi-axis machine centre. As an added benefit an arrow was marked on the outer body by the CNC machine to show air flow direction. The parts were assembled and then operated on a test bench in the laboratory. An air velocity meter was used to confirm gas flow rates to industry standard. Only then did Archer pass on the finished product to the customer.", "Since that time this unit has become sought after throughout the mining industry.

Modifying the system would require it to be shut down for a length of time. Another factor was that the existing valves had a metal to metal seal design which was prone to leaking and the other OEM\u2019s had the same design.", "Stanwell Power Station preferred the option of commissioning Archer to come up with a more efficient solution. This suited us because for many years we have\u00a0specialised\u00a0in problem solving for complex projects and performance-critical systems.", "We presented a solution which involved designing and manufacturing new-generation components which were compatible with the existing system.

These would then be installed in another unit and the \u2018swap out-swap in\u2019\u00a0process would be repeated until all four units were completed.\"", "Aware of the failings of the original valves, we came up with new internal and actuation mechanism designs for their new MJC valve which included a new sealing seat and piston, actuation linkage mechanism and Archer FL505 Glass Bulb Fusible Link - the specialised heat sensitive actuation mechanism which actuates/opens the valve in the case of the valve being activated by heat from a fire. These were incorporated in a valve body designed with the same connection-to-connection dimensions/pattern as the existing OEM MJC valves to allow connection straight into the existing system without modification of existing pipework.", "The improved design offered an additional benefit beyond improved performance. MJC valves require off-site performance testing of a representative percentage after 20 years of service and then every 12 years thereafter. The performance test is a destructive test, destroying the heat sensitive actuation mechanism. Currently all other available OEM valves on the market, once put through this \u201csensitivity\u201d performance test, are not able to be re-built and re-used as the other OEM\u2019s don\u2019t offer the spare parts required nor offer such a service back at their factories. Essentially the MJC valves are scrapped and complete new valves have to be procured - a costly exercise.", "\u201cWe purposely made the new generation\u00a0valves so that the actuation mechanism was modular in design. This means the MJC valves can be re-built and re-used after performance testing by simply replacing the Archer FL505 Glass Bulb Fusible Link on the valve\u201d, said\u00a0Managing Director Bradley Byrne.", "The new MJC valve was designed using latest-generation 3D CAD/CAM software which was integral to programming the tool paths required for the precision machining on our 9-axis Okuma Multus B300-W machine centre.

The valves were hydro-statically pressure tested in\u00a0the\u00a0Archer on-site laboratory and then road freighted to Stanwell Power Station in a purpose built crate for safe and secure transit. The robust crate was specially designed by Archer and allowed for the multiple return journeys to and from Archer and Stanwell Power Station.", "\u201cWhen the first batch of 60 OEM MJC valves for overhaul arrived here we pulled them down and discarded the 20 year old and compromised OEM internal components. The only parts we kept were the gunmetal valve body casting pieces. The castings were cleaned up and precision machined to allow for re-assembly and installation of our proven new generation design and components. The existing OEM MJC valves, having been overhauled to include our design, now included the same benefits of the new Archer MJC valves initially manufactured and supplied for the first swap out-swap-in. Once the MJC valves had been overhauled and fully reassembled they were hydrostatically pressure tested and then sent to Stanwell Power Station for the next unit\u2019s swap out-swap in and we repeated the process again.

The oil flow dilemma was solved and since then the customer has since ordered half a dozen batches.", "Archer has a full-service Manufacturing Centre of Excellence on the NSW Central Coast and was able to conduct concept, computer design, prototyping, modelling, machining and product testing under the one roof.\u00a0", " Copyright Archer Enterprises Pty. Ltd. 2020", "The challenge faced by this customer is common across many industry sectors. Systems of all kinds have components which have to be replaced or removed for servicing and because it has been such a long time since those parts were originally installed there aren\u2019t any records to identify where they were made or what their specifications are\u2026nor are any spare parts available. \u00a0", "Archer\u2019s Operations Director Russel Byrne explains, \u201cWhen systems have been in operation for many years you often find that the original engineers and purchasing managers have moved on. The companies which manufactured those parts have shifted into different markets and don\u2019t hold any more stock, or they have gone out of business. Another common challenge is that operational and safety standards or regulations have changed since the system was installed meaning that any replacement part has to be re-designed to conform. This is a specialty area in which Archer excels \u2013 researching, designing, testing and manufacturing complex parts for very specific functions.\u201d", "The product in question was a fire suppression system nozzle in an ammunition bunker. In order for the nozzle to instantly supply fire retardant foam after being activated it had to have the fluid sitting right behind the nozzle under pressure. To prevent the liquid dropping on to the explosives it needed a quick-release cap. The cap had to be strong enough to prevent droplets ruining the explosives whilst capable of being blown off in a milli-second when the system is activated.", "\u201cThe project required that we integrate a new nozzle into a system which was compliant to operating standards which no longer existed. New standards had been brought in over time. That meant we would have to research the old and new standards, interpret the differences and find the middle ground where there was an overlap of old and new. This narrow window of time would give us the starting point for our design.\u201d", "Adding to the challenge was a tight deadline for delivery.", "Archer began by researching the history of the suppression system components, changes to operating standards and codes, foam delivery performance requirements and other engineering details. Because Archer has been involved in this type of project for more than 35 years (Russell and brother Brad are the third generation of Byrnes running the company) we have extensive libraries of OEM part specifications, international standards for threads, O-rings and other sub-assembly components, as well as the latest industry codes and regulations. From this extensive knowledge base Archer was able to not only replicate the nozzle design but improve on it.", "\u201cWe always ask a lot of questions so that we understand all stakeholder requirements. Some of these questions are outside the initial brief because we want to take the customer on a journey beyond what their expectations are. It\u2019s all about having a big perspective. We don\u2019t just look at the part we look at the functionality of the entire system \u2013 now and in to the future.\u201d", "The design and engineering teams at Archer set themselves the objective of designing a new-generation nozzle with improved functionality over the current model, which would be compliant to the latest operating standards and still able to fit the existing interface. Sophisticated 3D CAD/CAM software was used to design the replacement nozzle. Not only did it allow for rapid design development and precise dimensional accuracy it also meant that the customer was able to review the prototype ideas through a series of photo-realistic 3D colour renders.", "Once the product was approved the components were machined from billet steel in Archer\u2019s Manufacturing Centre of Excellence on a world-class multi-axis machine centre. They were taken to the assembly area and test lab\u2019. Archer simulated the cap being blown off and foam being sprayed on to the target area (there is a strict requirement regarding the nature of the spray pattern).", "\u201cThe Archer design features a tapered nozzle with threading that matches the existing interface. It\u2019s an advancement over the outgoing design. As a result, our client is the only site in Australia with this type of suppression system.\u201d", " Copyright Archer Enterprises Pty.
