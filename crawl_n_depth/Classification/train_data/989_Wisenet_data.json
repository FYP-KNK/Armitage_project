From that day onwards we knew we had something special. \u00a0We jumped in the car and spent the next 2 weeks driving 2,000km from Cairns to Brisbane - calling into colleges in towns along the way - and found that there was nothing out there to help training organisations with better records management and that could collect data for Government reporting.", "By the time we reached Brisbane, we had more than 40 customers!
