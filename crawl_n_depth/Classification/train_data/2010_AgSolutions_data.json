The MegaMin protein blends utilise protected protein meals, which means that from one intake, ruminants can graze longer because the protein in MegaMin breaks down slowly, releasing Nitrogen to the rumen microbes for the digestion of mature fodder, providing a safe and longer lasting option than Urea.", "What about your heifers?", "Many of us have been guilty of neglecting our replacement females whether it\u2019s beef, dairy or sheep. It\u2019s easy to do. Dairy farmers often focus on maximising available feed for the milking herd while heifers run in the back paddock.

In beef cattle or ewes, the end result is a reduction in growth and wool production.", "What\u2019s the answer?", "This is a clear case where supplementing will provide a return on investment. Because the cheapest form of energy is the pasture in your paddock, the best option is to supplement a broad spectrum of minerals with a small amount of protected protein meal to ensure increased intake and better utilisation of available fodder.", "Because pasture will never deliver 100% of the mineral requirements for your stock, MegaMin 10% or 50% Protein Meal blends are a \u2018cheap insurance\u2019 to provide minerals and slow rumen degradable true protein for your stock.", "Supplementing your cows, steers and weaners is certainly beneficial.

To avoid stock losses due to nitrate/nitrite poisoning it is recommended that hungry animals are not given free access to these plants.", "Besides drought there are other soil and environmental conditions that can facilitate the accumulation of high nitrate levels in plants and these include:", "The parts of the plant that are closest to the soil contain the highest concentrations of nitrates.\u00a0 Therefore, leaves contain less nitrate than stalks or stems and the flower and seed usually contains little to no nitrate.\u00a0 The nitrate levels are highest in young plants and decrease as the plant matures. Anything that stunts plant growth increases nitrate accumulation in the lower part of the plant (Thompson, 20200\u00a0", "Certain plant species are also known to accumulate higher levels of nitrate than others and have been associated with nitrate/nitrite poisoning. These are listed in the following table:", "Nitrate/Nitrite Poisoning", "Nitrate is not always toxic to animals, but at elevated levels poisoning can occur. \u00a0 In the ruminant nitrates normally found in forages are converted to nitrite by the digestion process and nitrite is then converted to ammonia.\u00a0 The bacteria in the rumen convert the ammonia to protein that is used by the animal. Ruminants can usually tolerate fairly high levels of nitrate if the intake is spread over the whole feeding day and if enough carbohydrate is also provided to fuel rumen microbial activity.\u00a0 When a large amount of nitrate is consumed it has a caustic effect on the lining of the gut. Signs of nitrate poisoning include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and salivation (Robson, 2020).\u00a0\u00a0", "Nitrite is at least 10 times more toxic than nitrate and nitrite can also be absorbed direct from wet or mouldy hay.\u00a0 If plants that contain high levels of nitrate are rapidly ingested in large quantities the nitrite will accumulate in the rumen and the excess nitrite formed enters the bloodstream where it converts blood haemoglobin to methaemoglobin.\u00a0 This greatly decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and results in the tissues being starved of oxygen. If enough methaemoglobin (which cannot carry oxygen) is produced, the animal will die (Stoltenow, 2020).

In addition, lush green fodder can pass too quickly through the rumen causing scours and reducing the absorption of important nutrients.

If an undernourished horse is then provided with a complete and balanced diet, all of these conditions can gradually be corrected along with an improvement in faster and better hoof horn growth as the horse is now receiving the nutrients required to support this growth.", "When evaluating a feeding program to address a case of bad feet, firstly look into the total feed (energy) intake. Ensuring that energy requirements are being met as well as not being grossly over exceeded is the most important step in hoof growth and integrity. An over-supply of energy can adversely impact on hoof health most notably by sometimes leading to the debilitating disease of laminitis.", "Secondly, as the hoof wall is mostly comprised of protein it is important to ensure that horses receive an adequate intake of high-quality protein.

If diets are fed that are too low in forage or if the hindgut environment is disturbed (particularly when lots of uncooked grains are fed and allowed to ferment in the hindgut) then metabolic issues can arise that ultimately compromise hoof health.", "Mineral Supplementation", "\nVitamin and mineral supplementation must be balanced. For example, feeding too much zinc can also cause a secondary copper deficiency and can result in making hoof quality worse, not better. \u00a0Some pastures don\u2019t provide enough calcium and phosphorus while almost all Australian pastures don\u2019t contain enough copper, zinc, selenium or iodine to support a horse\u2019s requirements, especially for broodmares and growing horses. These minerals are crucial for bone development, muscle function, hoof health, coat colour and the maintenance of healthy cartilage and a strong immune system.", "As most Australian pastures are deficient in some way, the simplest way to correct mineral deficiencies is to use a broad spectrum mineral supplement. For horses to benefit from the full nutritional value of any one mineral, adequate quantities of all other minerals must be present in the diet. Mineral supplements are designed to fill the gap left by pastures without adding excess energy to diets that can lead to problems with hoof health. \u00a0A supplement designed to promote hoof and coat health will be fortified with the following nutrients while maintaining a balanced level of all minerals. When choosing a supplement for hoof health instead of going straight to biotin for the solution, choose a product that contains sufficent levels of important minerals in addition to biotin. \u00a0Balance is the main priority because if copper and zinc are deficient in the diet and causing weak/brittle hooves, no amount of biotin on its own will fix the issue.", "Important Nutrients for Hoof Health", "A number of nutrients have been identified as playing a significant role in hoof health and they are examined here:", "Biotin", " is a water-soluble B-Group vitamin that is synthesised in the horse by hindgut fermentation. \u00a0Supplemental biotin is widely used in the horse industry by owners, trainers, veterinarians and farriers. A biotin deficiency will usually appear in a dull, lacklustre coat and cracked, brittle hooves. Interestingly, there has been no published occurrence of biotin deficiency in the horse to date. Despite this, there is a substantial body of research demonstrating that supplementation with 20mg of biotin per day will result in significant improvements to problematic hoof conditions.

Methionine plays an important role in hoof structure building blocks, particularly of keratin and cell envelope proteins that create cornified hoof wall. Methionine is considered the second most limiting amino acid in the equine diet and a deficiency can negatively impact hoof quality. Methionine works synergistically with biotin to increase the effectiveness of both nutrients.", "Zinc", " is essential for the immune system as well as bone, cartilage and hoof formation and the integrity of skin. Zinc is a component of enzymes necessary for the synthesis of keratins, keratin-associated proteins, cell envelope proteins, collagen and lipoproteins that all contribute to hoof strength and function. Zinc deficiencies retard the synthesis of DNA, RNA and protein, and can lead to dry, thickened skin, retarded growth and hair loss. A shortage of zinc can also impair cellular division and growth and repair of connective tissue.", "Copper", " influences the strength and rigidity of the outer hoof wall\u2019s fully cornified cells and is an important component of antioxidant enzymes that protect cell membranes. Copper and zinc are the most likely trace minerals to be deficient in the diet. Both are involved in many processes, especially with enzymes which must be present for chemical reactions to occur. If either zinc or copper or both of these trace minerals are deficient then slow hoof growth or thin walls will eventuate.", "Manganese", " is involved with carbohydrate and fat metabolism and the formation of chondroitin sulphate in joint cartilage.
