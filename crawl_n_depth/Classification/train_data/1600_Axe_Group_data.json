What we were shown at the time was enough for us to think there\u2019s great flexibility here, the costs were right, and away we went.\u201c", "The project was run in 3 distinct phases, starting with the new business quoting system in 2011, the replacement of their claims system with Axelerator in 2016, and a final phase which will see a complete replacement of the Policy Admin system.", "Initially the company mandated that the team (a blend of developers from Axe, the client and a local software integrator) follow a waterfall approach, but over time as the company gained confidence in the team\u2019s ability to deliver, they moved to an agile development framework.", "The company allocated a fixed annual budget to support a permanent team who could work through a regular pipeline of work under an agile project style. This avoided the stop-start that is inherent with an annual CAPEX approval process. Once the new business project was complete, it was time to look at the claims system.", "\u201cWe had well and truly seen end of life for our Claims as it was an Access database, and as an insurer the claims process is one of our most critical processes. We had to do something that was long overdue and having the experience with Axe on the new business system we didn\u2019t really look for any other options because both the process we went through and the product experience were good enough to simply expand out the functionality and use the Axelerator system to manage both.\u201d", "The pipeline approach to development that had been put in place after the new business phase meant the team had time to continually enhance the system documentation, build an extensive regression testing suite and automate deployments with scripts. As a result, while the initial new business system was a relatively large project with an Axe team of about 10 working for 12 months, the claims project was achieved with a much smaller team of around 4 Axe developers over 8 months.", "Since then, an average of 2 developers and one tester from Axe plus 4 staff from the client have been not only maintaining and enhancing the existing systems but progressively working through the replacement of the policy admin system and data migration.", "Over the next 18 months the replacement of the policy admin system will be completed. This will happen in stages, with first the other online transactions being moved to the front end, followed by the renewal run and premium calculations. After this the back-end system will become the master database that supports commissions, reinsurance, payments, receipts and general ledger postings.", "The final stage will see all the data moved to the Axelerator system, instead of extracting it policy by policy when needed.", "Efficiency improvements have come in a number of areas. Because all functions now use the same code base and system architecture Axe\u2019s developers are able to work on all areas of the solution at once, which means regular releases offering frequent improvements and resolving issues across all systems.", "\u201cWhen we first started we were probably only doing one or two releases a year which were so large they were nearly impossible to test and carried greater risk. Now we\u2019re doing 6 to 7 a year and the business sees the benefit of that. Our key stakeholders are very appreciative of the volume and extent to which we are able to adapt and implement new things quickly.\u201d", "\u201cAnd while we haven\u2019t yet invested time in exploring the potential that exists in our newly connected data in terms of product and pricing changes, I have no doubts that we will be able to do that in time based on what we\u2019ve implemented and the way in which we are capturing the data.\u201d", "\u201cWe definitely see the advantages of having single platform for the entire solution. One system to rule the world, you might say! Some people might argue it\u2019s not a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket going with one vendor.\u201d", "\u201cBut I think the fact that we\u2019ve decided to go down that path and invest in having everything with them and their technology speaks volumes for the product - and the company overall.\u201d", "\u201cAnd in the end, I think that our experience shows that it is possible \u2013 and practical - to progressively replace old technology provided you start with technology that has the potential and flexibility to replace all current systems.\u201d", "Whether you\u2019re looking for an innovative platform to support business growth, you\u2019re over capacity and need to outsource a project, or you\u2019re in a jam and need a rapid solution, Axe is ready to support you.", "Sign up for a demo", "The New Zealand life insurance market has been traditionally characterised by high levels of upfront commission paid to advisors and brokers on the sale of new policies. Following a number of consumer complaints in relation to potential conflicts of interest, the New Zealand government set up an inquiry to investigate the sale of replacement insurance policies.", "The investigation made several recommendations to insurance companies with the intention of improving the quality and impartiality of the advice that consumers receive.", "The regulators also issued a warning to all insurers that regulatory action would be taken if they could not prove that they were complying with the recommendations.", "For our client it was clear that while they were already providing good advice when recommending a policy replacement, changes would be required to satisfactorily demonstrate this to regulators. They identified several system requirements:", "Time was not on their side, according to the bank\u2019s Insurance Systems Team Leader. Unlike other systems changes that would normally be added to a backlog and dealt with over time, the regulatory nature of this change meant the bank needed to be fully compliant and operational within 6 weeks.", "\u201cThe pressure was really on the timeline and the delivery. It was key that the developers knew the platform and the core code. This would have taken time we didn\u2019t have if we had to get a new team up to speed. Luckily we were able to call on the expertise of the Axe team.\u201d", "Because of the tight timetable development needed to start on day 1, with no time to perform a full business analysis exercise. \u201cWith a permanent support team already in place, Axe were able to define the key requirements upfront in a rapid 4-day workshop. They continued to define and clarify the requirements over the 6-week agile development period.\u201d", "As every new requirement was uncovered it was added to a series of automated test cases which meant the team could maintain a high quality, stable build throughout the development cycle.", "\u201cFrom our perspective this meant changes could be made right up to the production deployment without the risk that errors would filter through to production. In a regulatory-driven environment like this, that gave us real confidence in the outcome.\u201d", "While the requirements were seemingly simple, the devil was in the detail. \u201cBecause there are many small decisions that a customer needs to make, changes needed to be made at almost every step of the process, from needs analysis through to policy issue.\u201d", "These included:", "As the first New Zealand Insurer to implement the recommended changes to their sales process, the company gained a marketing advantage, while enhancing their reputation with the regulators.", "A side benefit was that the changes helped staff to understand their role and provide a better service, while customers appreciated the additional insight into the benefits of moving their insurance.", "\u201cLuckily Axe is very flexible. Because they had the capability to divert people from other projects onto this, we were able to immediately mobilise a team for four days of intensive workshops, and within 6 weeks it was all done.\u201d", "Whether you\u2019re looking for an innovative platform to support business growth, you\u2019re over capacity and need to outsource a project, or you\u2019re in a jam and need a rapid solution, Axe is ready to support you.", "Sign up for a demo", "When you\u2019re performing hundreds of thousands of life insurance premium rating requests each day from agents\u2019 planning systems having many small steps in the process mean delays can quickly mount up.", "And for one retail Life Insurance company, focused on providing a great user experience, it was imperative that their agents were able to get accurate quotes as fast as possible.", "As their Head of Projects & Strategic Delivery explains, \u201cas far as we were concerned what we were offering wasn\u2019t optimal. The technology we were using at the time required a number of steps to send a request, receive and display the result, which meant the overall response was relatively slow.\u201d", "At the time they were using Axelerator\u2019s web service on the main production system to do premium calculations. The challenge was to implement a more responsive, remote solution that met privacy and security guidelines, while still using the existing premium rating rules so the service would always get exactly the same premiums as the main production system.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve been working with The Axe Group since 2008, when we initially implemented the Axelerator system. Since then we\u2019ve worked with them to update its features including the development of an underwriting workbench, an eClaims solution, and the first online application form in the market to allow financial advisers to apply for life insurance cover on behalf of their clients. They are great at developing new features and tools based on feedback from us, and from across the market.\u201d", "\u201cWe gave them our challenge, which was to provide a rapid response rating solution that was easy to deploy and update, and that would offer a low cost for each deployment, as several raters would be needed. Axe were fast in coming up with the solution but what was most reassuring was that they trialled options and proved the solution was viable before we had to commit to any cost.\u201d", "In only 3 days Axe built a working \u2018rater-in-a-box\u2019 that used the existing web service API so there was no rework needed by the agents\u2019 planning software vendors.", "To provide a rapid response and avoid privacy and security issues, the solution was configured to be fully memory resident, with the results deleted as soon as the rating is completed.", "To ensure the exact premium is calculated in every case the premium rating rules and associated tables were copied from the production system. And to provide further certainty, a validation service was included in the solution so that advisers could verify they had selected a valid combination of benefits and options.", "Adding to the efficiency, once the quote is approved the adviser can submit all the quote information and immediately start the policy application.", "To keep costs low an open source Java Application Server was used as well as a lightweight, open source database. The entire solution is deployed in a Docker container which can be easily deployed into any data centre or via the cloud. To keep the rater up to date Axelerator CloudSync automatically redeploys the Docker container whenever the system is updated.", "The overall response rate dropped from over 3 seconds to less than a quarter of a second, with no reduction in accuracy. Further tuning is expected to reduce this time even further.", "Because existing components were used there was little work involved in rolling out the solution, and by using an open source solution for the application server and database the cost of each rater is minimal.", "\u201cEvery project has to meet internal rates of return, based on revenue or efficiency. It\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re happy with the results.\u201d", "As a bonus the client is now not only intending to use this perform rating for external systems but is also looking at revising the architecture of their internal systems to use this solution as their common internal rating engine.", "\u201cAs the business grows we need to find more efficient ways of working and implementing new technologies. Smaller incremental projects like this will help stimulate the internal appetite to take bigger jumps forward. Our continued drive is to transform our business to be more efficient and provide an overall better experience for our people and our customers.\u201d", "\u201cThe Axe Group have the scale and mindset to deliver robust solutions; but the best thing is that they bring us new ideas.
