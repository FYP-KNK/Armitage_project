For example, if you child is overwhelmed by sheer volume of study and workload, you can help by reducing chores that they do at home.

Instead, he found that high levels of performance were caused specifically by this concept of deliberate practice.", "Deliberate practice is very different to what most of us think we are doing when we\u2018re at the driving range or jamming on a guitar. Deliberate practice has three characteristics:", "The first and most crucial element of deliberate practice is that it is designed to improve our skills, or even more specifically, one single skill at a time, and in doing so improve our overall performance. In other words, we are not simply sitting down to write an essay or do some practice questions, we are seeking to improve one\u00a0", "specific aspect of essay writing", "This isolation of skills is an important element of training for a sport. Rarely does one go to football or tennis training and just play a match. Instead we tend to spend time practicing isolated skills. For example, at tennis practice we might spend 15 minutes practicing volleying at the net, or at football training we might practice tackling.", "Although this is normal when training for a sport, students do the exact opposite when they attempt to practice or train for exams. Instead, they simply sit down and write essays or do Maths questions, the equivalent of simply playing a match.", "Let\u2019s take English as an example. Writing an essay requires many different skills: structuring an introduction; structuring a paragraph; using compelling evidence; analysing the evidence and using the vocabulary of the subject. Rather than practicing all these skills you might decide to target a specific area you had trouble with in an exam, such as writing a clear introduction for example (check out our English Video Series ", "here", ").", "Secondly, you want to try and find a set of tasks that you can do repeatedly. Anyone who has played golf knows that hitting a ball well once doesn\u2019t mean that we have mastered the sport of golf. It is the same at school. By repeating the task you are able to evaluate whether you have really improved or not.", "More importantly though, repeating the task over and over allows you to develop muscle memory. A top golfer\u2019s swing becomes a subconscious action after a while through the process of constant conditioning and repetition. It is exactly the same for students. This doesn\u2019t mean that our English student from the example above should aim to write the same introduction over and over, but instead they might get four or five practice questions and write a number of different introductions, thereby isolating the skill of writing introductions.", "Thirdly, the task should have a clear outcome or a specific goal. Without this benchmark, you will have no way of ascertaining whether you have actually improved, which after all is the purpose of the practice. So, our English student described above may attempt to get a mark of 80% or an \u2018outstanding\u2019 comment from their teacher. Beyond allowing you to evaluate your performance, these goals also help you to develop the motivation to actually do the work.", "Immediate feedback is crucial in order to be able to determine whether you are performing the task correctly. By comparing your results with your goal, you can determine whether you have improved. Getting feedback to Maths questions is extremely easy and simply involves looking up the answers at the back of the Maths book. For humanities subjects you may have to give your work to your teacher to get marked.", "Feedback does two very important things though. Firstly, if your performance has improved, you will develop a sense of accomplishment that serves to increase motivation. One of the concepts we will be discussing frequently in our articles is the concept of\u00a0\u201cSmall wins\u201d.\u00a0Small wins are those little accomplishments that make you feel good that you spent the time on a task and encourage you to come back and do it again. This is a simple source of motivation. Secondly, if your marks do not increase, you have the opportunity to consult with your teacher and address the problem.", "As noted in our article ", "\u201c", "How smart do you have to be", "?\u201d", ", you should not conceptualise your abilities as being finite and you should not think of your ability to do well as being controlled by concepts such as IQ or talent, both of which are out of your hands. Instead, you should focus on the concept of strategies. If you are not doing well, it isn\u2019t because you\u2019re stupid but rather because your strategies are flawed.", "Deliberate practice is one of the easiest ways to realise this. By focusing on constantly addressing and improving areas of weakness through deliberate practice you will begin to realise that not only is it possible to improve your marks, but that your potential is far greater than you previously imagined.", "\u201cIf you have bad technique and you shoot a basketball a thousand times, all you are going to get good at, is shooting really badly.\u201d \u2013 Michael Jordan", "From smart phones to social media and everything in between, we all know how hard it can be to concentrate these days.

This first step is the easiest of the memory steps, but interestingly the one that most students have the greatest difficulty with, as most students find themselves studying whilst surrounded by a range of distractions.Research shows that these distractions serve to limit the amount of information that students can remember and recall in an exam and \u00a0therefore how will they do in the exam room. As such, students should think of TV, radio, music, younger siblings, phones, text-messages, Youtube and the latest photos or updates on Facebook not just as distractions, but as the causes of lost marks.", "The most obvious solution to the problem of distractions is locating students in environments without distractions such as a study or a bedroom. But in many cases parents don\u2019t promote or encourage this for two mistaken reasons:", "The belief that their children, as members of Gen Y or Gen i, have been born with an innate ability to multi-task. This belief has become increasingly common as the media increasingly discusses the tech savyness of children. However, one of the problems with this is that your children\u2019s brains haven\u2019t taken an evolutionary long-jump in the last 10 years. Just because students have unprecedented access to data and information, doesn\u2019t mean that they can effectively process or use that information. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. Research by Oberauer, Lange and Engle (2004), shows that students who multi-task have lower levels of memory retention and recall than students focusing on one separate task, reinforcing the need for students to remove distractions and resist attempting to multi-task.", "Secondly, the mistaken belief that because you can multi-task as a parent, that your child should have the same ability. Unfortunately, research by Oleson, Macoveanu, Tegner and Kingberg (2006), shows that the ability to block out distractions increases with age which means that whilst you may be able to block out background noise, your children are much less likely to be able to. As such, every time the volume on the TV spikes for an ad break, the kettle boils or the phone rings, their attention is disrupted and their ability to memorise what they are working on drops.", "So the challenge for you then we will be helping your child remove distractions. These are our tips for creating a study environment free from distractions:", "Help your child find a space in which study will be removed from the hustle and bustle of life at home. This location might be your child\u2019s bedroom, a separate study if you have one or simply a room as far away from the TV as possible.", "Our ability to pay attention is based not only on the disruptions around us, but also on our physical state. Often the environment in which we work has a direct impact on our physical state, the obvious example being students doing homework on their bed or lying down on a couch. Unfortunately, if students are lying down, their bodies will begin to go into sleep mode and their attention levels lower (take reading a book in bed and drifting off mid-page as the best example!). The same thing happens when students are studying in a prone position. As such, maximise attention by ensuring that your child\u2019s study location has a desk or table to work at.", "Clean the desk: Study is rarely fun, to the point that any object within easy reach will automatically become worthy of attention and serve as a distraction. Remove these distractions by getting rid of all objects on or near the desk.", "Be your child\u2019s ally and help them filter out distractions. Keep younger siblings away. Monitor TV volume. If your child is working in a shared room near the TV buy them so noise blocking headphones that they can use to block some of the ambient noise out.", "Because of the fact that almost everything is more fun that study, the temptation to keep disruptions within easy reach can be too much for most students. Students will study at a desk, but then have Facebook open on the computer in front of them. Some students will attempt to delude themselves by having an alternate browser page open and Facebook hidden from sight. But sure enough, after 5 or 10 minutes, their self-control collapses and they open the Facebook window to see what\u2019s happened in the last few minutes (the answer is normally not a lot!). The same goes for those students who sit with phones on their desk who check the phone immediately as soon as a message is received. If distractions are nearby they will win!", "The question is then: how do we get rid of these distractions? The obvious answer is we tell students not to have distractions close at hand. The problem with this advice is that you know it won\u2019t be followed. Instead, we have found that if we can\u2019t get students to do the right thing all the time, we can at least get them to do the right thing when it really matters. We do this by helping them self-select.", "We tell students that there are two types of work they have to do: high powered brain work and low-powered brain work. The low-powered brain work consists of homework and repetitive tasks. For this type of work it isn\u2019t ideal that they have their computer on, or a phone at hand, but if they do, it isn\u2019t going to be the end of the world either; it will simply mean that what would otherwise take an hour to do, takes two hours instead (not an efficient use of time, but hey it\u2019s their choice!). On the other hand, students are also going to have high powered brain work. This is the stuff we have discussed above, like memorising notes and practice papers. When doing this type of work students need to remove all distractions. Unfortunately, that means not only is the phone off, but it is in another room. Similarly, the computer will be turned off and preferably in another room. In these moments of high powered brain work, all students will have in their study environment is a desk, a lamp and their notes. As we say, it isn\u2019t perfect advice, but by cutting some slack we have found that students tend to do the right thing when it really matters, and in an imperfect world, this is probably what counts.", "\u00a0", "Because of the fact attention is tied to our physical condition, it is important that students take regular breaks as well. Don\u2019t expect your child to lock themselves in their room for hours on end. Instead, encourage your children to take regular study breaks. But again, in order to ensure that a study break doesn\u2019t turn into another set of endless distractions, help your child master the art of the power break. The power break is a 5 to 10 minute time-out in which they might go outside, kick a ball, do some push-ups, make a cup of tea, or anything else which gets them up and about. What a power break does not consist of is sitting down to watch TV or jumping on the computer, because you can guarantee once a student has been disrupted there will be no return to study", "If all else fails and Facebook and Youtube are winning the battle for attention, here is a handy little trick.

As they already tend to have broad or poorly defined goals, you have something to work with. Options include getting students to read through university handbooks (available online at all university websites), as this gives them a clear picture as to whether their general post-high school goal is what they thought it was. They also require a serious discussion, which can be with parents, or parents and the school careers coordinator, about the grades required in their subjects to generate the entrance score they need for their goal. If their current grades have them on a trajectory which will miss out on this entrance score, this often serves as a motivating wake-up call to increase their efforts with study.", "Unmotivated students tend to lack motivation due to a lack of direction for their careers after high school.

This will involve getting them passionate about a type of career or vocation that they can see themselves doing after high school. There are many ways to get this process started. Some of the easiest involve taking your son or daughter to university open days, where they can see university pathways mapped out, and experience a tangible taste of university life. I would even suggest having them sitting in on a university lecture if possible. Other options include having them sit down and speak with your friends and colleagues who work in different industries. For example, if a friend of yours works in an engineering firm, and your son finds maths to be one of his stronger subjects, having the two sit down and discuss what it is like to work in the industry will potentially sow the seeds of a more specific and defined goal, i.e. to get into engineering at Monash University, later down the track.

All they need to do is to figure out what they are doing wrong, how to fix it, and then not make that mistake again! They can do this by speaking to their teachers about the mistakes they are making.

The question is the extent to which they are stressed, because a little bit of stress is actually quite useful at this time of the year. The best way to help your child manage stress is to identify the reason they are stressed so that you can tailor your response. For example, if you child is overwhelmed by sheer volume of study and workload, you can help by reducing chores that they do at home. If they have a part time job, perhaps they can take a break from it during the exam period. You can also help them by assisting them in creating a study planner where they can break down their subjects into a series of specific tasks that can be ticked off a list and provide them with a clear sense of progress. It is also worth enquiring about our stress reduction sessions that our", " private study coaches", " run with students.\u00a0A private study coach can sit with your child and identify the specific triggers that lead to stress and in turn, give them a suite of options they can use to tackle that stress and keep it at bay.\u00a0", "Previous research has found numerous benefits to listening to music before performing a task \u2013 it improves attention, memory, and even mental math ability.

The next question that I pose to students is \u201cWhy?\u201d Invariably the response is that most students simply don\u2019t feel they are smart enough to get a score in the hallowed 90s.", "\u201cSmartness\u201d, or IQ, is the most common explanation students and parents seem to have for a student\u2019s success, or lack thereof, over the final years. We tend to assume that the top students get the top marks because they are simply smarter than anyone else. This positions the final years of school as a simple IQ test and this paradigm or belief has a number of negative consequences. First of all, it implies that the students have no personal control over how well they do; after all, a student either has a high IQ or they don\u2019t \u2013 there isn\u2019t a lot they can do to change it. Similarly, students with high IQs are lulled into a false sense of security, whilst other students who perceive that they have lower IQs feel that it is pointless to even try.", "As a parent, the belief that IQ will drive a student\u2019s success will also have negative consequences, as it impacts how you relate to or communicate with your child across the year. Often parents counsel their children out of goals that they feel are overly ambitious for the child\u2019s intellectual capacity. Subtle (or not so subtle) conversations of this sort serve to reinforce a student\u2019s perception that they have no control over their marks at the end of the year. This lack of perceived self-control is only likely to increase a student\u2019s anxiety and stress levels.\u00a0", "Most importantly, IQ does not satisfactorily explain why the top students do well.", "Ulric Nessier, the Chair of Psychology at the University of Emory, found that IQ only explained 25% of the variance in school grades and concluded that, \u201csuccessful school learning depends on many personal characteristics other than intelligence\u201d. If IQ was the primary driver of high school performance we would expect that ATAR rankings would mirror IQ scores, something that we simply do not see. As Kakkar notes, \u201cThere is not a single case of 1 to 1 relationship between IQ and academic achievement and a good many cases where there is a wide disparity between IQ ranks and ranks of academic achievement.\u201d", "The concept of IQ emerges from a series of tests used to measure different dimensions of intelligence such as arithmetic, comprehension and vocabulary. Those carrying out the tests found that people generally scored the same results in each different dimension, leading the testers to conclude that there must be some kind of general intelligence that explained this performance. It is this general intelligence, or g, as it is known, that IQ measures. However, as Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi from the University of Chicago explains, these IQ measures relate to convergent thinking. What this means is that IQ is fantastic for problems that are highly defined and have one correct answer. Maths and chemistry provide examples of subjects where these types of problems are common. However, IQ is less appropriate for problems that have multiple answers or problems that require an individual to shift between different perspectives or consider multiple viewpoints and it is these types of questions that make up a signification proportion of the exams students will sit. For example, there are no correct answers to questions regarding \u2018Hamlet\u2019s madness\u2019 or the importance of a particular piece of art. These types of questions require a student to think divergently and this is a capability that IQ fails to satisfactorily measure.", "Beyond this, doing well in the final years of high school requires a range of other skills beyond intelligence. For example, students must be able to motivate themselves, manage their time, manage stress and persist when they have lost marks. As Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence notes, these behaviours are not tied to notions of IQ. Further, they are not innate but rather learned behaviours.", "This therefore poses the obvious question? What does drive success in the final years of high school? Our research has shown that the biggest difference between top and middle or lower performing students is their study habits. Put simply, the top students do different things when they study and they do them at different times, to middle or lower performing students.", "Take exams as an example. The majority of middle or lower performing students spent under a week preparing for exams. The majority of their time in this period is spent writing out notes and if there is time, memorising these notes. The top students on the other hand tend to start their exam preparation a lot earlier. They have their notes finished 2-3 weeks before exams and tend to spend the final week before an exam doing practice papers. This exam preparation routine of the top students results in them knowing the content of a subject better than their peers and most importantly, ensures that they are able to use this content more appropriately than other students when crafting an answer to an exam question.", "This example of exam routine is a simple illustration of 17 areas in which the practices of the top students differ from middle or lower performing students. It is worth drawing attention to the word practices, as importantly, these are behaviours that students exhibit. They are not innate or controlled by natural talent, but rather behaviours that can be learned.", "One of the biggest concepts we focus on with students is that success in the final years of high school is a result of strategies, not necessarily innate characteristics. If we thought of study habits as recipes, then the top students have very different recipes to other students. However, these recipes or strategies are accessible to all students. The focus on the concept of success through strategies is essential as it increases your child\u2019s self efficacy.\u00a0", "This is simply a way of saying it increases students\u2019 sense of control over the year ahead. Most research shows a clear link between a student\u2019s sense of control over their destiny and their levels of stress, anxiety and motivation. Further, students with high levels of control over events are also much less likely to develop a fear of failure and are more likely to persist instead of giving up when they get lower than expected marks, as they realise that low marks are not a reflection of them as people, or a reflection of their ability, but simply a reflection that something went wrong in their recipe.", "As a parent, you can reinforce this sense of self-efficacy by focusing on the concept of strategies as the driver of performance when you communicate with your child. Here are a few ways to do this:", "if your child complains about work being too hard or about not being able to do well because they aren\u2019t smart enough, plant the seed of strategy over IQ. Obviously, we are not saying that your child is going to suddenly brighten up and change tact, but the more we hear something, the more we tend to believe it. Help make the concept a reality in your child\u2019s life by constantly planting the seed.", "All too often, parents try to talk their children out of goals that they have set, because they don\u2019t believe that their child has the academic smarts to achieve their desired result. Unfortunately for students, this underlines the concept that success is driven by innate gifts as opposed to strategies. Although it is only ever done with the best of intentions, do not try and talk your child out of their goal but instead talk strategies with them. Talk to them about how they are planning on achieving their goal. What strategies are they planning on putting in place? What is the process by which they are going to achieve that goal?", "As a final footnote, it is worth noting that we are not saying that IQ is irrelevant. Research shows that students with higher IQs tend to pick up new skills faster than other students. This is obviously an advantage. However, when other skills beyond IQ are going to play a critical role in performance, let\u2019s not get hung-up on it. As research into the process of learning Chess shows, IQ advantages in learning new skills diminish over time, as participants with lower IQs gain exposure to the same knowledge and techniques. Instead of focusing on those areas that are out of a student\u2019s control, we have much more to gain by focusing students on those areas that they can control.", "\u00a0", "From smart phones to social media and everything in between, we all know how hard it can be to concentrate these days.

There is a lot of research into the role music plays in aiding or hindering our concentration. It is generally accepted that some forms of music, such as Baroque music (music composed in the 1600s \u2013 think Bach, Handel\u2019s Messiah etc.) can be relaxing and improve concentration. This is thought to be because the music is so constant in its intensity (it doesn\u2019t often change in volume or speed) that we quickly stop thinking about it, but it continues to block out distracting background noises. Dance and rock music, on the other hand, tends to be the complete opposite, which is why it doesn\u2019t often help us concentrate.
