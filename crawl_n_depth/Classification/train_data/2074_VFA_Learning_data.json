It is this feature that is the reason stretching can improve our range of motion and posture. Unfortunately it takes weeks to months of consistent stretching to elicit such improvements. Fortunately, the elastic properties of the muscle means clients can experience rapid improvements in ranges of motion and flexibility.", "So how long should we stretch for and how often?\u00a0 Well, EVERY DAY! And 1-3 times per day if practically possible. But consistency is the key to improvement.\u00a0 To improve passive ROM and reduce musculotendinous stiffness it has been suggested;", "To summarise the research, at least 30 seconds is the minimum with 60 seconds being a somewhat optimal duration to hold a stretch.\u00a0 Just make sure you focus on breathing throughout to help relax your muscles.", "And how should we stretch?", "Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) is one of the best forms for stretching to see an immediate impact in improvements of flexibility and range of motion. How is this performed? Well a stretch is applied for a duration of 10-30 seconds for a given muscle group, followed by an isometric contraction (tension created within the muscles with no movement) performed for at least 3-10 seconds.\u00a0 The intensity of the contraction should be between 20-50% of maximum effort according to the scientific literature.\u00a0 A subsequent stretch will see (hopefully) an improvement in the range of which the muscle can move.\u00a0 This process can be repeated several times to gain better results (Sharman et al, 2006).", "While the true physiological mechanism may be unknown, the proposed mechanisms for the improvements are autogenic inhibition.\u00a0 This sees a sensory organ within the tendon, known as a Golgi Tendon Organ (GTO) create a response that sees the muscle that has just contracted and created tension, relax and allow the muscle to be moved through a greater range.\u00a0 The initial stretch needs to held for a period greater than 10 seconds, reportedly affecting another sensory organ, the muscle spindle, which responds to stretch causing a contraction followed by a relaxation phase after the extended stretch desensitises the spindles causing relaxation within the muscle (stress relaxation), again allowing it to be moved through a greater range.", "Well literature review articles state no significant injury prevention/protection effect from stretching (Shrier, 1999). It has been stated that \u201cThere is not sufficient evidence to endorse or discontinue routine stretching before or after exercise to prevent injury among competitive or recreational athletes\u201d (Thacker et al 2004, p.371).\u00a0 However continual avoidance of stretching as a part of the weekly training regime will lead to shortened muscles, resisted joints and postural issues that can lead to injuries through repetitive movements under loading.\u00a0 So a stretch before your session may not necessarily results in a reduced likelihood of injury for that session, but over time the effects of poor flexibility and limited range of motion about a joint may in fact result in injury.", "So get stretching!", "By\u00a0David Kinsella, 2015.", "References:", "Safram, Garrett, Seaber, Glisson & Ribbeck 1988, The role of warm up in muscular injury prevention, 16(2), The American Journal of Sports Medicine.", "Young, Clothier, Otago, Bruce, Liddell, 2004, Acute effects of static stretching on hip flexor and quadriceps flexibility, range of motion and foot speed in kicking a football, 7(1), Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport.", "Ryan, Herda, Costa, Defreitas, Beck, Stout & Craemer, 2009, Determining the minimum number of passive stretches necessary to alter musculotendinous stiffness, 27(9), Journal of Sports Sciences.", "Hadala & Barrios, 2009, Different strategies for sports injury prevention in an america\u2019s cup yachting crew, 41(1), Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise.", "@VFALEARNING", " by ", "Janet Boland", " | Oct 9, 2015 | ", "Fitness Articles - VFA Learning", ", ", "News", " |", "Tabata Training- VFA Learning 2015.", "Tabata training is a type of interval training the consists of 20 seconds of high-intensity exercise followed by a 10 second rest period.

For many, it also does a play a role on motivating them to get out and exercise and make better eating choices based on what they see the contestants doing in the Biggest Loser House. It creates exposure for Personal trainers, which are now more accessible and affordable the everyday person and not exclusively for the rich and famous. The more we spread the message and portray the importance of being fit and healthy and get rid of the stereotypes in the media the better it is for everybody. ", "What are the negatives? ", " Whilst it is fantastic that the contestants on the show drop enormous amounts of weight rapidly, it is completely unrealistic for the general public to obtain these kinds of results in that timeframe. A number of the exercises that you see on the show are reckless and dangerous for the clientele they are training. None of your textbooks will tell you that it\u2019s a great idea to give obese individuals burpees, squat jumps and various other high impact activities. These all increase the risk of injury and if you think about the excessive amount of weight these people are carrying, it exacerbates the chances further. If people try these exercises at home without supervision from a trainer, it becomes particularly hazardous. It also gives people a false impression that, at home, they can achieve the enormous weekly weight loss figures that those in the house obtain. This can have a negative impact on these individuals and could result in them giving up. ", "What\u2019s the likelihood of weight gain once they leave such a strenuous household?", " Everyone knows that it is much easier to resist temptation when it is not right in front of you and external influences are eliminated, as is the case when the contestants are in the Biggest Loser house. Making it highly likely that a lot of the contestants would put on some or all of their weight lost on the show. For example, past contestant Artie Rocke went from 160 to 98 kilograms on the show but quickly put on nearly all the weight he\u2019d lost. There are many other examples that I found to support this claim. It is very easy for this weight gain to occur when you think that there is now chocolate in the cupboard, beer in the fridge, work to go to, family to attend and life to live. Making healthy eating choices and including exercise and physical activity in and around these daily occurrences can pose a challenge at times, and the contestants whilst told about what to do on the show, may find the practical application of these lifestyle skills much more difficult to implement when they are out home with no support from the trainers and the other contestants. ", "What can these contestants do to ensure they don\u2019t put the weight back on again?", " We cannot neglect the importance of the psychology behind weight gain and how crucial it is for these contestants to work through their issues and deal with past events that hold them back from achieving their goals. The trainers on the show help to break through perceived barriers and challenge them to believe they are capable of achieving great things which is fantastic, but majority of the contestants need to see a qualified psychologist to assist them through this process and to give them the tools to deal with future events that may cause them to relapse into old behaviour patterns. Also things like setting health and fitness goals in relation to nutrition and exercise will assist them to keep on track with their achievements in the outside world. It is really important for people to set SMARTER goals and to keep a food diary so they are accountable for both aspects of their well-being.", "Joining a health club, support group, sporting or leisure clubs and having the support from people who they surround themselves with on a daily basis will also ensure they have a high success rate following the show.

Utilising a highly developed sense of touch, they identify problem areas of the body. Using gentle stretching and mobilising techniques as well as manipulating joints, an osteopath works with the body to create the perfect conditions to facilitate the healing process.\u2019 Osteopathy treatment involves combined soft-tissue releasing techniques, and some specific adjustments affecting joints and soft-tissues (muscles, tendons and ligaments).", "ANTA also recognises the chiropractic allied health profession and supports its focus on, \u2018diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, with special emphasis on the spine, under the hypothesis that these disorders affect general health via the nervous system.
