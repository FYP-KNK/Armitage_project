Is it possible that one day robots and other forms of AI will totally take over the industry, leaving swathes of contact centre employees out in the cold?", "To the first question, AI is largely still in its experimental stage in Australia. But the results to date have been promising, particularly when it comes to text-based chatbots (or \u2018virtual assistants\u2019, as they\u2019re also called). For customers preferring to have their questions answered via a website than by calling a contact centre, chatbots can provide excellent service.", "When a chatbot pops up to a website, it comes with Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities that allow it grasp the intent of what\u2019s being asked. In other words, it mimics how a knowledgeable human would respond to the enquiry. A good chatbot is also able to seamlessly transfer the customer to a live agent when the conversation gets complicated.", "An example of a successful chatbot in action is Alex, the virtual assistant for the Australian Taxation Office.

Of the 84 Australian businesses surveyed, 73% believe chatbots are relevant to their business. With a solid track record already laid down, and with the technology improving all the time, internet-based chatbots are here to stay.", "While chatbots can be good at providing simple answers to predictable, uncomplicated questions, the stakes get higher when organisations leave it to a robot to address complex enquiries. Companies don\u2019t want to risk losing a long-time customer because of a poor Chabot experience. They also don\u2019t want to fail to convert a prospect into a customer, because of under-developed voice automation technology.", "This is one of the reasons why Australian organisations are treading carefully when it comes to voice-based AI. As things presently stand, robots simply aren\u2019t good at certain things. Through machine learning, they can be effective in understanding what we said, but not necessarily what we meant. For example, AI technology is typically poor at detecting sarcasm \u2013 a response of \u2018yeah, great\u2019 from the customer may not mean what the robot thinks it means. An empathetic understanding of a customer\u2019s emotional state is also not something a bot can easily pick up on. So a customer becoming increasingly exasperated may not be dealt with in the same way as they would if there was a human on the other end of the line. Also, a robot can only provide answers from which it is able to draw from its database of knowledge \u2013 a potential shortcoming when a customer makes a \u2018first-of- its-kind\u2019 type of enquiry. While machine intelligence operates within certain pre-programmed parameters, human beings do not. We\u2019re simply not that predictable.", "For contact centre operators, a key challenge lies in knowing the point at which a customer machine conversation is failing and needs to be taken over by a live agent. If a live person is too slow to get involved, the customer could be lost.", "So until major further advancements are made in AI, its core strength will remain its ability to automate simple processes where human skills and knowledge are not required. This is good news for the contact centre workforce because there\u2019s no way automation is going to replace humans any time in the foreseeable future. Rather than replace live agents, technology can be expected to complement and enhance both the customer experience and the agent experience. That all-important need for the human touch, where qualities such as compassion, an instinct for social cues and a grasp of the unique needs of a particular individual customer, will continue to be vital for organisations dependent on attracting, serving and retaining customers.", "For contact centre representatives, automation will free them from the tedium of continually responding to the same rudimentary queries over and over again. Their jobs will become more stimulating and challenging, allowing more opportunities to apply critical thinking and creativity in their problem-solving.", "For customers who want good customer service and for contact centre service providers, who want to deliver it, the future looks bright. For the most part, Australians are comfortable having their basic enquiries dealt with through automation. Not speaking to a human being is generally acceptable as long as it provides the desired result. In this regard, AI has plenty of runs on the board, and will only get better as its machine learning technology improves.", "For government and corporates, AI has delivered some successes in reducing operational costs, while maintaining solid customer satisfaction rates. With the high cost of hiring and training contact centre staff, the reliable and efficient automation of basic functions has predictably had a positive bottom line impact.", "But there is still some distance to travel along the AI path.

If you have key customer services in the cloud, the moment you hit increased demands you can increase your capability \u2013 all without having to purchase or install any more tech. For example, this means that in peak periods such as Christmas, a FMCG business can instantly scale up their capabilities to meet consumer demand, and then ramp it back down post-Christmas when shopping habits slow down \u2013 all without spending any more on cloud services.", "2) Track and measure smarter", "\nFor any business, big or small, when looking to implement new technology the ability to prove not only ROI on the product, but ROI on service delivery is crucial. Many cloud systems have been established in a way that allows them to track all activity with inbuilt measurement systems. With this, showing ROI becomes as simple as a few clicks.", "3) Get agile", "\nOne of the true values of cloud based technologies is that it enables businesses to become more agile. The nature of cloud business technology means that your office can be anywhere. This lets you work remotely in the same capacity as if you were in the office, or even move offices without reinstalling technologies and systems. It\u2019s ultimately about flexibility on what your company needs, and when it needs it, not what your technology services let you do.", "4) Get it early, get it cheap", "\nCloud technology allows users to have a pay-use-model, which eliminates the risk of over or under investment. In short, pay less and never more than you need to. This helps a business to grow quickly and have sophisticated services in the early stages without spending a lot up front, and reduce IT budgets, while still maintaining quality of service. True cloud services empower businesses of any size to have services previously only available to big business.", "Are you sick of being told that the modern business environment is turbulent? This doesn\u2019t make running a business easy, so having a business plan with resources that can scale up and down is crucial to success, no matter what your size. ", "The ability to scale quickly is being driven by a number of factors, the most common being the adoption of cloud based services to provide flexibility. The Small and Medium Business (SMB) market has particularly fuelled the development of the many and varied types of cloud based business support. In this market, cloud services are expected to grow by 35% annually until 2021. ", "Additional scalability factors include the high usage of mobile devices, flexible work practices and the growing demand for web and mobile applications. \u00a0Each of these factors has driven change. So why cloud technology? How can it help your business to scale and survive the turbulent environment? ", "1. Offsite and secure ", "A main feature of cloud technology is that information is stored away from the business premise. This has a number of key benefits. ", "As well as freeing up space it also centralises information for staff to access freely and remotely. \u00a0Using customer contact communications as an example, the use of cloud technology streamlines the communications process because all staff can access the same decentralised database and can see what has been said, even if they aren\u2019t in a common location. Having one point of information reduces the chances of human error when a business scales up, and ensures all messaging is consistent and is presented with a similar voice. \u00a0\u00a0", "2. Unpredictability of business and seasonal disruption \u00a0", "For some businesses, key planning issues may be seasonal change and volatile sales cycles. \u00a0In these instances new cloud technology enables scalability and flexibility. ", "Specifically for contact centres, the cloud technology makes it easy for call agents to be quickly added and removed when required. This simple flexibility can reap strong rewards for business owners, as they can quickly adapt to the demands of the business. ", "3. Pay as you go model ", "As cloud technology is more adaptable and doesn\u2019t require the structure of hardware, providers can be more fluid with the payment structure and can focus on a continuity model. Traditional call centres generally require a 12 month contract of upfront licences. In contrast, the pay as you go model is driven by the flexibility and scalability of cloud technology. As a result, a pay as you go pricing structure can help to ensure maximum returns at the lowest possible cost. ", "4. Fast to deploy ", "When a business needs to scale, it generally needs to happen yesterday. This is where cloud based businesses come into their \u00a0own. Because there is no hardware, businesses centric services can be implemented in weeks, not months (and for a fraction of the cost).

The traditional on premise solution will therefore be replaced. The whitepaper, in seeking explanations for this growth in the contact centre market, said Australian business owners were being lured by the cloud\u2019s cost competitiveness and increased flexibility.", "These contact centres, which provide a range of services from outbound sales to customer support, are leveraging cloud technology to allow their own employees to work from home.", "Through services provided by companies such as ipSCAPE, contact centre agents can be located anywhere with reliable voice and data connections. Working from home means the daily commute can be measured in metres rather than miles, as well as being able to look after children or enjoy a home lifestyle.", "At the same time, businesses can monitor the activity and performance of the contact centre from their own home or even a smartphone device. In some instances, sales and support campaigns can be activated within days, rather than weeks or months.
