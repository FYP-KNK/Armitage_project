Other modalities can be  incorporated as required or as new needs become apparent.", "Each practitioner is briefed prior to meeting the client but each  will subsequently conduct specific assessments relevant to their  treatment modality.  Formal case conferences are then held twice weekly  with the first case conference held within three days of a client\u2019s  arrival.  At case conferences, each practitioner has the opportunity to  discuss their diagnosis, observations, clinical opinions and treatment  recommendations and to clarify any aspect of their treatment rationale  that might not be understood as well by other practitioners. Where  contradictions become apparent, these are resolved through discussion,  negotiation and consultation with other practitioners.  No aspect of the  client\u2019s stay with us is left unexamined, with carers and chefs also  contributing their experiences of the client so that the treatment team  functions in coordination and in unity.  Our aim is to have all our  practitioners and staff \u2018on the same page\u2019.", "Importantly, every aspect of a client\u2019s treatment is reviewed on a  daily basis.

Once a client is in residence, I am responsible as the  primary liaison for the client on a day-to-day basis, ensuring any  requests are reviewed by the relevant practitioners and generally  ensuring all clinical information is disseminated between practitioners  accordingly.", "I really consider one of the most important aspects of my role as  developing a close rapport with each client:  checking in with them by  fax and daily phone calls, responding to their requests, and making sure  I can create an atmosphere of mutual trust so each client feels they  have an open forum and environment to express their authentic needs.", "It\u2019s important also that I support the personal care staff and  practitioners working with the clients. Often they need regular updates  and clarification of any aspect of the client\u2019s day so that everyone is  \u2018on the same page\u2019 and can respond consistently.  It\u2019s amazing just how  much coordination is required to ensure at the experiential end of the  program, that everything flows seamlessly and seemingly without effort.   There are a lot of complex tiny steps that need to happen behind the  scenes for an integrated program to work.", "Sometimes I describe the work of Client Services as resembling a duck  gliding smoothly through the water.  We try to keep everything on the  surface looking tranquil, smooth and effortless, but underneath the  water, out of sight, there\u2019s a lot of frantic paddling going on!  We  really try to take the stress out of a client\u2019s stay by attending to all  the little things like family visits, extra administration work,  requested outings, departure arrangements \u2013 even dealing with pets.  Our  aim is to remain practical while maintaining a sense of nurturing  responsiveness, for which the Sanctuary is now well known.", "In a sense, Client Services case managers have to walk a fine line  being responsive to a client\u2019s requests and helping the clients maintain  the restraint required to fulfil their overall therapeutic goals.  For  example, it is not necessarily in a client\u2019s best interest to see a  movie with explicit scenes showing drug taking and drinking if they are  in the early stages of addressing substance abuse.

While using drugs and alcohol may be a coping  strategy, it is only effective in the short term and can in fact  compromise long-term recovery by destroying the very nutrients that may  assist in creating a more positive psychological state.", "On the other hand, if appropriate nutrient consumption can be  encouraged, a more positive psychological state will follow, diminishing  the need to resort to drugs and alcohol to cope with anxiety and  depression. Nutrient intake therefore plays an important role in  breaking the addiction cycle.", "To effectively treat depression and anxiety, the body\u2019s natural  ability to produce the \u2018feel-good\u2019 neurotransmitters serotonin and  dopamine must be encouraged and enhanced.\u00a0 As alcohol and drugs  artificially boost serotonin and dopamine levels in the body but deplete  them in the long run, enhancing the capacity of the body to boost  natural production is the only effective long term solution.", "To support the enzymatic processes involved in the conversion of  amino acids such as Tryptophan, Phenylalanine and Tyrosine into dopamine  and serotonin, the use of cofactors such as Zinc, Vit B6, Iron and  Folic Acid are recommended.", "To determine which nutrients are best indicated in treatment, blood  and urine tests are utilised: For example, zinc and iron levels can be  effectively checked in a standard blood test; deficiencies in Vit B6 and  Folate metabolism can also be revealed by high homocysteine levels; and  neuroendocrine (cells that release a hormone into the circulating blood  in response to a neural stimulus) levels can also be measured in a  urine sample to give a clear picture of serotonin and dopamine levels.", "Deficiencies and low levels of nutrients are treated with direct  supplementation and at The Sanctuary Byron Bay, we use a range of high  quality products to achieve optimum nutrient saturation.", "All measures can be checked again after initiating supplementation \u2013  to confirm that adequate absorption is occurring.

It is the Naturopath\u2019s task to assist their clients  to create this lifestyle with the goal of discontinuing supplementation  when optimum health is achieved.", "Good quality protein such as organic meats, fish and dairy produce  all give the body an abundance of amino acids. Whole grains, fresh fruit  and vegetables supply the cofactors necessary for healthy brain  function.\u00a0 Some individuals may not be able to produce serotonin and  dopamine naturally and in those instances supplementation may be  considered long term but at a reduced level after the initial deficiency  has been corrected.\u00a0 If the patient does not have the capacity to cook  fresh nutritious food on a regular basis ongoing supplementation may  also be required.
