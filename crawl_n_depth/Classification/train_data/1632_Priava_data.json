The fact that it was cloud-based was also in its favour as we wanted to be able to access information wherever we are, whether at home or out of the office. We liked the fact that as long as you\u2019ve got the latest browser installed you can use it. The modular nature of Priava was also appealing because we only needed to pay for what we needed.\u201d", "According to Angela the installation was quick and in the short-term both the new and old systems were run in parallel whilst the data was transferred. All training was conducted via the web and there was then a follow-up session a few weeks later, once the team had had chance to use the system. \u201cWe are a relatively small events team\u201d says Angela, \u201cso we can\u2019t afford time out of the office, therefore on-line training was perfect for us. We found Priava really easy to use.\u201d", "The principle driver behind upgrading the venue\u2019s technology was the need for easy and detailed reporting and the collective results in terms of actionable intelligence and operational efficiencies have been significant. Angela says, \u201cWe save massive amounts of time in administration as customised reports can be created almost instantly. In the past it may have taken a couple of hours a week to produce a report as we were often relying on manual methods such as running through the calendar to find out what spaces had been used and how often. Instead we now have multiple types of reports produced at different times of the week or month covering all types of statistics from profit analysis, margins, revenues, volume of bookings or enquiries, number of people that have been in the building, through to repeat business levels. As long as we put the information in, we can get all the figures we need from Priava\u201d", "Priava\u2019s \u2018repeat bookings\u2019 feature is also a real-time saver as a large proportion of the venue\u2019s business comes from repeat customers. \u201cWe only have to enter the details once,\u00a0 the system will then replicate this for future bookings. This is ideal for smaller meeting room bookings that are lower value as you avoid wasting precious time on admin, which takes just as long regardless of whether you are entering a \u00a3200 or \u00a310,000 booking. At the same time it is simpler to raise contracts or invoices at the click of a button, enabling us to channel our time into focusing on more lucrative areas such as sales and client relations.\u201d", "By having a detailed understanding of where revenue is coming from, demand levels, margins and popularity of different spaces, the management team at Cranmore Park can more accurately assess future strategy and direction such as how to expand the facility in the future.", "Technology supports 50% increase in bookings ", "\u201cIn the last twelve months\u201d says Angela, \u201cwe have seen a 50% increase in overall bookings that have been influenced by a range of factors, such as an increase in the size of the events team, greater awareness of the brand and also a positive business climate. To sustain and grow this level of business Priava has played a key role in both logging and nurturing opportunities through to effectively managing events and then measuring customer feedback. The booking and tracking capabilities are fantastic. Once we have logged an opportunity we can also add notes, quotations and set reminders to chase potential bookings.\u201d", "Maximise the return from marketing such as Google AdWords ", "Using Priava\u2019s reporting, the venue can also analyse where business is coming from, whether from direct mail or the web. \u201cWe can see exactly what marketing is working and understand what Google Ad words are most successful, which in turn enables us to optimise their return.\u201d", "Record and act on client feedback ", "Both during and after an event, the Priava solution provides support to both the events and catering teams. \u201cEveryone has complete visibility of exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d Says Angela. Function sheets provide clear and concise information to both the catering/security teams and to the client, and can be tailored dependent on the recipients. Post-event feedback is also captured within the Priava system, so that any comments can be acted on and any changes made for next time.", "Checking availability of ancillary items such as car parking spaces ", "Not only does Priava hold all information for booking and managing events, it also checks availability for ancillary items such as AV hire or the availability of car parking spaces. The latter is particularly vital, as this knowledge can determine on what days the venue is able to host certain combination of events. ", "Faster creation of invoices and contracts", "Once a booking has been taken, Priava also facilitates the necessary paperwork with the speedy creation of invoices and contracts with just a click of a button from within the action tab on the events page. \u201cThis makes life a lot easier for the finance team and reduces their administration time.\u201d says Angela\u201d", "Cloud supports flexible working and frees up internal IT resources \u00a0", "Time is also a valuable commodity for the internal IT team, so by using Priava\u2019s cloud-based system that is fully supported externally, this relinquishes the management responsibility, so they can focus on other systems, plus there is no need to worry about back-ups, as again this is all managed by Priava.\u00a0 There are other advantages too of the venue and event management technology being hosted says Angela, \u201cWith the old system, if the remote access wasn\u2019t working for some reason, then you could not log in when you were out of the office. With Priava it is independent so if you have an internet connection then you can view information.

Office Manager at Merewether Surfhouse, Megan Baird comments on the initial perceptions about the cloud, \u201cWe were a little bit tentative with it at first, not knowing what it was all about and how the information was going to be stored. We wanted to know whether our information was going to be safe, because up until that point we had everything saved on a remote server, which was quite contained. Initially the thought of moving to the cloud was more scary than exciting but when looked into it, we realised that it made a lot more sense for our business. Being able to access the system from anywhere, even at home, and the ability to have lots of different people working from the same system at the same time was far more suited to our needs.\u201d", " ", " Once the decision to move to the cloud was made, the management team looked into a number of different cloud-based providers and in the end it was decided that Priava was the best fit for their business, not only because of the functionality but also because of their existing relationship with the team. Megan explains, \u201cThe advantage of going with Priava was that they already had our information and understood what we needed from a venue management solution. Being able to transfer some of the information that we had in Events Perfect across to Priava was much easier than it would have been if we were starting from scratch with an alternative provider. Furthermore, being able to speak to people that understood our business was a big advantage.\u201d", "\"We can tailor our own reports to display any information we need.

General Manager, Marc Allardice explains, \u201cHaving Priava has negated the need for the specific events server. This has saved over 150 man hours of tech support in the last financial year.\u201d", "According to Megan, one of the biggest challenges with the previous system was that it prevented the team from working together because only one person could access the system at any one time. Using Priava, the team are able to work collaboratively which in turn results in a better experience for their customers. She explains, \u201cIf a customer calls wanting to discuss details or make changes to their event, pretty much anyone can answer their questions even if the specific event coordinator is unavailable because all of the information is easily accessible. Plus we have the ability to add more information, like notes, so that all of our interactions with the client are logged which prevents anything from being missed. Ultimately this makes it a lot better for the client, because they are not having to wait on an event coordinator to help with their query.\u201d", "In her role as a senior manager, Megan also appreciates the flexibility of being able to access the system away from her office as it allows her the freedom to provide remote support to her team when necessary. Megan says, \u201cIf needs be, I can access the system at anytime without having to rely on a remote desktop connection. Instead, I can just log directly into Priava using my own administrator account and see exactly what the team are working on. So if anyone needs support when I am at home or away from my desk, then I can make changes on the fly.\u201d", "The management team at Merewether Surfhouse agree that one of the major benefits of Priava is the fact that it is so easy to use, which in turn has meant that it is also easy to train new staff. Marc concurs, \u201cPriava is a user friendly system which has enabled new staff to easily transition into the team and confidently use the system without a lot of training.\u201d", "This is reflected in the fact that only one person \u2013 Megan \u2013 was ever trained on how to use the system during the implementation stage and she then relayed everything she had learned back to the team. Megan comments, \u201cIt was only ever me that received any training and then I was able to show everyone else how to use it and they picked it up straight away because it was so easy. You only have to look at it and you know what you need to do.\u201d", "When asked why she felt that the system was so easy to learn and train new users, Megan explains, \u201cWith Priava I can just talk someone through the system without even looking at it because it all flows, following a step-by-step pattern which works together to create the whole event. So I only\u00a0need to show someone how to do something once and then they can follow the system.\u201d She continues, \u201cIt even looks like it should from a user perspective and you can customise colours and text to represent different things which makes it not only very easy to understand and use, but also relevant for your business.\u201d", "Not only was the system easy to learn, once they were up and running, Priava enabled the events team to work more efficiently. From a user interface perspective, Megan comments that one of the best features of Priava is the ability to multi-task, \u201cYou can open multiple screens, so that you can work on more than one thing at the same time.\u201d", "Aside from the ability to work across multiple tabs, Megan believes that the Chart is central to their day-to-day operations as it enables them to access up-to-date information about their availability. Megan explains, \u201cThe Chart gives a great snapshot of everything that\u2019s happening \u2013 it\u2019s right in front of you. If you hover over an event on the chart you can see exactly what it\u2019s about so that you can quickly access the information that you need.\u201d She continues, \u201cUsing the Chart allows us to see holes or gaps in our availability which is really helpful for our team when they are trying to respond to questions over the phone, because you can quickly see what is available and what\u2019s not at a glance.\u201d", "As an administrator, Megan is responsible for configuring all catalogue items in Priava for their team to use. Megan believes on of the most significant benefits of the system is that using the Packages module she is able to build set packages and distribute the revenue correctly across multiple items so that it will automatically calculate for her team. She gives an example, \u201cIn our wedding packages everything is included; room hire, AV, food, drinks, chair covers and other items. So I built a wedding package in the admin section of Priava, so that when a member of the team is selling a wedding they simply enter in the number of guests and then the system automatically calculates the rest for them. This means that the revenue for all of the items included in the package is assigned correctly for them so there\u2019s no manual calculation which eliminates the possibility or error.\u201d Megan continues, \u201cThis is the same for all of the items that we sell in Priava \u2013 like catering. Everything is built in the backend, so when someone adds one main meal to an event booking, then all of the information and prices are there and can be printed on a contract or an event sheet for a client to select from.\u201d", "Priava\u2019s sophisticated report designer has allowed Merewether Surfhouse the flexibility to create meaningful reports that demonstrate how their business is tracking. Marc explains, \u201cUsing Priava we can produce detailed reports that have been very helpful in organizing budgets, targets and other financial aspects of the business.\u201d", "Megan agrees that Priava\u2019s reporting feature has had a significant impact on the business. She explains, \u201cJust being able to manipulate the existing report templates and pull out the numbers that we want has saved us massive amount of time and gives us more insight into our business. Plus, we can tailor our own reports to display any information we need. From how many events we have booked, to how many events have been booked by a particular company, to how many confirmed bookings we have managed to convert from enquiries, the reporting capabilities are endless.\u201d", "Merewether Surfhouse have also used the reporting feature to customise templates such booking contracts, invoices, event sheets and other critical documents including key information such as their terms and conditions, which has helped to streamline their event booking processes. Megan believes that this has improved consistency and eliminated discrepancies in the sales and event coordination process. She explains, \u201cEverything is the same, everything is streamlined, every client gets the same information and nothing is missed.\u201c", "\u00a0", "The benefits that Merewether Surfhouse has achieved through the use of the Priava cloud-based venue management solution so far include:", "Aside from all of the functionality in the system, Megan believes that the most impressive feature of the system is the fact that it updates in real-time. She explains, \u201cOne thing that we didn\u2019t fully understand until we were up and running was the fact that the system would update instantly. So when something is updated or changed by a particular user, everyone can see it straight away. We were told that this was going to happen during the demonstration and our trial, but we when we actually started using the system we were still so surprised that it was so instantaneous \u2013 you don\u2019t even need to log out and log back in which is what we were used to doing with the Events Perfect program.

This meant that they were given an opportunity to decide whether they should implement their existing system at the new venue or look for a better option. With so many different staff members working across different locations it was apparent that a centralised system would be needed to ensure all staff had access to the same information in real-time \u2013 particularly in terms of checking venue availability. General Manager, Anna\u00a0Persson, had previously used Events Perfect, Priava\u2019s legacy system, in a previous role and was eager to explore the new cloud-based option.

Anna explains, \u201cWe needed a solution that could be implemented quickly and easily and, given that Priava is cloud-based, there was no need for it to be installed onsite rather we could simply access the most up-to-date version of the system via any web browser.\u201d", "Real-time availability ensures all staff are on the same page", "Anna believes one of the most important benefits of the system is the fact that availability is reflected on the Chart in real-time, meaning all users can easily see what dates and times are available at each of their venues at a glance. She explains, \u201cOne of the biggest challenges we faced when taking on CYCA was the fact that they had been using a different system to the one that we were using at our other venues. Due to time constraints, we were forced to implement a paper-based system in the interim period while we reviewed our options. This meant that we were completely reliant on staff being on site at the venue to check availability and the process was entirely manual. By implementing Priava, all of our staff members can see the availability for all of our venues and any new bookings or changes to our existing bookings are visible in real-time, so we are always on the same page. Being able to check availability there and then, means that we can respond to any enquiries quickly and easily, which means a better service experience for our customers.\u201d", "Cloud-based system is accessible from anywhere", "As the Priava solution is cloud-based, it can be accessed from any device that has a web-browser and Internet connection.

These modules allow them to create customised food/ beverage items and resources that can be applied to events including predefined prices, general ledger codes and commentary. Anna explains, \u201cUsing Priava\u2019s Catering module, we can predefine all of our menu choices which makes it easier for our team to apply food and beverage items to an event, because it limits the amount of data they have to input for each booking \u2013 all of the menus and prices are there, so they can just update the quantities based on the amount of guests that are in attendance.\u201d", "Executive Chef and Proprietor for Blond Catering, Jesper Hansen, uses the Catering module to plan seasonal menu changes. He explains, \u201cWe have all of our seasonal menu uploaded into the system in advance, so when someone calls us now for an event that is happening later in the year, our sales staff can simply look at the system and provide the client with a quotation with the relevant menu choices. This is particularly beneficial for Christmas functions, because people tend to book in advance.\u201d", "Using the Inventory module, Blond Catering can keep track of all of the resources that they have available for hire at their events which gives them reassurance that nothing will ever be overbooked. Anna explains, \u201cUsing Inventory, we can set the maximum quantity for all of the items that we have available for hire and choose whether an item can be overbooked which prevents double bookings.\u201d", "Priava has also recently released a Venue Association feature, which means Catering and Inventory items can be associated to set venues. For example, if a certain menu is only available at a certain venue then users will only be able to apply it to events that have the relevant venue applied to them. Similarly, if a resource such as a data projector is only available for hire at a certain venue, then users will only be able to apply it to events that have the relevant venue applied to them. Anna comments on how this feature has helped their team, \u201cVenue Association has made it even easier for our team to create event bookings because we can clearly see which options are available at which venues. This limits the potential for error, because it prevents our users from being able to add food, beverages and resources to events that are booked at venues where these items are not available.\u201d", "System is constantly evolving based on user feedback", "Another benefit of the cloud-based model is that all system updates are administered remotely, meaning all users will always have access to the latest version of the system.

One of the biggest frustrations of the manual approach was ensuring that once all the consumption sheets were back for different events, the team had to match up the costs and final invoice, so it balanced with the accounting system. In some cases tracking back and finding just a \u00a310 or \u00a315 discrepancy between the two could take literally hours of work.

With the new system and the \u2018New Opportunity\u2019 tab, it is easy and quick to modify the original, rather than reproduce it again and again, which is what we had to do in the past.\u201d\u00a0 Typically Kings Place prepares around 280-300 proposals every month.", "New Business Opportunities \u2013 ability to check availability of venues, anytime, anyplace.", "Compared with the old system, one of the key differences for generating new business is that the team can check availability of its large range of venues in real-time. Lucy comments, \u201cIf we\u2019re doing a tour of our different venues, the team can now simply check availability there and then via their tablet, rather than having to go back to the office. Also when we attend exhibitions, again we can confirm whether a particular room or space is available there and then on the stand.\u201d", "Support for flexible working \u2013 no downtime during \u2018snow days\u2019 ", "Not only can the cloud-based solution from Priava be accessed whilst the events team is on the move, but because it is location-independent it can also support more wider flexible working if necessary.

Firstly, you need to assess how this is currently run. This may be determined by your size or the number of spaces that you have available. Secondly you need to analyse how you might optimise the occupancy or volume of events that are achievable and finally you need to understand whether you can meet these targets with the tools and/or human resources you currently have. Typically if you have a single space then you can achieve most of the day to day management using applications such as Excel or Outlook. However, if you have more capacity or are looking to increase the proportion of events, then it makes commercial sense to invest in technology that can help automate and more efficiently manage the whole process.", "Capitalise on new opportunities", "Many museums and galleries are already beginning to see the bigger picture and recognise the growing contribution that venues can make. Stacey Hammond, Head of Business Development at National Museums Liverpool Trading that runs multiple venues across Merseyside said that they had seen a significant growth in its corporate hospitality and events business over the last few years. This is echoed by others such as The National Museum of the Royal Navy who like National Museums Liverpool has invested in new technology to support and optimise occupancy levels and returns. So what difference can dedicated venue management software make?", "\u201cOne of the key income streams often overlooked and certainly under-valued is what can be generated from the often unique attributes of the venue itself, whether from corporate hospitality hire or hosting other commercial or private events throughout the year\u201d", "Duncan Hilliard", "Senior Systems Specialist", "Priava", "\u00a0", "Get your head in the cloud", "With the right IT on board, the events team can increase their overall efficiency resulting in a higher number of bookings and events. The areas where you will see the largest improvements are likely to be in time-savings, enhanced communication (with both the end customer and suppliers), less administration and in-depth reporting.", "The principal time-savings are associated with training as many of the new breed of software are web-based, and like an \u2018app\u2019 are simple to pick up so if new staff join or new functionality is introduced there is minimal additional training required. Also, if the software is able to integrate with a museum\u2019s website, even booking information can be entered by the customer themselves on-line, avoiding duplication, double bookings or other errors. ", "Be more proactive", "By spending less on administrative tasks, staff can focus on more valuable activities such as speaking with clients and being more proactive in securing new and repeat bookings. With the help of intelligent reporting on occupancy, profitability and types of events that prove popular it also becomes easier to understand key trends, so that the venue team can then react accordingly.", "For example if some spaces are under-utilised then this can then be reflected within the sales and marketing effort. This detailed level of reporting can also highlight where there is scope to expand revenues. One instance of this relates to the quality of food served during events, often a hotly debated subject that can sometimes determine how delegates rate their overall experience. If you can meet or exceed expectations, this can have a really positive effect on spreading the word and increases the chances of repeat business.", "What many museums fail to realise is that if they outsource this element to an outside caterer with top notch credentials, they can always ensure the quality of the menu and they can also benefit from commission. Relying on a network of assured and reliable third party suppliers can collectively make a big difference to the bottom line, especially as the volume of bookings rise.", " ", "Silver linings", " One of the fringe benefits of choosing a cloud or hosted solution is that you can easily support external suppliers, giving them controlled access to the venue management system, regardless of their location. This means that they have access to all the information they need and it\u2019s always up to date, because all the data is held in a centralised place. Managing all your contacts in a single system again saves on needless administration. Such a system also enables you to \u2018up-sell\u2019 more items as part of the entire events package \u2013 from providing a tour for VIP guests to a special exhibition through to suggesting a cocktail and canap\u00e9s reception.", "Equally, using technology that can be accessed anywhere means that it is ideal for museum groups or indeed those that are looking to share resources to save money.

Our two principal venues Arena Manawat\u016b and the Convention Centre are only 2kms away from each other but were using different methods of managing events. The Convention Centre was still reliant on a pencil and diary system and the Arena was using the Events Perfect (EP) software which was coming to end of life.

We could see that it would be quicker and more efficient, more dynamic and would reduce training levels.\u00a0 The fact that we would also be able to integrate with other systems such as finance was also important. It was critical that our auditors felt that it was secure and our IT department assured them of that. The transition to the new solution went smoothly and Priava took care of migrating over all our data from our last financial year.

For example for Table Tennis we may have three different sessions daily and then at the other end of the scale we have more comprehensive and detailed annual events such as \u2018The Home Show\u2019, or \u2018The Super 15 Tournament\u2019, all of which can require extensive planning and logistics.

Before moving to Priava this was quite complicated and might take a whole day, but now I can simply press a button and the information I need is created automatically. The depth of the intelligence is also incredibly valuable both for myself and also to the Council who can be kept up to date with data such as advance bookings, comparisons of occupancy from one year to the next and the split of how venues are used.\u00a0 For example we can analyse what volume of bookings are for \u2018national sports\u2019 \u2018community\u2019, \u2018conferences\u2019 and also whether facilities are being used by underprivileged members of the community.

This means we can now engage with more prospects, spend more time building relationships with existing clients and revisit older clients for potential re-bookings. The return on investment has been phenomenal; I believe the system has paid for itself already\u201d.", "The events team manages around 1,000 bookings per year and this number is increasing month by month. It is therefore of paramount importance that the quality of service and professionalism is maintained for each individual booking. Eloise explains, \u201cWe have set very high standard for our conferencing events and booking process. To support this ethos we make \u20185 simple promises\u2019 to all our customers that ensures they receive an excellent service, with guarantees on pricing and availability. Priava Cloud supports this perfectly as it allows us to create an audit trail of the complete booking from initial phone call to the time they arrive at the facility. It eliminates double bookings, and it automatically devolves the supporting activities, such as catering, to the relevant department.\u201d", "She continues, \u201cIn the past we used a paper-based system for this activity and often it created complete chaos, but now everyone understands their responsibilities and therefore we can be confident our bookings are delivered as promised. \u201c", "Another aspect that has helped increased bookings is the ability to track all of the quotes, manage potential prospects, revisit older clients, and gain valuable business intelligence on existing customers. Eloise explains, \u201cUsing this solution I can create a professional sales pipeline building tool using the customised reporting. For example, I now know who our most lucrative clients are, which ones book the most often, where we obtain the highest margin and so forth.

As a former user of Events Perfect in the past, I was familiar and comfortable with Priava as a company, but in particular it was the ease of use of the system which convinced us they would be the best choice.

As one of the first theatrical performance venues in NZ to use the software, and with a brand new venue, the ITR wanted to be on the cusp of engaging the most innovative technology available and felt that it could support the team to manage a higher number of bookings and at the same time deliver an exceptional service to our clients, from touring companies through to corporates or members of the public.\u201d", "Once Priava was selected the team began to migrate all the necessary spreadsheets and word documents on to the new system including all the bookings for 2015, 2016 and beyond.\u00a0 The original 4 (and now 8-strong) events management team were given some basic face-to-face training on the core functionality such as managing the calendaring and setting up events sheets.", "\u201cThe training was really good and we liked the fact that Priava pre-tailored those sessions towards theatres and demonstrated how the system would work with a real life show or event, putting it more into context\u201d says Freya, \u201cMembers of the team that had been with the theatre prior to the rebuild and were used to the old methods, found the system really intuitive and easy to pick up, so everyone got on board quickly. As many of the ITR team have multiple roles we need to maximise our resources and have the ability to switch easily from one activity to another, something that Priava allows us to do effortlessly. With the reduction in administration it saves us a significant amount of time. And as the old adage says \u2018Time is money\u2019, so we are more financially effective and resourceful as well\u201d", "According to Freya all the staff agree that the system really caters to the particular needs of the theatre. \u201cWe used to run an \u2018industry-mode\u2019 pencil system to handle bookings where we would have \u2018first pencil\u2019 and \u2018second pencil\u2019 etc, but this now seems redundant with Priava and we\u2019ve been able to introduce a much more practical solution of Expressions of Interest with colour coding to determine a final confirmation. We recognised early on that Priava is a very sophisticated system with plenty of functionality, but at the same time we find it simple to use.\u201d", "The introduction of Priava has transformed how the theatre books and manages its events. \u201cThe events sheet is brilliant\u201d says Freya, \u201cWe have all the information we need in one place, showing us a rundown of what\u2019s happening and we simply click a button and we can email a report to everyone involved. The whole team has real-time access to up-to-date information from any location and they can see at a glance what is going on across all the spaces in the theatre from the grand circle foyer right through to main stage. So whether it is a performance, a small fringe theatre production, a corporate function, wedding, party or gig, everything is recorded in one system.\u201d", "\u201cWith everyone being fully informed, this makes our internal communications much stronger as the team is now acting collectively and because we know who has logged which events, we can eliminate the possibility of double bookings and have more accountability over who is responsible for what. Tasks can easily be assigned and you can see clearly what you have left to do on any event at any one time.\u201d", "With less time spent on administration the new system frees up more time to nurture client relationships. Freya explains, \u201cWhether we are talking with promoters, corporates or members of the public, the service they receive starts before they walk in the door. As an example, for touring companies that are booking dates across the whole country, we can see clearly on Priava what spaces or dates are available and then make the necessary provisional or confirmed bookings.", "This makes life easier both for us and prospective clients. The feedback from performance teams when they arrive is that they feel they already know us, so they are simply left to enjoy what they enjoy doing. With access to all the necessary information such as technical details, venue inventory, hospitality, timings, merchandising and what\u2019s on the artist and crew rider, we can always be one step ahead, so clients are assured we have already attended to everything.\u201d", "In 2016, the theatre was recognised by the Champion Canterbury Business Awards 2016 winning \u2018Retail/Hospitality Small Enterprise\u2019 Supreme Award for \u2018dynamic professionals providing a phenomenal customer experience\u2019 and also took the \u2018Supreme Venue of the Year\u2019 at the 2016 Entertainment Venues Association of New Zealand (EVANZ) Awards.", "The fact that Priava is cloud-based means that the management users can access the system when they are not in the office, or travelling overseas. \u201cYou don\u2019t realise how reliant you are on instant access to data, and Priava fully supports this need\u201d adds Freya.", "The system also helps us to give additional hand-holding for those that may not have had experience of events too, with the function sheet acting as checklist for all parties. So if the venue is staging a wedding or corporate function they can share the timetable of the event with the bride and groom/ CEO and if necessary make any last-minute tweaks, such as when the speeches take place.", "Freya says, \u201cWith Priava you follow a clearly defined and structured process, from logging an initial interest or opportunity through to a slick delivery of the event itself.\u00a0 The team has the resources to work together, as well as autonomously, as they have everything they need to run their own event.\u201d", "Now that the re-built theatre has been open for over 2 years, it can begin to measure how the venue\u2019s occupancy and events bookings have grown and build up historical data that can be used to encourage repeat bookings. As Freya explains, \u201cWe are privileged in that we are the only theatre venue of this size in the area so we find that much of our business comes to us. But as more venues open in the city the biggest challenge is to ensure we make best use of the timeslots and spaces we have available so we can sell any spare days. Whilst we can\u2019t alter what is on stage, we have found that by using Priava the system can identify spaces that have spare capacity.\u201d", "The theatre\u2019s overall number of performance days has almost doubled from 180 prior to the re-opening up to 320 in 2016. With the aid of Priava\u2019s built-in reporting module, the theatre can easily pinpoint what spaces are being booked and also identify those that are under-utilised.", "Making the most of \u2018dark days\u2019", "With better scrutiny and analysis of when the theatre\u2019s different facilities are free, it has been possible to spot new opportunities. Freya says, \u201cWe\u2019ve realised that we have more opportunities than we realised, especially if we think creatively. For example, during \u2018dark days\u2019 when the cast is having a rest period or on \u2018pack-in/out days\u2019 when the stage is being prepared or the show is being dismantled, these days still represent opportunities for hiring out spaces, either in front of the curtain or in other adjoining areas.\u00a0 So with the theatre curtain pulled down there is still the ability to hire out the space for say a business seminar, public tours or even school workshops, which allows us to engage our community as well.\u201d", "Extra income from booking advertising space", "With more visibility of spare capacity, not only is the theatre able to optimise and maximise use of their venue spaces more effectively, they are also using Priava to boost the revenue from its advertising vehicles such as window display spaces and poster boxes. \u201cUsing Priava\u2019s unique functionality we can also maximise additional income from spaces for promotion, so a touring company might want to reserve a decal for the front of the theatre for a number of weeks. So essentially we use Priava to book this, quote this and can store all the associated details such as imagery, costs, mark-ups and so on. And then ultimately bill it\u2026!\u201d", "Detailed analysis aids planning", "The reporting capabilities of Priava are also used to produce in-depth analysis for senior management so they can review the type of clients and where business is coming from. \u201cWe use Priava for overall business intelligence as well as specifics. For instance, we have a flexible fringe theatre space that is linked with sponsorship for local community groups, so we can see which performances are successful, who attended and which ones are subsidised with grants from the sponsorship. We can also report on what technical equipment is being hired for different spaces.", "All this information is essential towards the future planning, investment and overall strategy for the theatre.\u201d The theatre also uses reporting to measure how third party contractors have helped to refer business, the number of enquiries that have completed and the number that have cancelled.", "\u00a0", "Spotlight on the future \u2013 Being more proactive and integration with Xero", "With the help of Priava, the theatre has linked its online enquiries with the \u2018opportunities tab\u2019 within the system, so in the future the team will closely analyse those that didn\u2019t go on to confirm and will contact them to see what happened. The theatre also plans to become more proactive too, by looking at other trends such as Christmas party and school holiday bookings and making contact with those companies and organisations that perhaps had made an enquiry previously.", "The theatre is also excited about taking advantage of the planned integration between Priava and their accounting solution, Xero. Freya says, \u201cThe integration will be fantastic as it will link all the specific event invoices up and make it even easier for the team to split between performance and non-performance revenue streams.\u201d", "\u00a0", "The benefits that the Isaac Theatre Royal has achieved through the use of the Priava cloud-based venue management solution so far include:", "\u201cThe customer support from Priava has been excellent and we are always made to feel that we are a valued client and all our comments and input are being listened to. It\u2019s great to know that there is community of fellow venues out there that are all helping to develop the product.

Customer Services Manager at GPAC, Tina Rettke explains \u201cPerhaps this decision would have been slightly more scary if we hadn\u2019t used cloud-based applications before and this was our first attempt, however, given that we were already using cloud-based systems for our ticketing and rosters, we knew what to expect.\u201d Tina expounds that the primary factor in their decision making process was the speed of the system, \u201cThis was mainly because we had previously implemented another cloud-based system to manage another area of our business and it just wasn\u2019t very quick, so we needed to make sure that any new system that we chose would be fast enough for what we needed.\u201d", "In the end it was decided that Priava was the most sensible choice as they had an existing relationship with the Priava team, which would translate into a smooth implementation process. Tina Rettke comments \u201cWhile we had a brief look into other providers on the market, at the time we made the decision to move to Priava because we already had an existing relationship with their support team and they understand how we work.\u201d Since implementing Priava in January 2016, Tina affirms that the system has delivered the speed that they needed from a cloud-based application,\u00a0 \u201cSince we started using the system, we have been happy with the reliability and speed delivered by Priava. As long as the Internet connection is stable, then you can access the most up-to-date version of the system.\u201d", "\"With Priava, all updates are done outside of business hours, so our users just come into work the next day and get started using the latest version of the Priava \u2013 there\u2019s nothing else that needs to be done.\"", "Tina Rettke", "Customer Services Manager", "Geelong Performing Arts Centre", "One of the most immediate benefits experienced by GPAC following the implementation of Priava\u2019s cloud-based system is that all updates are administered remotely. This means that users no longer have to rely on IT departments to install updates on local servers and computers. This not only reduces outages and other issues resulting from delayed or incomplete system updates, but it also saves a substantial amount of time. Tina affirms the impact of this benefit based on her first-hand experience, \u201cI was the person who was responsible for administering all of the system updates so this benefit alone has had a significant impact on me personally as it has saved me hours of time. Furthermore, it has saved time for our users who no longer have to wait for system updates and they do not impact on their ability to access the system during business hours. With Priava, all updates are done outside of business hours, so our users just come into work the next day and get started using the latest version of the Priava \u2013 there\u2019s nothing else that needs to be done.\u201d", "Another benefit that the team at GPAC experienced instantaneously was the increased accessibility of the system compared with that of an on-premise solution. \u00a0Using Priava, the GPAC team have been afforded the flexibility to work away from their desk \u2013 even from home. Tina explains, \u201cI love that being cloud-based, I can access the system from home using my iPad. It just makes things so much easier, because if I need to check something quickly then I can do it away from my desk.\u201d", "With such a large volume of events being hosted across multiple venues each month, GPAC require a system that is both intuitive and efficient. Venue Operations Coordinator at GPAC, Angelique Helman, is largely responsible for coordinating all of the events hosted within the venue and has found a number of features within Priava that deliver significant time-saving benefits. Angelique explains, \u201cI really like working with the chart. It is so easy to look at, which means I can quickly check availability, get a snapshot of our upcoming bookings and add new bookings.\u201d Angelique also believes that the actions tab is another great time saving feature. She explains, \u201cThe actions tab is very handy because it means I can produce reports or invoices from within the relevant event record.\u201c", "Above and beyond all, Angelique loves that she can work across multiple tabs while using the system, \u201cUsing Priava I am able to have multiple tabs open, so that I can work on a number of things at the same time which is something our previous system couldn\u2019t do. I find this particularly helpful, because if I am working on one event and need to quickly open another event record \u2013 for example if a client calls, or another staff member has a query \u2013 then I can simply open another tab without having to close the event that I was already working on. This not only saves time in closing and reopening event records, it also limits the interruptions to my work \u2013 I can simply navigate back to the other tab and continue working where I left off.\u201d", "Despite having 15 users licenses, only 4 users participated in the initial training sessions. These same users were then able to share what they had learnt in order to train the rest of the team. Tina comments, \u201cWe haven\u2019t required any additional training since the initial implementation. Only four of our users were in attendance at the initial training sessions and we were then able to train the other staff in the venue. For example, our front of house department, our box office department, stage door, cleaners and the technicians have been trained by members of our team and have found Priava very easy to use.\u201d", "As part of a subscription to Priava\u2019s Core Software & CRM module, users have access to more than 35 standard report templates which can be used to extract critical information about things like venue occupancy, details about upcoming bookings and outstanding enquiries, and can also be used to produce invoices and booking contracts. Venue Operations Coordinator at GPAC, Angela Blackney, explains the impact that these core reports have had on her ability to access key data, \u201cUsing Priava\u2019s report feature, we can get more out of the system than we could with our previous system. It is intuitive and easy-to-use and we can personalise templates with our own logos etc. and create customised filters to restrict any unnecessary data from appearing on reports. Furthermore, we can also create completely tailored reports based on the existing templates.\u201d", "Subscription basis means you only pay for what you need", "As Priava is offered on a subscription basis, clients have the ability to pick and choose which parts of the system that they subscribe to, based on their business needs. Tina affirms that the subscription model has already benefitted GPAC, \u201cAt the time we implemented Priava we were only subscribed to the Core System & CRM, Events & Bookings, Inventory, Packages and Advanced Permissions, however, since using the system we have realised the need for Catering so we were able to increase our subscription to include the additional module which we will begin using later this year.\u201d", "The benefits that GPAC has achieved through the use of Priava\u2019s cloud-based performing arts center software\u00a0solution so far include:", "Having made the decision to move to multiple cloud-based applications to manage various aspect of their business, GPAC chose to keep their local server in the short term to enable them to access read only versions of their former on-premise solutions as a reference point. That said, the management team believe that there will come to a point that this data is no longer required at which point they will be able to retire their servers and operate completely on the cloud. Tina explains, \u201cCurrently, we still need to go back and refer to the data within our former event and venue management system, so we have a read only database stored on our existing server. This is the same for each of the different cloud-based applications that we have adopted across our business. This means that at present we still have to maintain and back up our existing servers. That said, we expect that in future as the historic data from our older, on-premise systems becomes out-dates and irrelevant we will no longer need to maintain those servers and this will have a significant impact not only on our dependence on IT resources, but will also have considerable financial impact.\u201d", "\u00a0", "Download a PDF of this case study", "\u00a0", "Sign up to our email updates", "Get venue and event management news in your inbox", "Venue and event management in the cloud", "Formed in 2013, ", "Fabulous Fan Fayre", " (F3) is a joint venture between ", "One Event Management Ltd", " and ", "Legends Hospitality", " that is designed to offer guests a new, unique, and truly memorable experience.

IT Manager at F3, Sean Marshall explains why they finally chose Priava, \u201cThe other solutions were much more complex to use, and did not give the flexibility we needed in the reporting and the venue management. The Priava solution on the other hand was much more organised and structured giving us a better understanding of how it could impact our business and was cost-effective.\u201d", "According to F3 the implementation went very smoothly. After Priava had customised the solution to meet F3\u2019s needs they then initiated a training for the six users at MCFC.\u00a0 They have since taken advantage of Priava\u2019s Advanced Permissions Module for another stadium, that effectively enables additional users to be added to the main system with controlled access to information that is only relevant to that venue.\u00a0 The benefit of this is that F3 need only invest in one system and simply add on additional users as they grow their business with additional venues.\u00a0 Rebecca comments, \u201cThe training went very well, from a user point of view the system is very straight forward, self-explanatory, easy to use and intuitive and compared really favourably with other systems I had used in the past.\u201d", "\u201cWhat we really liked\u201d, said Rebecca, \u201cis that we could make it venue specific and customise the reports accordingly producing the data that we wanted \u2013 something that was more difficult to do with other systems.\u201d", "She continues, \u201cThis is very important as we can produce weekly reports from the system, log every enquiry, view conversion levels, etc. that we then share with the board of directors and senior management. Essentially it provides a \u2018snap-shot\u2019 of the business from how many bookings we have made, lost bookings, reasons why we lost a booking, active enquiries, and so on. We can then do a comparison on either a month on month basis or with a similar period such as Christmas. This enables us to investigate how we can do things better and what elements we need to focus on to develop our key revenue earners.\u201d", "Part of this process is producing a \u2018Top-Ten\u2019 report that lists which clients are performing the best in terms of biggest spenders, and it allows F3 to compare this month-by-month and make comparisons.\u00a0 Rebecca explains why this is important, \u201cUsing Priava\u2019s customised reporting we can break-down the data on any metric that we require, for example we can track conversion levels, monitor every enquiry and so on. What we can clearly see from the top ten report, are reductions in spend, so we can then investigate why this might be. Of course it could be nothing to do with the venue, simply they just don\u2019t have any events planned for that period, however if there is a problem we are in a position to proactively resolve it.\u201d", "One way in which F3 keeps in touch with loyal clients is to invite them to \u2018Thank You\u2019 events. Rebecca explains, \u201cPriava is excellent at managing customer relations.\u00a0 We can attach our key contacts against multiple organisations, which allows us to treat each individual as a person rather than merely a corporate contact, as they may move positions or may even book an event for private use. With Priava we can create a report of contacts for an email campaign to attend a thank you event or perhaps send over a special offer.\u201d\u00a0 In parallel, Priava provides a full-blown CRM solution for the sales team so they can encourage repeat business from existing clients and chase up new opportunities.\u00a0", "\u201cNot only does Priava support the day to day activities of the sales team but it also helps to incentivise them too\u201d says Rebecca. \u201cThe reporting within Priava provides complete transparency on overall and individual performance, so for example we can celebrate the \u2018booking of the week\u2019 or motivate staff when they reach targets or have healthy projected bookings\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "Once bookings are confirmed Priava provides some key functionality that helps save time for staff and maximise revenues. Two such features include \u2018Packages\u2019 and \u2018Master & Sub-Events\u2019 that can be applied to larger events or promotions. One such example at M.C.F.C was to set up a \u2018Mother\u2019s Day package\u2019. Once set up it makes life very easy for the event coordinators as they can simply add the data for each new booking and the system does the rest. Rebecca explains, \u201cAll menus are configured so that all data such as pricing is just entered once and we can call on it when we need it. It\u2019s brilliant because it allows the team to spend more time talking to prospects and clients and as they don\u2019t have to create a new template each time, it saves lots of effort, introduces consistency and reduces errors.", "The Master & Sub Events feature means you have a single function sheet that breaks down the revenue to individual bookings or clients rather than lumps it into one big event. For example on the last Mother\u2019s Day we had 20 bookings as sub-events, for 95 people for a package that included; a carvery, tea and coffee, room hire element, and complimentary chocolates. We were then able to identify who was buying what and to charge them accordingly.\u201d", "Day to day efficiencies through easy navigation, automation, multiple tabs and bookings chart", "According to Rebecca the ease of use of the system makes life easy for the team to manage day to day operations. \u201cIn particular\u201d says Rebecca, \u201cThe multiple tabs list is really great when you are working on an event and then receive a call. Rather than closing down what you are working on, you can simply open up another tab.\u201d", "One of the biggest challenges for managing venues at stadia is uncertainty in terms of what fixtures are coming up. In M.C.F.C\u2019s case, match days can be changed sometimes at a moment\u2019s notice but with Priava\u2019s Chart feature it\u2019s easy to see what\u2019s confirmed or the bookings secured against certain dates. In parallel it is impossible to double-book events, because the system will flag up any clashes when bookings are changed and it also manages all the inventory that is available within the venue such as furniture, projectors, and puts quantity restrictions on certain items. According to Rebecca this is perfect for stadiums where you have multiple team members taking bookings within different wings of the same facility at the same time. The new \u2018Tasks\u2019 upgrade that attaches user specific \u2018Tasks\u2019 to bookings, means that notes can be added and activities can be assigned to different team members.", "\u201cWe know what our figures are before accounts do\u201d", "According to Rebecca one important aspect of managing the venues is having financial figures readily available as soon as possible. \u201cWith Priava we can record all revenues so there is no need to wait for the accounts department to produce the reports, we can look at what we\u2019ve done at the end of the month immediately. We know what our figures are before accounts do.\u201d", "Bookings up by 44%", "Since the installation of the Priava solution the F3 events business has seen a significant increase in the number of bookings taken, due to a number of factors, such as the quality of the venue and catering, the hospitality team as a whole and the underlying technology.

Everyone had a positive reaction to the software. I was a little afraid of moving to a new solution as we were very busy but the experience was absolutely fine. The training was brilliant, delivered with the patience of an angel, and gave us all we needed to know. As we are a small team with no IT manager, being in the cloud is significant as we save on IT management costs and it is one less thing to worry about. Everyone can also take advantage of being able to work from home now too.\u201d\u00a0 The venue has four users altogether including members of the events, sales and management teams.", "\u201cFrom the outset\u201d says Paulina, \u201cwe could see it had the functionality of our old system but was 100% easier and faster to use than our previous system. In particular adding in new contacts, dates and events used to take a long time, but with Priava it takes a couple of seconds \u2013 it\u2019s magical!\u00a0 Everyone was really impressed by the new system, it was really easy to manoeuvre through the various sections compared with what we had before. It also looks so much clearer on the screen and for every action there are less key strokes involved and we can retrieve information much faster than before.\u201d", "\u201cEverything we need to know we can get from the reports\u201d", "With the new system\u2019s reporting capabilities it is now possible to use information stored in the system to help both the sales and management departments gain insight on the venue such as identifying trends or types of bookings.\u00a0 Paulina explains, \u201cWe have a lot of different departments including operations, kitchen, managers and so on, that all require different data on various parts of the venue and event management. Using Priava it is very simple to run reports on whatever is needed, for example we can look at all the business which has been lost during a specific period and analyse the reasons such as, \u2018no availability\u2019, \u2018price\u2019 and so on.", "The reports have also enabled us to present more accurate sales forecasting to the senior management team. We had some initial support on setting up the first few reports, but now we are completely self-sufficient and can set up a report for pretty much any metric. Everything we need to know we can get from the reports and all the recipients find them valuable and easy to read. If I receive a request from our sales director on the number of enquiries we won or lost last month I can produce it instantly.\u201d The venue can also look at where revenues are coming from and what proportion comes from where such as \u2018Hire\u2019, \u2018Catering\u2019 or \u2018Extras\u2019.", "Managing opportunities and follow-ups is effortless", "The intelligence created by the reports can help the day to day sales operation by providing key information such as \u2018top bookers\u2019 or reasons why a booking is made or not, such as \u2018too expensive\u2019 or \u2018don\u2019t have data available\u2019. \u201cWith more information about our customers, we are more prepared when making a sales call as we know more about them.\u201d Says Paulina. By drawing on past records such as who booked last year, the venue can also easily print out contacts for the business development team to follow up for the coming year. According to Paulina, managing opportunities on a daily basis is effortless because there is no duplication involved. \u201cWe put in all opportunities in the calendar as provisional, so we can see what chase-ups we need to do, without having to log this on a separate spreadsheet \u2013 everything is on the system.\u201d", "Easy to produce event sheets act as \u201cblueprint for success\u201d", "Not only does Priava support the optimisation of booking sales Paulina explains how it facilitates the management and delivery of events, \u201cWe really like the event sheets, as they provide a \u2018blueprint\u2019 for success. Once created they are given out to everyone involved such as the operations team, serving staff and the event managers. Adding new clients is very easy and the event sheets are clear and easy to understand. This was very time-consuming using the previous system. You don\u2019t have to be a \u2018techy\u2019 person to use it, you instinctively know where to go.

The coloured Tasks tab is great as it acts as an aide-memoire for all essential actions such as client call-backs, checking wine or food requirements, confirming running order, following up on enquiries and so forth\u201d.", "Remote Access from any location provides better client collaboration", "As the Priava solution is cloud-based, it can be accessed from any device that has a web-browser and Internet connection. According to Paulina this is very useful as it means that they can always respond quickly when a booking request comes in and they can access client and other data, real-time in meetings rooms and other places when they are away from their usual workplace. \u201cBy capturing an enquiry and checking availability there and then, reduces the risk of us losing an opportunity.\u201d", "\u00a0", "Since the implementation, the venue has continued to meet its incremental annual targets and has seen further growth in repeat bookings which now represents between 40-45% of its overall business.", "The benefits that Ironmongers\u2019 Hall has achieved through the use of the Priava cloud-based venue management solution so far include:", "Final comment from Paulina", " \u201cThe solution is both reliable and brilliant, it has everything you need, and it does everything we want to do in just a few clicks.

Neighbourhood Facilities Officer at Penrith City Council, David Fowler, explains, \u201cThe initial news about Events Perfect coming to end of life came as a shock to us as we were not looking to make any changes, however, it provided us with an opportunity to look at what other systems were available and consider what would be the best option for us moving forward.\u201d", "According to David, the two major concerns for the council when they were considering new systems were downtime and data. \u201cTime was a primary factor for us and we wanted to be sure that whatever option we chose would not cause any disruptions for our team while the new system was being implemented\u201d says David, \u201cAnother thing we were concerned about were the risks associated with moving data over to a new system. In the end, it was decided that the best option was Priava, they understood how we worked. In addition, they provided a clear plan for how they could migrate our existing data over to the new system which gave us peace of mind knowing that there wouldn\u2019t be any issues.\u201d", "\"You can open multiple tabs and work on multiple things simultaneously. For example, you can run reports, while processing payments in other parts of the system. This means that you can maximise your efficiency and create your own production line of tasks, which is a huge benefit for our staff.\"", "David Fowler", "Neighbourhood Facilities Officer", "Penrith City Council", "Following a successful migration of their existing data and two training sessions, Penrith City Council went live with Priava in June 2015. David comments, \u201cIt was all done relatively quickly and painlessly. Everyone responded well to the training sessions. The system is so intuitive and the whole process didn\u2019t take long.\u201d He continues, \u201cOne day we were using our old system and the next day we were with Priava.\u201d", "One of the primary benefits of Priava and the reason that it is so easy-to-use, is that it was built based on the experience that had been gained by providing venue and event management solutions to a wide range of clients across the globe for more than 15 years. This meant that the developers could draw on a wealth of client feedback along with tried and tested processes. One of the biggest improvements was the move from an on-premise solution, to a system based in the cloud. This made the new system much more scalable and futureproof \u2013 perfect for a thriving council.", "Priava was one of the first cloud-based solutions to be implemented at the council. Following its successful implementation, the council has adopted a number of other cloud-based systems to support various parts of their operations. David explains, \u201cIt was a learning curve for us because the organisation hadn\u2019t had much experienced with a cloud-based system before. In the time since implementing Priava however we have seen most of our systems move to the cloud in a really short space of time.\u201d He continues, \u201cPriava was a bit of a testing ground for the cloud.\u201d", "Reduced dependence on in-house IT Support and no need for on-site servers", "One of the key differences of true cloud-based, multi-tenant systems versus on-premise solutions, is that all users have access to the same version of the system because all updates are installed remotely by the software developers. For Penrith City Council, this benefit alone has had a huge impact on their operation, because it has significantly reduced their dependence on their internal IT resources. David explains, \u201cIT doesn\u2019t really need to know what Priava is anymore because all updates are installed remotely and all of our support requests are addressed by Priava\u2019s support team.\u201d", "On top of the time savings Penrith City Council has experienced, they have also significantly reduced their IT infrastructure costs as they no longer need a server to store all of their data. By eliminating the need for a server, they have considerably reduced their dependence on internal IT support that would have previously been invested in maintaining their server and administering system updates. These savings can then be reinvested into other areas of their organisation which will in turn result in a better experience for the Penrith community.", "Ability to multi-task", "With more than 45,000 venue bookings per year, efficiency is the key to enabling the staff at Penrith City Council to manage their venue bookings effectively. One of the primary features of Priava is the ability to multi-task. Users can work across multiple tabs and can add, edit and delete information from various contact and organisation records, opportunities and event bookings and produce reports at the same time. David elaborates, \u201cYou can open multiple tabs and work on multiple things simultaneously. For example, you can run reports, while processing payments in other parts of the system. This means that you can maximise your efficiency and create your own production line of tasks, which is a huge benefit for our staff.\u201d", "Advanced reporting capabilities", "David believes that one of the most impressive parts of the system is the reporting feature. Priava\u2019s core system includes a suite of more than 35 report templates that can be tailored by system administrators to determine what information is displayed on reports and how it appears. He explains, \u201cReporting is definitely more sophisticated than it was in our old system. From what I have experienced, there\u2019s a huge scope of information that we can get out of Priava. We have really benefited from working with the Priava support team to understand what each of the reports are and how we can use them to access key information.\u201d", "Advanced Bulk Edit streamlines the process of managing repeat and reoccurring bookings", "The Bulk Edit feature is perhaps the single most important piece of functionality for the team at Penrith City Council. Due to the sheer volume of repeat and reoccurring events and venue bookings that they manage, this feature provides significant time savings as it allows them to make changes to multiple event records simultaneously. Bulk Edit was in its early stages of development at the time that Penrith City Council began using Priava, however, during the time they have been using the system there have been multiple updates to this feature including the introduction of \u201c", "Advanced Bulk Edit", "\u201d and all of these updates have been included free of charge as part of their subscription to the Events and Bookings module.", "David explains, \u201cUsing Bulk Edit you can pick and choose which event details and charges you would like to update so you can make changes in isolation or completely change the details of a group of events that you have selected.\u201d He continues, \u201cAnother benefit is that you can now edit the contact that is associated with multiple events which you couldn\u2019t do in our old system, but all of this is achieved quickly and easily using Priava\u2019s Bulk Edit feature.\u201d", "Easy-to-use system reduces time invested in training new staff", "For large-scale organisations like Penrith City Council, it is important to minimise the time and resources required to induct new staff members as this can have a significant impact on productivity levels. Implementing technologies that are intuitive and easy-to-use means less training for new staff and in turn, this minimises the impact or any downtime experienced by the organisation when a new staff member joins the team. David explains that Priava requires little training for new users. \u201cWhen new staff come on board, you really only need to show them through the basics of the system once.\u201d He continues, \u201cThis has translated into time savings for our organisation. People find it easy to pick up and use which means I can spend less time training new staff and reinvest that time back into other areas.\u201d", "One system can serve multiple venues across various departments simultaneously", "Penrith City Council have implemented Priava for two separate departments across their organisation. David explains, \u201cIn our department the Neighbourhood Facilities Team manage approximately 40 neighbourhood centres, community centres and halls, and the Recreation Team manage approximately 150 sporting fields and complexes. In addition, our Children\u2019s Services Department also use Priava to manage their Child & Family Precinct.\u201d He continues, \u201cBeing able to work from the same system improves communication between departments and teams. It also means that we can work together to support one another as we can draw on our shared experiences to get the most out of the system.\u201d", "Increase efficiency by capturing enquiries online", "Penrith City Council has recently implemented Online Calendar & Enquiries to assist them in capturing enquiries for their neighbourhood facilities. This allows visitors to their website to check availability online before submitting a venue hire enquiry. All enquiries submitted via the online form are populated into Priava ready for the team to pick up straight away which has further streamlined the booking process. With the introduction of Online Bookings which enables customers to pay online at the time of making their booking, David and the team are keen to explore the increased efficiency and service this module can add.", "Plans to integrate in future", "Penrith City Council is always looking for ways to improve productivity, and looks forward to working with Priava on future integration with some of their corporate systems.", "The benefits that Penrith City Council has achieved through the use of the Priava cloud-based venue management solution so far include:", "\u201cIt\u2019s just so intuitive.
