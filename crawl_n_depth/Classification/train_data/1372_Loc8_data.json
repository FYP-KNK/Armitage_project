This will help technicians resolve cases on their first visit, eliminating the need for another engineer to assist him on-site. Such tools can also provide a centralised base of knowledge content, such as repair video tutorial, how-to guides, and service request history.

This results in a larger gap in the technician\u2019s schedule. In fact, most field service companies will receive more cancellations than urgent requests, which means you can overbook your technicians without facing too much of a problem.
