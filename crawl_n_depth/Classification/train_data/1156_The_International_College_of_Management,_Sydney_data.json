We were really lucky with the friends we made. Most of them didn\u2019t go to uni with us, but we met them through living in the city and going to different local events. Many of them had moved to San Francisco from interstate, and took us to their family\u2019s places over weekends. Going to Newport Beach was one of our favourite moments of the trip, it was just a weekend of constant happiness. We were taken to local parties, rode our bikes all day and night, spent days on our friends\u2019 boats and went hiking around Laguna Beach. We are still friends with some of these guys and are convincing them to come down under.", "2. Going to Berkley for St Patrick\u2019s Day. This was our first experience of the frat and sorority life. Picture a street of about 20 huge houses, with Greek symbols out the front of each one \u2013 it was exactly like being in a movie. We spent the day on the rooftop of one of the frat mansions, followed by dinner and \u2018a recoop\u2019 before heading to the Berkley swimming pool, jumping in fully clothed and then covering the locker room floor in soap and sliding around the lockers and showers with a bunch of our friends. The parties then continued at various places along the street. It was one of the most American experiences we could ever have been a part of.", "3. At the end of the semester we hired a campervan and began our month long road trip of America. This was one of the coolest experiences of our lives, we had absolutely no plan except an end date and final destination. We slept wherever we would end up each night, and would drive to the next beach or destination after reading local guides, searching Instagram and asking Americans where they recommend. We spent nights in the middle of the desert with no reception, water, or signs of civilisation and then, two days later, we would be walking along the main strip of Las Vegas.", "Oh and we have to add one more - being on the Ellen DeGeneres Show! We were selected to be part of a competition, and spent the afternoon running around a fitness store looking for items to win prizes.", "We were members of the Study Abroad group, which had weekly meetups and events that were optional and pretty fun. We didn\u2019t commit to weekly activities so we could keep our schedules as open as possible to have the freedom to take mini trips throughout the term.", "We lived off campus actually. We found a place on Airbnb and it turned out to be the best decision ever. We were based one street back from Ocean Beach, in the middle of a great neighbourhood, among all of the friends we made in San Francisco, and surrounded by some of the best cafe and bars in the area. Living on campus in San Francisco isn\u2019t very popular, unless you are under the age of 18 and in your first term of university. Most people live with friends.", "If you\u2019re confident to go by yourself, do it. For us, having someone else to enjoy the experience with made the trip so much better. Knowing there is always someone there you can relate to from home made a huge difference. Having someone to laugh with when everything wasn\u2019t quite going to plan is a bonus. We had a few situations where we wanted to cry, scream or hide but instead we would just look at each other and laugh. But also, draw up the pros and cons of your options. We did a lot of research into the universities on offer to us, and San Francisco suited us best in terms of lifestyle, and the experiences we want to get out of exchange. It is a once in a life time opportunity so just do it.", "Jess M: I\u2019m in my last trimester at ICMS now, and since returning have been working a lot, in part to pay off the trip, but also with the intention of saving up for the next trip, wherever that may be. But once I finish in December, I\u2019ll begin the adventures of finding full time work, and being a college graduate.", "Jess G: Upon return I completed my degree, and am now working full time at Warringah Council in the events department.", "Click ", "here", " for more information about our exchange programs.", "Air Jordan II 2 Shoes", "[email\u00a0protected]", "\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a9 Copyright 2020 ICMS", "International College of Management, Sydney Pty Ltd ACN 003 144 045 ATF The ICTHM Trust ABN 54 174 259 919, trading as International College of Management, Sydney and Aspire Institute, Aspire English, International Sport College of Australia CRICOS Provider Code: 01484M, RTO Code: 90851, TEQSA ID: PRV12025", "Complete the form below to accept your offer.", "\"I felt that by studying at ICMS, I could have a much better work/study life balance.\"", "\"I started my current role through ICMS industry training.\"", "\"The Industry Training Program is a real highlight of ICMS.\"", "\"The international focus at ICMS has allowed me to broaden my perspective.\"", "\"ICMS provides amazing opportunities for learning, networking and industry experience.\"", "[email\u00a0protected]", "\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a9 Copyright 2020 ICMS", "International College of Management, Sydney Pty Ltd ACN 003 144 045 ATF The ICTHM Trust ABN 54 174 259 919, trading as International College of Management, Sydney and Aspire Institute, Aspire English, International Sport College of Australia CRICOS Provider Code: 01484M, RTO Code: 90851, TEQSA ID: PRV12025", "\"I felt that by studying at ICMS, I could have a much better work/study life balance.\"", "\"I felt that by studying at ICMS, I could have a much better work/study life balance.\"", "\"I started my current role through ICMS industry training.\"", "\"The Industry Training Program is a real highlight of ICMS.\"", "\"The international focus at ICMS has allowed me to broaden my perspective.\"", "\"ICMS provides amazing opportunities for learning, networking and industry experience.\"", "[email\u00a0protected]", "\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a9 Copyright 2020 ICMS", "International College of Management, Sydney Pty Ltd ACN 003 144 045 ATF The ICTHM Trust ABN 54 174 259 919, trading as International College of Management, Sydney and Aspire Institute, Aspire English, International Sport College of Australia CRICOS Provider Code: 01484M, RTO Code: 90851, TEQSA ID: PRV12025", "\"I started my current role through ICMS industry training.\"", "\"I felt that by studying at ICMS, I could have a much better work/study life balance.\"", "\"I started my current role through ICMS industry training.\"", "\"The Industry Training Program is a real highlight of ICMS.\"", "\"The international focus at ICMS has allowed me to broaden my perspective.\"", "\"ICMS provides amazing opportunities for learning, networking and industry experience.\"", "[email\u00a0protected]", "\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a9 Copyright 2020 ICMS", "International College of Management, Sydney Pty Ltd ACN 003 144 045 ATF The ICTHM Trust ABN 54 174 259 919, trading as International College of Management, Sydney and Aspire Institute, Aspire English, International Sport College of Australia CRICOS Provider Code: 01484M, RTO Code: 90851, TEQSA ID: PRV12025", "[email\u00a0protected]", "\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a9 Copyright 2020 ICMS", "International College of Management, Sydney Pty Ltd ACN 003 144 045 ATF The ICTHM Trust ABN 54 174 259 919, trading as International College of Management, Sydney and Aspire Institute, Aspire English, International Sport College of Australia CRICOS Provider Code: 01484M, RTO Code: 90851, TEQSA ID: PRV12025", "The College's academic committees support the Academic Board in ensuring effective academic governance of the College and assuring academic quality and integrity of the College\u2019s courses through transparent and consistent decision-making.
