These loans are fee-based only, and so they don't have an APR. The establishment fee is 20% of the amount borrowed and the monthly fee is 4% of the amount borrowed. For example, a loan of $1,000 repaid over 3 months equates to a total amount payable of $1,320 comprised of $1,000 principal (amount borrowed), $200 establishment fee and $120 in monthly fees.", "For our Medium Loans between $2,050 and $5,000, the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is 47.6158% (Comparison rate 65.6597% p.a.) and there is a $400 Establishment Fee.
