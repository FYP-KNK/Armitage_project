Treatment with a remodeling helmet usually begins at around 6 months of age and takes around 3-4 months depending on the patients age and severity.\u00a0Due to the precise nature of the scan, a custom fabricated helmet ensures accurate fitting and enables much more symmetrical growth than alternative fabrication methods.", "We are continually finding more and more clinical evidence that supports the positive results of helmet therapy.\u00a0In 2015 Steinberg et al in the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Journal showed that conservative and helmet therapy were both found to be effective in the correction of plagiocephaly. The usage of a helmet\u00a0eliminated the factors that lead to failure in conservative\u00a0management and may be more preferable from the outset. It was also highlighted that any delay in helmeting due to trialing\u00a0conservative treatment does not ruin the chance of future correction as long as the helmet\u00a0therapy is begun during growth stages at around 6-8 months of age.\"", "For more information on the STARband\u00ae range and our clinical services please ", "contact us", ".

Becker Orthopedic now introduces the Triple Action ankle joint. Like the Double Action, the new and innovative component has high stiffness in the coronal and transverse planes and is intended for individuals with neuromuscular pathologies.\u00a0 The increased range of adjustability coupled with an independent alignment feature allows the clinician to optimize biomechanical control of lower-extremity joint segments through all phases of the gait cycle.", "An alignment and fitting protocol has been developed for the Triple Action ankle joint; this will allow clinicians to optimize joint alignment, torque, and range-of-motion settings and by doing so improve clinical outcome and performance. The workshop will provide insight into the biomechanical control features, offer case reviews and a practicum with an assessment AFO with the Triple Action ankle joints.", "\n", "Introduction to Stance Control", "Traditional KAFO\u2019s only lock in full extension, which provides lower limb stability, but also causes patients to ambulate with gait deviations that may lead to other problems over time. Since traditional KAFO\u2019s do not allow for knee flexion while the patient is ambulating, they also require more energy to use. Stance control orthoses (SCO\u2019s) on the other hand, allow the patient\u2019s knee to flex during the swing phase of gait and block flexion in stance phase for stability. An SCO\u2019s ability to provide knee flexion during swing phase allows patients to walk with less effort and a more symmetrical gait patterns.
