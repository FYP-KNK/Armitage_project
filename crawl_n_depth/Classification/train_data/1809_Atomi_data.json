Yet content delivery can often eat up entire lessons, demanding a disproportionate amount of class time. ", "Like many teachers, Jake knew that he had to find more time to dedicate to developing these higher-order skills so that come assessment time, his students didn\u2019t just know the content, but were able to meet the expectations of their markers. This is where Atomi has made a critical difference.", "Since adopting Atomi in his classroom, Jake has been assigning Atomi video lessons and quizzes for homework prior to class.", "For Jake, delivering content more efficiently both in and beyond the classroom has radically changed how his students engage with the subject.", "Beyond improved content knowledge and skills, Jake has noticed a marked improvement in his student\u2019s sense of their own capacity. With traditional models of teaching, if one of Jake's students missed a lesson, or simply wanted to get ahead, there was little opportunity to support them. With Atomi, Jake's students now have a greater opportunity to learn and revise at their own pace. ", "Jake has noticed that for students that may have traditionally been at risk of falling behind, they are now not only keeping up but excelling in all aspects of the class.
