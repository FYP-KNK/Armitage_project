Since your puppy is not able to communicate how they feel, all you really have to go on is changes in their behaviour, which can be tough to pick out. Here are a few tell tale signs that your pup may be feeling less than 100%.", "Puppies need lots of rest \u2014 it\u2019s just a part of the developmental stage they are in. However, when they are not napping the day away, they should be playful, inquisitive, and energetic (some more than others). If you notice that your puppy is lazing around, or exhibiting a general lack of enthusiasm, consider taking them to the vet, as this could be a sign of a wide variety of illnesses, from minor bacterial infections to a virus such as canine parvovirus.", "Your puppy may stop eating for a number of reasons. Perhaps they are nervous about moving to a new place, at the same time, it could be something far more dire. Pay attention to their appetite, they should be happy to eat several times a day. If their appetite is low when they arrive and does not improve or it is good but decreases then you should consider visiting your vet. Keep in mind that very small puppies will only be able to eat small amounts regularly during the day.", "It is something that plagues us all, and when it strikes, it\u2019s no fun for anybody. While diarrhoea could just be caused by anxiety (i.e., moving to a new home), or by a change in diet it could also be caused by a virus or parasite. It could be a good idea to take a stool sample over to the vet for them to analyse. If, however, you notice that the diarrhoea has blood in it, you should take your puppy to the vet immediately, as this could be a sign of gastrointestinal disease.", "Just like with diarrhoea, vomiting could also just be a nervous reaction to a change in the routine. However, it could also be the result of something more serious. Perhaps your puppy has been eating their food too quickly, in which case you should consider giving them smaller meals at more frequent intervals to prevent them from scarfing it all down. If the vomiting persists, or is unusual (i.e., has blood in it) they should be taken to the vet immediately, as it could be symptomatic of something much larger.", "Just because your puppy can\u2019t speak to you, doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t try. If you notice your pup making unusual noises, or whimpering incessantly, it could be they are trying to tell you something about their health. It could very well be that they are just vying for attention, but if the whimpering persists, or if it seems like they are not whimpering to be noticed, it might mean that they are injured in some way, or possibly suffering from internal pain, which could indicate an illness. Use your best judgement, but don\u2019t hesitate to visit a vet if you think they are hurting.", "Puppies are still dogs, and dogs lick and scratch themselves. It\u2019s just part of being a dog. However, if you notice that they are really going after one spot in particular, it could be caused by a rash or an allergy, in which case you might want to consider getting them an antihistamine or soothing ointment \u2014 but only after getting the go ahead from your vet.", "Puppies are certainly no stranger to unusual behaviours, often chasing their own tail or things no one else can see. It is all part of how they are hardwired. But if it seems like they are walking around listlessly, or in a drunken manner, it could be symptomatic of low blood sugar or dehydration. Low blood sugar should be unlikely f your puppy is eating regularly and dehydration should be unlikely if your puppy is drinking water regularly. However both symptoms can exist as a result of various illnesses, if symptoms persist, you should take them to the vet as soon as you can, as this could become serious.", "OVERVIEW", "It may seem like the overall response to any symptom is to rush over to the vet, and this article is not intended to make an alarmist out of you, but the reality is that it can be very hard to tell when your puppy is just being a puppy or if there is something more serious going on below the surface. Use your best judgement when trying to help your puppy get back to normal, in most cases the symptoms above will be noticeable because they differ from what you are used to with your puppy. \u00a0If you are uncertain, never hesitate to let a vet take a look.

These animals are at a greater risk of suffering from stress and requiring veterinary attention, or passing away, during transport both by Air and Road.", "In these dogs the skull length is reduced, but the amount of soft tissue in the muzzle is not, resulting in the same amount of tissue being squeezed into a smaller area. It is generally believed that this characteristic has been deliberately selected in order to conform to breed standards and that it is a result of a preference for animals with flatter, more human looking features.", "Dogs with BAOS usually have a combination of four anatomical abnormalities that contribute to the disease, all of which occur more commonly in brachycephalic breeds: an elongated soft palate, Pinched or narrow nostrils, an underdeveloped windpipe and soft tissue masses protruding into the voicebox opening.", "Because all of these components make it more difficult to breathe, in situations of exercise, stress, excitement or hot conditions, an animal with these abnormalities may be unable to take deep or fast enough breaths leading to oxygen deprivation, a build up of carbon dioxide and an inability to properly regulate their body temperature through panting. This leads to distress and further increases respiratory rate, heart rate and temperature, creating a vicious cycle that can quickly lead to a life-threatening situation.", "Dogs experiencing a crisis situation due to brachycephalic syndrome typically benefit from oxygen, cool temperatures, sedatives, and in some cases more advance medical intervention including intubation.", "List of Brachycephalic animals", "Not all breeds are affected to the same degree. Additionally some breeds are not common in Australia. It is likely that the degree of risk is proportional to the degree of flatness of the face in different breeds.", "Symptoms of this condition do not seem to be an issue in young puppies but should be watched for in mature animals from approximately 9 months of age.", "If your pet is or does at times show any of the above signs of this problem, you must seriously consider whether it is appropriate to transport your animal. Please note that all major transporters within Australia and internationally have some form of limitation or waiver regarding the transport of Brachycephalic breeds and in the case your pet is severely affected even private transport by car may not be recommended. We suggest that you consult your veterinarian for further advice.", "The RSPCA has reported in its Animal Welfare Science Update #37, July 2012, that many owners of Brachycephalic dogs in a clinical study, reported a high frequency and severity of clinical signs in their dogs, without perceiving them as a problem. In other words, there is a misperception that dogs with BAOS are normal.", "Five common problems in pedigree dogs.", "The Misperception of Brachycephalic dogs as normal.", "Heat stress is a condition that these animals are particularly susceptible to due to their existing genetic and physical breed characteristics. Some animals will handle heat far better than others but all Brachycephalic animals have an impaired ability to properly regulate their body temperature to some degree.", "We do focus upon heat stress in our care of your animals, it is in fact the only risk factor with these animals that we have a partial ability to control. However it is important to be aware that a Brachycephalic animal suffering from over exertion, excitement or stress can suffer similar symptoms, leading to breathing difficulties, oxygen deprivation and possibly death in the absence of heat as a factor and in fact this situation can arise in a cool or air conditioned environment.", "These issues exist for all forms of transport, by road and by air. The nature of all animal transport is such that it is not possible for a driver or handler to monitor every animal at every moment, even with regular stops it is possible for an animal suffering from respiratory distress or heat stress to progress to a critical stage in a very short space of time with the risk that symptoms may go unnoticed and/or that by the time symptoms are noticed that it is not possible to get the animal appropriate care in time. Please note additionally that in some instances the physical location and time of day will be a factor in determining whether it is possible to get an animal to appropriate care in time.", "Dogs with brachycephalic airway syndrome should be fitted with a harness that does not tug at the neck area. It is not advisable to use a regular neck collar or choker chain for these dogs, since the collar can put undue pressure on the neck. We ask that owners provide an appropriate harness that fits the dog properly and that the dog is used to wearing. In the event that our drivers/handlers feel that your dog is pulling insistently and that this may be affecting your animals breathing they will limit the animals walks as much as is practical under the circumstances.", "Dogmovers insurance policy does not cover veterinary bills, death or loss associated with BAOS or any other existing physical condition that an animal may have. Such insurance is not available in Australia and to the best of our knowledge no pet carrier in Australia offers such insurance. It is possible for individuals to obtain cover for their personal companion animals through the RSPCA and other insurance providers.", "Dogmovers pet transport floats are not Air Conditioned and we make no representation that your animal will be transported in an air conditioned environment on our regional and interstate services. While air conditioning may be beneficial in keeping pets comfortable on short journeys it is our experience that the risks associated with using AC on longer trips outweigh the benefits.", "Sudden and extreme changes in temperature can be experienced by animals being removed from an air conditioned cage into a hot or humid environment, either for a toilet stop or at the end of a journey. These sudden changes are believed to cause excessive stress in affected animals and to be an additional risk factor for this condition.", "It is important to note here that while the external temperature is a factor in this condition and high temperatures are a risk factor, seriously affected animals are unable to properly regulate their body temperature even in a cool or air conditioned environment.", "If you are purchasing a mature Brachycephalic animal we suggest that you discuss this condition with the previous owner and ensure that an appropriate agreement is in place regarding ownership, liability and a refund of the purchase price in the event that the animal if affected seriously enough that it is unable to be transported to you.", "If you are purchasing a Brachycephalic puppy or kitten we suggest that you discuss this condition with the breeder including the condition of the parents of your animal. To date we have never seen signs or symptoms of this condition in animals under 6 months of age and do not apply any restrictions to the transport of pups or kittens.", "As previously stated not all Brachycephalic breeds are affected to the same degree and not all dogs within a breed are affected. We have specifically not seen this condition affect young pups but have seen it affect young animals from about 9 months on.", "However we have seen it affect otherwise healthy looking animals. We are aware of animals with symptoms of BAOS being found deceased when no other apparent risk factors were present, autopsies have indicated heat stress as a factor even when heat was not considered to be an issue or the animal was in an air conditioned vehicle.", "Unfortunately no matter how much care we take with the animals we are responsible for, occasionally an animal will become unwell or pass away whilst in our care. BAOC is recognised as the leading cause of death amongst companion animals in transport conditions. It is a condition closely aligned to an individual animals genetic condition and as such much of the risk is out of our control. We do seek to manage the additional risk factors as much as is possible but it is ultimately the owners responsibility to make an informed decision as to suitability for transport, given the animals current condition, previous issues and experience with the animal in stressful situations.", "In the event that an animal does experience issues during transport, it can be a stressful time for both the owner and our drivers. Unfortunately, some owners, when faced with such a situation seek to place the full responsibility for the problem on the transporter, in doing so ignoring that their animal had a serious pre existing condition.", "As Professional Pet transporters, it is our experience that this condition is the No. 1 cause of veterinary intervention and fatalities during transport. This fact is mirrored by published statistics from US airlines that have had to report injuries, losses and deaths of animals in transit since 2005. Since that time over half of all deaths have been attributed to Brachycephalic breeds with Bulldogs and pugs being overrepresented even within this figure.", "Restrictions on both the carriage of and liability for Brachycephalic breeds are common amongst both airlines and road transporters of domestic animals both within Australia and Internationally and several major international airlines refuse to move Brachycephalic animals on some or all or their routes.", "Those airlines that do not have complete restrictions invariably advise that these breeds are booked only on early morning or evening flights to avoid extreme changes in temperature and humidity when the animals are loaded or removed from the aircraft.", "0411 738 829", "Click here to enquire now", "Click here to send us a message", "Hi Guys It takes a team to rescue a Great Dane, Dogmovers are very much a big part of that team, I just have to\u2026", "Just wanted to say a huge thank you for your excellent service and care of Mack from Rockhampton to his new home with me south\u2026", "I want to say how impressed I am with your service and the care that you showed me, as well as my dog.

Whilst it is not our policy to insist every pet is vaccinated for every disease, it is important the owner accepts their failure to vaccinate may put their pet at greater risk at all times, not just during transport or kennelling.\u00a0", "Because we move many animals that are vaccinated but do not have vaccination cards, such as greyhounds, farm dogs and working dogs, we do not demand to see the vaccination details for every pet. Additionally, many animals are known to be vaccinated but the card is no longer available.", "It is important to note any animal, even vaccinated animals in our care, who have recently come into contact with a disease, may carry on or in their body that disease even though they themselves may not succumb to the disease and would be showing no signs or symptoms. There is no evidence unvaccinated animals are more likely to be carrying or pass on an illness but they are more likely to be able to contract those diseases for which they could otherwise have been vaccinated for. Whilst we make every endeavor to exclude sick animals, it is never possible for us to fully guarantee your pet will not come into contact with an animal that has or is carrying any illness. Likewise, we cannot guarantee your pet will not be walked in an area which has previously been used by an animal carrying any illness.", "It is essential all pet owners notify us in the event their pet is showing signs of an illness, either before or immediately following a trip, and all animals that are symptomatic for any contagious disease, must have their trip postponed until appropriate measures have been taken. For the good of all animals, we rely very heavily upon the owners of the pets we move to be honest regarding their pets health. In the event we accept an animal on board and subsequently find it has a condition which would have excluded it from travel at that time, we will deliver it to a vet for appropriate treatment at the owners cost. Such cost will usually entail boarding until we are next in the same area to collect the pet and can be quite expensive. If you are unsure about whether you pet should travel or not, please contact us to discuss as it will always be cheaper for you to deal with the issue at home, using your own vet, rather than for us to deal with the issue in another location.", "The advise for young animals is exactly the same. We strongly recommend you ensure your pet is fully vaccinated prior to any type of travel. Plus, we strongly recommend young animals should not be transported from the breeder within 10 days of having had their first vaccinations.", "However, as most Breeders and new owners prefer to transport puppies and kittens at around 8 weeks of age, it is not possible for them to be fully vaccinated. In this instance, there will always be an additional risk of a young animal contracting a disease with all forms of travel, including if you go and collect it yourself, because it will encounter new environments, other people and animals that may have come into contact with a micro organism that are still on their body. It would be wrong, however, to suggest this risk is larger than it is and it is possible to reduce such a risk with some basic precautions.", "Of greatest concern to us, is the period of time directly after a young animal has received its first vaccinations. Whilst the incidence of reactions to vaccinations itself is not high, we have found there is a higher incidence of animals falling ill from a range of diseases in the 10 days after. This is probably due to additional stress upon their immune system, and additionally, there is some evidence animals that were not themselves fully healthy at the time of receiving a vaccination, may be more likely to be able to transfer the disease they have been vaccinated against to other animals.", "As with the advice above for adult animals, it is essential all Breeders and Pet owners notify us in the event their pet is showing signs of any illness, either before or immediately following a trip, and all animals that are symptomatic for any contagious disease, must have their trip postponed until appropriate measures have been taken.", "In the event you are aware your new pup or kitten has had a health issue but your breeder is unwilling to keep it for another 2 weeks until it has fully recovered, I would suggest you consider terminating the contract and seek another breeder. It is important to note that the breeder does have ongoing responsibilities with respect to the health of your new pet under consumer law and such obligations do require the breeder ensures the animal is in a fit state to travel and this obligation does not stop at a \u201cvet check\u201d when they are being vaccinated.", "We do take the health of all animals in our care very seriously and endeavour to always have appropriate controls in place to stop or minimise the spread of any disease. We believe the incidence of pets contracting an illness during, or around the time of travel with us, is very low and is likely no higher than the normal everyday risk for animals in contact with other animals. However, we are not in a position to take responsibility for animals that may contract a disease in a manner outside of our control, which would otherwise be considered a normal risk for any pet in the given circumstances.", "If you are uncertain about any of the above, please contact us directly to discuss your concerns or to arrange any specific requirements that may be required for your pet.", "The\u00a0core vaccines\u00a0vets recommend for all Australian dogs are:", "Additionally, vets recommend that any dog who meets other dogs is also vaccinated against:", "The addition of these\u00a0non-core\u00a0vaccines to\u00a0the core vaccines is called a\u00a0C5 vaccination.", "All dog owners should be aware of\u00a0the signs of parvo, distemper, hepatitis and kennel cough.", "The other dog vaccines available in Australia are only needed in specific situations:", "We recommend that you discuss your vaccination options with your Veterinary specialist.", "For more than 20 years the routine vaccination for most dogs in Australia has been the ubiquitous \u201cC5\u201d \u2013 a single injection delivering vaccine designed to protect against\u00a0Distemper, Canine Hepatitis (Adenovirus), Parvovirus, Parainflueneza and Bordetella.", "This type of vaccine had to be delivered three times to puppies, ideally at 6, 12 and 16 weeks of age and is believed to be very effective. Some vets still use and recommend this type of vaccine and this recommended schedule.", "However, In the past few years vaccines have been developed which enable an \u201cearly finish\u201d to puppy vaccinations \u2013 initially at 12 weeks of age, and more recently at\u00a010 weeks\u00a0of age. These vaccines protect puppies from an earlier age, reducing the risk of the fatal \u201cparvovirus\u201d, and enabling puppies to get out and socialise earlier. This may improves their confidence and reduce the likelihood of them developing some anxiety or aggression problems.", "A further benefit to owners is a reduction from three to two puppy vaccinations, reducing the costs of those early months of puppy ownership.", "These vaccines also offer benefits to adult dogs in that they are registered to protect adults from\u00a0Distemper, Hepatitis\u00a0and\u00a0Parvovirus\u00a0for\u00a0three years, instead of the usual one-year. This is very worthwhile because the risk of side effects after vaccination is proportional to the number of ingredients in the vaccine \u2013 the new regime uses only two (instead of five) components for two years out of three. It is no \u201cstronger\u201d or dangerous than the older C5 vaccine, and reduces the risks of complications by reducing the number of vaccines received over the years.", "We recommend that you ask your Veterinary Specialist about newer vaccines that may reduce the total number of vaccines your pet may need.", "0411 738 829", "Click here to enquire now", "Click here to send us a message", "Hi Guys It takes a team to rescue a Great Dane, Dogmovers are very much a big part of that team, I just have to\u2026", "Just wanted to say a huge thank you for your excellent service and care of Mack from Rockhampton to his new home with me south\u2026", "I want to say how impressed I am with your service and the care that you showed me, as well as my dog.
