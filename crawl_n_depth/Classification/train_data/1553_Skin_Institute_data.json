These veins empty into the deep venous system at the Saphenofemerol Junction (SFJ) in the groin, and Saphenopopliteal Junction (SPJ) behind the knee, respectively.", "The blood pressure in the veins is significantly less than in the arteries, and not enough to return blood from the foot to the heart in the standing or sitting position. In order for blood to return from the lower limbs against gravity there are multiple one-way valves throughout the length of the vein. Varicose veins result when there is failure of these valves and blood backflows down into\u00a0the superficial venous system and\u00a0its branches. These veins subsequently become dilated and tortuous and, if close to the skin, can be seen as visible lumpy varicose veins, but are not always visible. Due to the retrograde flow within these veins, a low pressure becomes a high pressure system, known as\u00a0", "chronic venous hypertension", ". As a result there is reduced oxygenation of local tissues, there is often\u00a0leakage of intravascular fluid into the surrounding tissue to cause oedema and there can be inflammation. These manifest in a variety of symptoms such as swelling, aching, cramping, pain and restless legs.\u00a0 The skin can also become compromised with poor healing, skin pigmentation, venous eczema and venous ulceration.

Tumescent anaesthesia is injected\u00a0around the vein to be treated, to\u00a0protect the surrounding tissue and make the procedure painless for the patient.

Therefore, as you can imagine, when the lesion is on your face the addition of this safety margin can create a significant defect, and may come very close to, or involve part of an important structure such as your eye. Once the cancer is removed with the safety margin, the defect is closed with stitches immediately.\u00a0 The specimen is then sent to the local laboratory for processing, the results of which can sometime take up to 10 days to be reported. If the results indicate that the cancer cells were not completely removed, then another appointment and further surgery is necessary to ensure complete clearance of cancer.", "In contrast with Mohs surgery, the surgeon again uses a skin marker pen to draw around the margin of the cancer. The cancer is then removed with a minimal safety margin (usually 1mm outside the pen mark). After the cancer is removed, the wound is dressed but not stitched.

Because hyaluron is what gives skin it\u2019s elasticity and firmness, damage to these fibres makes it harder for your skin to retain its shape, resulting in lines and wrinkles. The more fibres are damaged and the more water is lost, the deeper and harsher these wrinkles will appear. This is why sun exposure and the resulting dehydration is a major cause of prematurely aged skin.", "Think of hydrated skin as a grape and dehydrated skin as a raisin, with all the moisture removed. Hydrated skin tends to be plump, smooth and firm, while dehydrated skin feels dry, flaky and rough. If skin is dehydrated for a long period of time, you will start to notice fine lines and wrinkles forming.", "Because it affects your skin\u2019s protective barrier, dehydration can make your skin more reactive to products and environmental factors. If you find that your skin is increasingly sensitive to temperature or certain skincare products, it may be dehydrated.", "\u00a0", "To treat damaged skin and reduce the signs of dehydration, you need to replenish your NMF and balance your stratum corneum. This will increase the water content and lead to stronger, healthier, less sensitive skin.", "The simplest first step is drinking more water.

These will be an important reference point. \u201cEnsuring your facial features are harmonious is crucial,\u201d Sarah says. \u201cImproving one feature of the face too much while neglecting others means our primitive brain can perceive a face as \u2018wrong\u2019.
