My husband and I made a considered decision to move from a system that was underperforming, outdated, slow and caused many independent audit issues. My husband refused to use the old system as it was not logical, difficult to find reports, difficult to find settings and was extremely hard to trouble shoot issues as they arose. A three way balance at the end of each month took approximately 16 hours to achieve and in the holiday industry this is time we unfortunately did not have to spare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Changing to REI Master has been a breath of fresh air. The system is easy to use, intuitive, logical, simple, fast and we can get a three way balance within minutes. My husband loves REI Master and finds it extremely easy to navigate his way around the system. He is not fearful of the system and now creates and amends bookings, creates receipts and charges to accounts and can even print reports. This has proved invaluable as I can now ask him to help me out in reception and he is comfortable and confident to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                I love REI Master too. I love the simplicity of the system, it is really easy to find reports, trouble shoot issues, update owner, supplier and agent details, charge accounts, delete mistakes and end of month is a breeze. I can actually perform an end of month solo using REI Master. My two favourite features of the system are the ability to use the pencil in the booking grid to drag over dates and create a booking and the ability to right mouse click on a guests name in the booking grid and print statements and guest registration forms. I love the system and its functionalities and my husband and I are so glad we changed. I am an avid REI Master supporter and would thoroughly recommend other accommodation Managers to change to this system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                We are also extremely impressed with the support staff at REI Master and the fact that our service calls are responded to within 30 minutes of lodging a call. This allows us to move on with our issues quickly. I remember with our previous systems we would wait up to 24 hours for our issues to be addressed and resolved. The support staff at REI Master are professional, knowledgeable and extremely patient with our issues and we enjoy the interaction. We don\u2019t feel like we are a number when we call REI Master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                The only regret we have is that we didn\u2019t convert to REI Master sooner as the impact the system has had on our business is immeasurable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Thank you REI Master and your wonderful professional support team for their amazing customer service day in day out.\r\n                            ", "Carla Kazinoti ", "Resident Manager", "Call us today and we're confident that you'll be adding you testimonial to this page too!", "Insert your name here", "Principal - Your Business", "Keep up on our always evolving product features and technology.

You should know, but if you don't already, you have an excellent and very dedicated team. My own team have needed a fair bit of hand-holding as we transition, but your team have been tireless, patient and always pleasant. We did not have anything like this level of support with our past software provider. It was a hard decision to change as I was not sure if the service would be better. However, we are all very pleased with the assistance we have had and I am convinced the change was worthwhile. I thought it was about time I wrote and expressed our gratitude. Thank you and now, because of your software and your team (and my team) The Hub continues to Rock!", "Bridget Goodwin", "Principal - The Hub", "I changed our software to EzyRez in all of our buildings. It was one of the best decisions I ever made. The change over was very smooth and the service from the support team was and still is exceptional.

My husband and I made a considered decision to move from a system that was underperforming, outdated, slow and caused many independent audit issues. My husband refused to use the old system as it was not logical, difficult to find reports, difficult to find settings and was extremely hard to trouble shoot issues as they arose. A three way balance at the end of each month took approximately 16 hours to achieve and in the holiday industry this is time we unfortunately did not have to spare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Changing to REI Master has been a breath of fresh air. The system is easy to use, intuitive, logical, simple, fast and we can get a three way balance within minutes. My husband loves REI Master and finds it extremely easy to navigate his way around the system. He is not fearful of the system and now creates and amends bookings, creates receipts and charges to accounts and can even print reports. This has proved invaluable as I can now ask him to help me out in reception and he is comfortable and confident to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                I love REI Master too. I love the simplicity of the system, it is really easy to find reports, trouble shoot issues, update owner, supplier and agent details, charge accounts, delete mistakes and end of month is a breeze. I can actually perform an end of month solo using REI Master. My two favourite features of the system are the ability to use the pencil in the booking grid to drag over dates and create a booking and the ability to right mouse click on a guests name in the booking grid and print statements and guest registration forms. I love the system and its functionalities and my husband and I are so glad we changed. I am an avid REI Master supporter and would thoroughly recommend other accommodation Managers to change to this system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                We are also extremely impressed with the support staff at REI Master and the fact that our service calls are responded to within 30 minutes of lodging a call. This allows us to move on with our issues quickly. I remember with our previous systems we would wait up to 24 hours for our issues to be addressed and resolved. The support staff at REI Master are professional, knowledgeable and extremely patient with our issues and we enjoy the interaction. We don\u2019t feel like we are a number when we call REI Master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                The only regret we have is that we didn\u2019t convert to REI Master sooner as the impact the system has had on our business is immeasurable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Thank you REI Master and your wonderful professional support team for their amazing customer service day in day out.\r\n                            ", "Carla Kazinoti ", "Resident Manager", "Call us today and we're confident that you'll be adding you testimonial to this page too!", "Insert your name here", "Principal - Your Business", "Keep up on our always evolving product features and technology.
