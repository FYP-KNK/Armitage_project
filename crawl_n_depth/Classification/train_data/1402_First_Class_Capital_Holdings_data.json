By following these tips, you can be much more comfortable in approaching the hiring process, and you will have better chance of finding the person that is a perfect fit for your company.", "Hiring, when it all comes down to it, is about two things. The position you\u2019re hiring for, and the prospective employee. Knowing what you want is all about describing the position.

If you have particular needs that must be met, make sure to include them, but be aware that you are unlikely to find someone who fulfils every single requirement on your list. Using your wish-list as a guide, as opposed to a list of demands, will be more likely to find you the right candidate.", "Making your existing team part of the hiring process is one of the smartest decisions you can make when bringing on new staff. It\u2019s likely that they will be working more closely with the new employee than you will, so making sure that personalities mesh from the outset should be a given. ", "Including your current employees in the hiring process has other benefits too. They are often more savvy to the actual day-to-day demands of a position, so can provide more pertinent information than your job description will. They can also share their experiences with prospective candidates to provide insight into the company culture. ", "The most important aspect of this tip is that both your existing staff and your prospective employee will see that their opinions are respected and acted upon, giving them more emotional investment in your business. This will translate to staff loyalty, longevity of positions, and a company culture that people want to be a part of. ", "Unfortunately, it happens all to often that a candidate for a position will be perfect on paper, possessing all the necessary skills and more, but will be impossible to work with, because of their attitude. It really is best to avoid hiring people like this wherever possible. ", "You may be tempted to hire the difficult genius, because of the skills they bring to your business, but if they are negatively affecting the social dynamic of your team, they could end up costing you much more than they provide. Instead, look for candidates who get along with the people in your office, who are friendly and respectful to everyone from the cleaner to the CEO. These are the people that will make your company a more comfortable place to work.", "Try to stay humble when you\u2019re hiring. This might sound harsh, but you\u2019re not doing your candidate a favour by employing them. Hiring staff is just a business transaction, in that they have skills you require, and you have a position they require. They don\u2019t owe you anything, other than their dedication to your business in exchange for compensation. Loyalty and respect need to be earned.", "Having said that, it works both ways. Candidates are not doing you a favour by coming to work for you.

Sometimes the perfect person for your position won\u2019t look like the perfect person on paper. Consider the possibility that the most brilliant genius you\u2019ll ever meet might not own a suit, or have enough money for a haircut.", "Keeping an open mind doesn\u2019t just stop at appearance or education. It may be possible that you have a candidate that would suit your company perfectly, but doesn\u2019t have the requisite skills for the advertised position. Sometimes, you may need to rethink the job description, especially if you\u2019re unwilling to lose this person who is an ideal cultural fit for your company.", "This is the most important tip to remember! Businesses revolve around people, not the other way around. The focus on company culture over the last couple of decades has really embraced this premise, and it is one of the most important factors to consider when employing new staff.", "When you meet a person who fits your company culture, you will know. They will embrace your ideas, be positive about the direction your company is taking, and be able to work cohesively with your team from the outset. This is something that can\u2019t be taught. What can be taught, however, are the skills required to fulfil the role outlined in your job description. While you should definitely be looking for someone who can work with your required tools, their current level of ability should be treated more leniently. By working with these tools every day, they will become experts, and will have you to thank for it. This, in turn, feeds back into the positive company culture.", "Flexibility is paramount in all aspects of your business. You need to be able to adapt to gain the most from what you do. This rings equally true with your staff. By allowing deviation from the strict 9-5 routines of normal business life, you have the potential to achieve outstanding results from your employees.", "If your business does not actually need to stick to strict routines, consider allowing employees to dictate their own starting times. This will allow you to get the most out of both your early risers, and your night owls. Encourage a positive work/life balance by providing comfortable work hours for parents. Give people the opportunity to work from home at times, if their position allows. Provide a socially responsible workplace by actively encouraging people to leave early to do volunteer work.

", "What you think you need from a new employee, and what you actually require aren\u2019t always the same thing. Sometimes, when you are so deep in the running of your business, you can\u2019t see the forest for the trees. It\u2019s a good idea to take a step back occasionally, and have a conversation with someone about what you\u2019re doing.", "There are plenty of business groups and events that you can be a part of, either virtually through social sites like Facebook or LinkedIn, or in the real world, through organisations like Meetup or Eventbrite. They will help you keep abreast of industry trends and required skills, and will be able to advise on the current state of potential employees available. They will help you understand if you are actually attracting the right people to your business in the first place, and if you\u2019re new to hiring, they can help you with tips and assistance. Never be afraid to ask for help.", "It can be a good idea to offer short term probationary contracts, once you\u2019ve hired someone, before you offer them a more permanent position. Not only does this give you the opportunity to see if your new employee is capable, and able to meet your expectations, but it will also allow them to experience the way your company works. ", "While CVs and references may give glowing reports about your candidate, nothing compares to you actually being able to experience their work ethic. You will see first hand if they really do fit your company culture, and whether they are able to learn the skills you require. They will get the opportunity to see if your company culture really is all you promised, and whether the job they are going to be doing is the same as the one they applied for.", "If, after all of these measures, the person you employ isn\u2019t right for your business, you need to be able to move on and start again. Don\u2019t be disgruntled, or rue the expense of a failed hire, as any stumbling block along the way will get you one step closer to finding the perfect staff. Don\u2019t hold on to employees if they clearly don\u2019t fit in with your company culture, as it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to bring them around to it.", "Make sure to learn from your mistakes, though.

What we should be looking for is PCW paper \u2013 that is Post Consumer Waste \u2013 products.

Not just an Instagram Fad (though seriously there are some inspiring accounts to follow out there to give you a bit of green-spiration!), having plants in your office contributes to more than the aesthetics. Results from the NASA Clean Air Study suggested that certain indoor plants are extremely efficient at filtering out toxic emissions from your office (and household) furniture and supplies. So not only do they improve air quality like all plants (which helps avoid that stuffy, 3 pm slump) but they are capable of removing harmful Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from the air. Toxic agents like benzene,\u00a0formaldehyde\u00a0and\u00a0trichloroethylene are emitted from things like our desks and even the paints on the walls. By installing some easy-care plants like the Peace Lily, Snake Plant (commonly known as Mother-in-law\u2019s tongue) or English Ivy, you\u2019re removing those harmful nasties from your office (and making yourself Insta worthy in the process!)", "\u00a0", "Going digital has several perks to the green crusade. Firstly, as more and more offices and small businesses jump on the cloud-based software bandwagon, the less paper we use.

Another upside is it allows for employees to work remotely, which cuts down on commuter miles, one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse emissions", "\u00a0", "Joining up to workplace challenges like 10,000 Steps or Ride to Work Day, not only gets you and your workers moving \u2013 which results in a healthier, more productive workplace \u2013 but they promote alternatives to using cars or public transport to get around. A big win for the environment \u2013 and your business! By incentivizing or encouraging your employees (and yourself) to get active and get moving, you\u2019re making a small step to normalise biking or walking to work.

These hurdles could include seasonal stock requirements, annual low periods in trading, or the inevitable waiting times between invoice payments. Once you have identified where the cashflow blockages are likely to occur, you can plan for them, instead of flying blind.", "It\u2019s a good idea to get into the habit of using a rolling forecast, preferably covering 12-16 weeks.

Just keep an ear out for the inner pessimist.", "You don\u2019t need to give in to the negativity, but acknowledging that there will be unforeseeable situations during the life of your business is a very intelligent way to approach your own startup.", "In regards to your cashflow forecast, it is good idea to overestimate the amount you are likely to spend, and underestimate the amount you are likely to make. This will help you avoid cashflow holdups, or at least mitigate the impact these holdups have on your capital.", "\u00a0", "One of the things that will seriously tie up your projected cashflow is late payment from your customers. To make sure that this is not an ongoing issue, you need to stay strong, and demand on-time payment. To do this, you will need to establish a strong invoicing process, and you must keep an eagle-eye on the dates and amounts of invoices.", "It may sound harsh, but if you have repeat offenders who constantly pay late, you should reconsider your working relationship with them. It may be a sign that they have cashflow issues of their own, which could eventuate in non payment.", "By being strict with your debtors, you will establish a culture of on-time payment. This will mean that your capital is yours to use, and is not tied up in paperwork.", "This is not a one-way street, though.

By constantly providing on-time payments to your suppliers, you will establish strong working relationships that will benefit you in the long-run.", "\u00a0", "While on the topic of invoicing, early payment is even better than on-time payment. This is rarely achieved on its own, as other businesses have their own cashflow needs to consider.  If you do want people to pay more quickly, however, incentives for early payment can work extremely well.", "This will most likely be in the form of a small discount on your invoice price, e.g. 3-5%. You could offer higher discounts on bulk orders too, to make sure that larger payments are processed in a timely manner. While this will cut down on your margins slightly, it does go a long way towards establishing that previously mentioned culture of payment.", "Discounts are not the only incentives, either. You can extend bonus offers on future purchases, or give special gifts that are only available through early payment. These incentives should be factored into your business plan and cashflow forecasts, as well, to make sure that they are not impacting too much on your working capital.", "\u00a0", "It might seem like a strange tip for optimising cashflow, but it is any extremely important one for a couple of reasons.", "Wages or salaries are an integral part of any business, and most business owners understand that.

By paying yourself a salary, you will be able to make sure you don\u2019t have personal financial pressures to add on top of that stress.", "\u00a0", "While your business definitely requires you to be working there, you should be wary of hiring new employees until your business absolutely can\u2019t live without them. The main, and obvious, reason for this is that hiring new staff increases your expenditure, making it harder for your business to run profitably, without necessarily bringing in more revenue.", "If you are over-stretched and can\u2019t work any harder, consider outsourcing some of the tasks that aren\u2019t part of the core of your business. Outsourcing will allow you to only use the skills of other people when they are required, and you can seek people with specific skills that you may not possess, such as administration, HR, accounting, and finance. ", "Staffing is something that you constantly need to reassess, though. Don\u2019t hold out on hiring for the sake of expenditure, if it means that you are going to burn out and not be able to run your business effectively. Make sure that, when you do hire, you are hiring the right person for your company, and not just someone to fill the space. Being choosy will definitely pay off in the long run.", "\u00a0", "Keeping your stock low may seem counter-intuitive, but if you formulate your initial business plan to accommodate this, it will certainly help with your cashflow. While this may not suit more established businesses, it is certainly a good idea for startups to run on this business model.", "Having excess stock is bad for your cashflow for two main reasons. Firstly, your capital is tied up in goods, and you can\u2019t access it for other purposes, such as purchasing other stock, paying wages, or marketing. Secondly, the more stock you have, the more it costs to store it. ", "To make this plan work, you will need to factor in the time it takes to receive your stock, and hold just enough to satisfy projected sales at any given time.", "This is not the ideal ongoing business model, in that you will need to order smaller amounts of stock more frequently, which may impact on both your sales margins, and the cost per unit from your supplier. This model is designed to help you establish a good cashflow, though, and grow your business. Once your business is making more money, you can reassess your purchasing strategies.
