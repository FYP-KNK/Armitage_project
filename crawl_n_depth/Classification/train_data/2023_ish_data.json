Every student is uniquely identified in the results and students should be informed of that fact. Not everyone feels comfortable with the fact that every bit of study you do should be recorded and cross-referenced against your social and political choices.", "You would have thought that the introduction of yet another layer of red-tape, the Unique Student Identifier, would eliminate the need for increasing the complexity of AVETMISS.

Put the \u201c4\u201d into the unit field. The \u201c30\u201d into the street number. And the \u201cWilson St\u201d into the street name. We could even write a computer algorithm to do this for us. But if it were that simple, the people at NCVER could do it themselves. Let\u2019s take the address that I put on all our business correspondence: \u201clevel one, 30 Wilson St\u201d. That is the address that causes the postoffice to put mail in the right mailbox. But is \u201clevel one\u201d a building name?

Can you have a building name as well as a street number?", "If we consult the ", "QAS software from Experian", ", I find that \u201clevel one, 30 Wilson St\u201d should actually be entered as \u201cUnit 4, 30-34 Wilson St\u201d.
