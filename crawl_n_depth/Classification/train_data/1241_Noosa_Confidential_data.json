Everyone knows the ancestral tale about meeting a lion face to face \u2013 anxiety is the feeling and thoughts\n    that motivate you to run! However, in today\u2019s society, we are now faced with unparalleled \u201cperceived\u201d threats, compounded by lifestyles that focus\n    on certainty and attaining a false sense of security instead of acceptance of change and the fluidity of the human experience. These beliefs keep us\n    stuck and this is causing men, women,\u00a0and children to live in a constant state of \u201cI am not ok.\u201d", "For some people, this state of I am not ok has supported success in home and work. It motivates them to cross the t\u2019s and dot the I\u2019s. It makes sure the\n    details are reviewed and all potential threats perceived and accounted for. And while this may seem like a perfectly sound path, the truth is that\n    the person who succeeds as a result of this fear-driven need for perfection, with no allowance for human error or critique, will eventually struggle\n    with feelings of worthlessness, or lack of meaning and purpose,\u00a0when they cannot sustain perfection and therefore the success, they actually achieve\n    is hollow and unfulfilling.", "The key to making anxiety usefully is to understand and choose.", "\n", "Anxiety sufferers,\u00a0for the most part are \u201cdo-ers.\u201d When they feel that sensation come on they seek a solution to change the situation. Depending on\n    the driving beliefs that underlie the anxiety the doing behaviour will vary. For some it might be an avoidance of situations for others it will manifest\n    as a controlling attitude and pro-activeness.", "This is where anxiety is subjective. It is different for every person and so to\u00a0is the solution.", "Anxiety,\u00a0when not done in the right way, can cause havoc. The manifestation of symptoms includes racing heart, sweaty hands, dry mouth, nausea and\n    panic attacks to insomnia, constant overwhelm, stress, loss of libido, digestive issues and emotional instability. Anxiety is a desire for control\n    and a need to prevent things from happening. It keeps the individual in the future, taking them from the now and the ability to truly connect with\n    and enjoy life.", "When a person can own the way, they do anxiety just like they own the way they brush their teeth, cook eggs or make love, they create the opportunity to\n    learn a new way.
