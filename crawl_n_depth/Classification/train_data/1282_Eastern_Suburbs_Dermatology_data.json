They are then replenished by new cells from below. It normally takes 28 days for the deepest cells to reach the outermost layer. Unfortunately, sometimes this is a slow and haphazard process that does not allow your skin to shed evenly which over time and with sun exposure can lead to areas of varying pigmentation, textural changes and loss of elasticity.", "The purpose of a facial chemical peel is to cause an even, controlled shedding of several layers of damaged skin cells, leaving behind a new, fresher layer of skin with a more even texture and colour", ", similar to a snake shedding its skin.", "Different chemicals are used in facial chemical peels. The chemical used is dependent on the desired depth of the facial peel. In general, glycolic acid is used for superficial chemical peels and trichloroacetic acid for medium depth chemical peels. Deeper peels can be achieved with the chemical phenol, but this is more hazardous and is rarely used today with the advent of laser resurfacing for deeper wrinkles.", "Alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) peels are used for superficial peels. The most commonly used acid is glycolic acid. The AHA\u2019s are a naturally occurring group of substances usually found in fruits so AHA\u2019s are also referred to as fruit acids. They work by loosening the bonds between the superficial skin cells allowing them to be removed more easily. Often as preparation prior to a chemical skin peel your doctor will ask you to use products that contain AHA or tretinoin (a form of Vitamin A) to remove some of the surface skin layers, so that when your acid peel is applied the process is more even.", "The strength of the glycolic acid chemical peel applied depends on your skin type and the condition that is being treated. A normal course of glycolic acid chemical peels is four to six depending on your individual needs and response to each peel. The typical response to a glycolic acid chemical peel is similar to a mild sun or windburn. The redness typically settles within 24 hours and peeling of the skin in small flakes lasts for three to five days to leave a fresher, smoother complexion. Repeat chemical peels are normally given at one to two week intervals.", "The trichloroacetic acid (TCA) peel is helpful for:", "TCA chemical peels are performed as an outpatient procedure at our clinic.", "A number of applications (one to several) of TCA are applied to your skin to create a controlled chemical burn.", "Patients normally experience a few minutes of burning and stinging after the medication is applied.
