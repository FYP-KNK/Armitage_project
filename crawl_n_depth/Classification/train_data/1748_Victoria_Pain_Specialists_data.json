It tends to resolve on its own with self-care and there are no long-term effects. The majority of acute lower back pain is mechanical in nature, which means that there is a temporary disturbance in the way the many components of the back fit together and work. Components of your back include the spinal vertebrae or bones, the intervertebral discs between the bones, the spinal cord and multiple nerves and many different muscles, tendons and ligaments.

The lower back includes the five lumbar vertebral bones called L1, L2, L3, L4 and L5 (Figure 1). These bones support most of the weight of your upper body. Between these vertebrae are supportive soft, round, elastic pads called the intervertebral discs (Figure 2). These discs act like shock absorbers throughout your spine to cushion & support the vertebral bones as your body & spine move in all directions. The vertebrae and discs are held in place by bands of tough tissue that run up and down over them. These bands of tissue are called ligaments.

When these joints cause lower back pain it hurts when you extend your back (look upwards) and when someone puts pressure on your facet joints by pushing on them or twisting your spine. Facet joint pain is a pain that is relatively common to treat by using nerve blocks and other interventional treatments like radiofrequency (see below).", "The sacroiliac joints are the lowest joints in your spine (Figure 4).

If you pain is reduced by the test injections, then you may progress to a treatment called radiofrequency neurotomy.", "Radiofrequency treatments use current that applied directly to nerve(s), through needles, that generate high temperatures (90\u00b0C) at the tips of the needles which then breaks down the nerves. This can then result in prolonged pain relief lasting anything from 4 months to 2 years. This is called radiofrequency neurotomy.

This is called pulsed radiofrequency.", "Neurostimulation (spinal cord stimulation) Neurostimulation is when we can activate parts of the nervous system using microelectrodes connected to a small implantable battery. This uses the same principle as pacemakers that are used to control an abnormal heartbeat, except now we can use these specialised pacemakers to control abnormal nerve function that causes chronic pain. We can pace the nerves, which scrambles the pain signals of the nerves and reduces pain.

Laminectomy and discectomy are frequently performed together and the combination is one of the more common ways to remove pressure on a nerve root from a herniated disc or bone spur.", "Foraminotomy is an operation that cleans out or enlarges the bony hole (foramen) where a nerve exits the spinal column. Bulging discs or joints thickened with age can cause narrowing of the space through which the spinal nerve exits and can press on the nerve, resulting in pain, numbness, and weakness in an arm or leg. Small pieces of bone over the nerve are removed through a small slit, allowing the surgeon to cut away the blockage and relieve pressure on the nerve.", "Spinal fusion is used to strengthen the spine and prevent painful movements in people with degenerative disc disease or spondylolisthesis (following laminectomy). The spinal disc between two or more vertebrae is removed and the adjacent vertebrae are \u201cfused\u201d by bone grafts and/or metal devices secured by screws. The fusion can be performed through the abdomen, a procedure known as an anterior lumbar interbody fusion, or through the back, called posterior fusion. Spinal fusion may result in some loss of flexibility in the spine and requires a long recovery period to allow the bone grafts to grow and fuse the vertebrae together. Spinal fusion has been associated with an acceleration of disc degeneration at adjacent levels of the spine.", "Artificial disc replacement is considered an alternative to spinal fusion for the treatment of people with severely damaged discs. The procedure is a new therapy and currently undergoing research.", "Recurring back pain resulting from improper body mechanics is often preventable by avoiding movements that jolt or strain the back, maintaining correct posture, and lifting objects properly.
