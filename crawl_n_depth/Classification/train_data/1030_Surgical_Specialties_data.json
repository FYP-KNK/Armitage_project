Prolonged use is known to affect sexual function and libido in both men and women.

Regional anesthetic techniques can decrease post-operative pain to a manageable level allowing the patient to recover without succumbing to the effects of opioids in the body. Nerve blocks are becoming more widely used for orthopaedic related surgeries since it often allows the patient to return home hours after the surgery has been successful.", "Blockade of plexuses or peripheral nerves will provide selective analgesia in those parts of the body supplied by the plexus or nerves. These techniques can either be used to provide anesthesia for the surgery or specifically for postoperative pain relief. The practice of regional anesthesia has expanded greatly over the past two decades. As nerve block techniques, availability of training programs, equipment and technology have progressed, more patients are benefiting from superior non-narcotic postoperative pain control reducing the need for opioids and their related complications.

With up to 70% of patients who undergo a total hip or knee replacement receiving blood transfusions, the conclusion that infection rates were significantly increased following allogeneic transfusions may bring further attention to this area.", "In a level III post-hoc analysis, researchers stratified more that 12,000 patients into three groups: those that received no transfusion (n=6313), autologous blood transfusion (n=1902) and allogeneic blood transfusion (with or without autologous blood transfusion (n=3962).     Post-operative infection by type (lower or upper respiratory tract infection, bone and joint infection, wound inflammation or infection, urinary tract infection and other infections) was recorded.    The rate of infection was 9.9% in patients with allogeneic transfusions, compared to 7.9% in patients not receiving an allogeneic transfusion.  This difference was statistically different (P=0.003).", "In a similarly titled paper, also published in JBJS, researchers from Duke University Medical Centre in North Carolina, and the University of California in San Francisco also concluded that perioperative allogeneic transfusion was associated with a higher rate of reoperations for suspected acute infection.  3352 patients were treated with a total hip or knee arthroplasty (1730 total knee and 1622 total hip) and included in the study.  836 cases were given an allogeneic infusion and 910 had an autologous-only infusion.  Reoperation rate for suspected infection was higher in the cases with allogeneic exposure (1.67%), compared to 0.72% in those without allogeneic exposure (p = 0.013).  When adjusted, however, for total number of units transfused and ASA score, allogeneic exposure was not a significant predictor of reoperation for infection.", "Despite these potentially conflicting findings, there is no doubt that hospital-acquired infections, in any form, result in significant costs to the healthcare system.  A report in 2009 by the Centre for Disease Control, estimated that the overall annual direct costs of hospital-acquired infections in the US ranged from $28.4 to 33.8 billion.  The benefits of prevention range from a low of $5.7 billion to $31.5 billion.  These figures certainly warrant the further research and investigation into the possible causes, and more importantly, methods to prevent these infections.", "Whilst the number of infections in Australia is difficult to trace, the Australian National Joint Replacement Registry reported 48,783 total knee replacements and 38,432 total hip replacements in 2013.

Revision procedures for these infections result in greater blood loss, longer operating times, more frequent complications along with increases in the total number of hospitalization and longer hospital stays.", "The University of Texas Health Science Centre have collaborated with Rice University and Shriners Hospital for Children in the USA to develop an application that may potentially reduce implant-associated bone infections.  The researchers, led by Catherine Ambrose, Ph.D, an associate professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the UTHealth Medical found that porous metal implants that were coated with the microspheres prevented infection in 100% of the 11 specimens studied. In the tissue and bone surrounding the implants that were not coated with the antibiotic delivery system, infection occurred at a 64% rate.", "The Universities\u2019 press release quoted Ambrose as saying that the microspheres would appear to overcome a number of obstacles health care teams currently face when treating osteomyelitis\u2014bone infection.  The microspheres could be administered directly at the surgical site, eliminating the need for systemic antibiotics that impact the entire body. Ambrose noted that, \u201cbecause the antibiotic delivery system is microscopic in size, it does not appear to interfere with the healing after a total joint replacement.\u201d  These findings demonstrate the potential of antibiotic microspheres and have recently been published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

Early studies in orthopaedics did not produce solid conclusions about overall efficacy.  A 2006 meta-analysis found that tranexamic acid (TXA)was associated with fewer postoperative transfusions and identified a dose-dependant effect.  A recent retrospective study of more than 2,000 primary arthroplasty patients reported no increase in the rate of symptomatic thrombotic events when used for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Wingerter, MD, PhD, presented these results at the recent meeting in March for patients undergoing either primary or revision hip or knee arthroplasty.  \u201cTransexamic acid continues to support a decreased transfusion rate following both primary and revision hip and knee surgery without any increase in thromboembolic events.\u201d", "Wingerter and colleagues at Washington University School of Medicine performed a database search of all primary and revision hip and knee replacement surgeries to compare transfusion rates.  Overall the study included 1,320 hip cases and 886 knee cases.  They found no significant difference in demographic data between pre-TXA and post-TXA groups.  The investigators found the transfusion ate for all hip cases combined was 41.7% pre-TXA, which decreased to 13% after TXA.  The rate from knee cases decreased from 25% to 7%.", "For the rate of thromboembolic events (VTE\u2019s), \u201cthere was no significant difference in the incidence of at 4 weeks to 6 weeks or at 6 months.  There was an absolute lower percentage in our patient group that was receiving TXA.\u201d Wingerter said.", "The interest in the importance of this type of therapy has certainly increased in recent years.

Initial testing by the two researchers has shown a 99% decrease in bacteria growth on and around implants after 24 hours and an infection-free environment after 48 hours.  These researchers hope that the widespread application of their system could result in a milestone achievement in the fight against infection.", "Whilst the R&D required to apply this technology would be a lengthy and costly process, there are a number of applications of nanotechnology available today that may also reduce infection in total joint replacement.
