The Vasto Learning Functions are 100% enmeshed in the platform, they form a part of the fabric of the software because learning management and student management are part of the same thing.\u00a0 When an LMS and an SMS are separate, it suggests that the learning activities are separate from the communication, planning, discussion and certification tasks.\u00a0 At Vasto, we believe the student journey should be a seamless experience across all the activities requires to reach qualification/certification, with communication between students, assessors and administrators active along the path. All the data (every keystroke) is tracked so educators can assist students regardless of whether they are in an online learning environment, attending a prac or just needing clarification from an assessor for a question or an administrator for other information.", "Head Office", "Level 1, 50 Yeo Street", " Neutral Bay  NSW  2089", "Office Hours", " Mon - Fri : 9am to 5pm (AEST)", "About Us", "Phone: ", "(02) 9188 9491", " Email us: ", "enquiries@vastosoftware.com.au", "For technical support, please email:", " ", "help@vastosoft.com", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Aug 1, 2019", " | ", "Automation", ", ", "New Features", "Make sure your trainers keep in touch with students between prac sessions.\u00a0 Our updated broadcast tool for trainer messaging means trainers can select ALL or GROUPS of students to message (see pic).\u00a0 Want to remove all paper based assessments from Prac sessions?\u00a0 ", "Contact us", " to learn how our prac checklist manager means your pracc attendance AND activity assessments can all be completed in real time, in class.\u00a0 No more work needed post session!", "\u00a0", "Head Office", "Level 1, 50 Yeo Street", " Neutral Bay  NSW  2089", "Office Hours", " Mon - Fri : 9am to 5pm (AEST)", "About Us", "Phone: ", "(02) 9188 9491", " Email us: ", "enquiries@vastosoftware.com.au", "For technical support, please email:", " ", "help@vastosoft.com", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Oct 9, 2017", " | ", "Automation", ", ", "Certificate", ", ", "Compliance", "Head Office", "Level 1, 50 Yeo Street", " Neutral Bay  NSW  2089", "Office Hours", " Mon - Fri : 9am to 5pm (AEST)", "About Us", "Phone: ", "(02) 9188 9491", " Email us: ", "enquiries@vastosoftware.com.au", "For technical support, please email:", " ", "help@vastosoft.com", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Aug 1, 2019", " | ", "Automation", ", ", "Process", ", ", "Uncategorised", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "May 8, 2019", " | ", "Process", ", ", "Uncategorised", " by ", "Phoebe Hackett", " | ", "Nov 9, 2017", " | ", "Automation", ", ", "Compliance", ", ", "Enrolment", ", ", "Process", "Head Office", "Level 1, 50 Yeo Street", " Neutral Bay  NSW  2089", "Office Hours", " Mon - Fri : 9am to 5pm (AEST)", "About Us", "Phone: ", "(02) 9188 9491", " Email us: ", "enquiries@vastosoftware.com.au", "For technical support, please email:", " ", "help@vastosoft.com", " by ", "Phoebe Hackett", " | ", "Nov 9, 2017", " | ", "Automation", ", ", "Compliance", ", ", "Enrolment", ", ", "Process", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Oct 17, 2017", " | ", "Automation", ", ", "Enrolment", "Head Office", "Level 1, 50 Yeo Street", " Neutral Bay  NSW  2089", "Office Hours", " Mon - Fri : 9am to 5pm (AEST)", "About Us", "Phone: ", "(02) 9188 9491", " Email us: ", "enquiries@vastosoftware.com.au", "For technical support, please email:", " ", "help@vastosoft.com", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Apr 17, 2019", " | ", "New Features", ", ", "Uncategorised", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Apr 9, 2019", " | ", "Uncategorised", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Mar 29, 2019", " | ", "New Features", ", ", "Uncategorised", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Mar 6, 2019", " | ", "Uncategorised", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Mar 4, 2019", " | ", "Uncategorised", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Mar 2, 2019", " | ", "Uncategorised", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Feb 26, 2019", " | ", "Uncategorised", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Feb 24, 2019", " | ", "Uncategorised", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Feb 22, 2019", " | ", "New Features", ", ", "Uncategorised", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Feb 18, 2019", " | ", "Uncategorised", "Head Office", "Level 1, 50 Yeo Street", " Neutral Bay  NSW  2089", "Office Hours", " Mon - Fri : 9am to 5pm (AEST)", "About Us", "Phone: ", "(02) 9188 9491", " Email us: ", "enquiries@vastosoftware.com.au", "For technical support, please email:", " ", "help@vastosoft.com", " by ", "Vasto Tips", " | ", "Sep 20, 2019", " | ", "Automation", ", ", "Uncategorised", "RTO\u2019S that are leading the industry have best of breed systems for continuous improvement.
