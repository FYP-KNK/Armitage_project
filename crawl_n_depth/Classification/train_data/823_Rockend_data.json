In fact, it had nothing to do with real estate but in selling desktop computers.", "If you visit Rockend\u2019s headquarters in St Leonards, New South Wales, you\u2019ll see a vintage Durango F-85, the world\u2019s first integrated desktop computer, pride of place in the boardroom. While it may seem like a relic now, when founder and former CEO Tony Maple-Brown began importing the 20-kilogram machine from the US back in 1979, it was a remarkably forward-thinking move.", "The Durango distribution deal was offered to him while working in the US, after a stint working as a sales engineer in Europe. Hopping on a plane back to Australia, he set up shop at 7 Cable Street, Wollstonecraft, naming the business Rockend after the Gladesville home of his great-great-grandmother, Emily Mary Barton.", "But selling the Durangos weren\u2019t easy. \u201cIn the first year I only sold 20 or so,\u201d Maple-Brown recalls, so the powers that be thought they could do better and took the master distributorship away from me and gave it to someone else. I was still able to buy the equipment, but on slightly less favourable terms.\u201d", "Despite this minor setback, Maple-Brown will eventually win the deal back again, this time determined to streamline the business, fine-tuning it in a way that worked for everyone.", "The first attempt was loading the Durangos with standard accounting software and modifying each unit for customers as diverse as Kennards Hire to Harris Farm Markets, which,\u201cquickly proved to be a bit of a nightmare,\u201d according to Maple-Brown. With these challenges, Maple-Brown then hit on the idea of identifying an industry where he could sell the same software to more than one client, eventually settling on real estate property management software.", "The move proved to be genius when Rockend started to adapt software originally developed for Wang computers and made their first sale to PAL Real Estate in Naremburn in 1980.", "\u201cReal estate agents had to manage other people\u2019s money judiciously, and the nature of property management is that there were a lot of transactions that weren\u2019t worth very much to them in those early days. Somebody would be paying $10 a week rent and they had to keep meticulous records because of trust account legislation, so they had to get efficient.\u201d", "It was a transformative move, and the market was wildly impressed with just how much easier Rockend\u2019s offering made business.", "That innovative drive has stood the business in good stead, building a trusted national presence in a complicated industry where legislation varies wildly state-by-state in order to build a suite of products accessed by north of 50,000 users daily, servicing some 55 percent of Australian rental properties and 40 percent of strata lots.", "A huge part of that success has been derived from savvy acquisitions, like Aussie Made Software in 2009, boosting the strata management user base, but even more important has been the embracing of digital innovation through cloud technology, most notably with Rockend\u2019s ", "Property Tree", " offering.", "That was the brainchild of current CEO Alister Maple-Brown, who took on the day-to-day running of the company in 2012, after an eight-year stewardship by John Goddard that saw offices opened in Melbourne and Brisbane, and annual sales boosted almost fivefold.

If you\u2019ve got clever people around you that can do all the technical stuff, then you can bridge the gap between the customer and the business.\u201d", "The communication aspect was great training, as was the freedom to experiment and innovate offered by that start-up approach.", "The succeeding years will see Maple-Brown junior further expanding his experience in varied sectors \u2013 working for a US-based politician, then a brief stint in a sales role in Rockend, before working in a Silicon Valley start-up at the height of the dotcom bubble.

He also greatly appreciated an environment that revered sales.\u00a0", "However, Alister was unsatisfied by the ungainliness of the suite of desktop client server software he had to deploy around a global network. Turning to salesforce.com in its early days, Alister was able to transform the way he and his colleagues communicated with each other and with their customers. \u201cI shared the account with people that I was working with on the other side of the country and within a day we were all up and running on a piece of software, sharing data, and they could see what I was doing.

There was barely any banking being done online, so to start building it then would have been to go out on a limb, but I knew that it was going to happen eventually.\u201d", "Waiting for his moment, he began building what would become the cloud-based property management tool Property Tree in 2008, after a visit to Xero in New Zealand. \u201cThey\u2019d been operating for about a year and I thought, \u2018Great, there\u2019s the business leading the charge in the online accounting space; now is the right time for us,\u2019 and that was a real validation.\u201d", "Observing MYOB\u2019s rocky path navigating both legacy and innovation, Alister decided it was best to clear the path by creating a new company with a new team unburdened by what had gone before in \u201ca sort of skunkworks environment, with people that had no networks with the mothership\u201d.", "It\u2019s been a transformational ride ever since.

When the money comes into the agency, it comes into their main single trust account. Instead of the money going into the hands of the agent, being received by the agent and processed manually, an alternative software design allows that the money never actually comes into the agent; it goes within the system to the landlord, then the software processes and records the activity.\u201d", "But how will this affect agencies specifically in the future? \u201cIt gets complicated because the technology is racing ahead of the regulatory environment,\u201d says McKibbin. \u201cSo much of the regulatory environment that we are working in today was introduced in 2002. So, the question is whether or not what these solutions are doing actually complies with the legislation and that\u2019s a question we\u2019ve asked the Office of Fair Trading.\u201d In short, either the legislation has to catch up to technological and industrial change or the industry has to fumble on in transition while the paper shufflers catch up.\u00a0 \u00a0", "The challenges around trust accounting and its new generation of software will be more keenly felt by the regulators than the industry itself. \u201cThere are questions about the processes of these solutions and the reasons there are some questions is because the workflow is completely foreign to the regulations,\u201d explains McKibbin. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t compliant, similarly it doesn\u2019t mean that they are. This is why we need clarity around these questions.\u201d", "Most software developers are now focusing on adapting their products to evolve with the changes to trust accounting processes, but also to industry change at the legislative level. \u201cThe best way to view the property technology disruption to our industry is to look at the sorts of transactions on which the technology can focus. And if we stratify the total functions across an agency, some functions are repetitive. These high-volume functions, that require minimal human involvement, are a prime target for technology like Artificial Intelligence (AI) to get involved in.\u201d", "By digitising high-volume tasks that require little human interaction and streamlining data entry tasks, the industry will ideally become much more personalised. \u201cThe things that are going to survive are those where there is human to human interaction; transactions or functions that are unique, that a computer currently can\u2019t deliver in a bespoke way to a client. Computers can\u2019t empathise with the client\u2019s circumstances and they can\u2019t communicate in such a way as to have the client understand them.\u201d", "People fear the unknown and at the rapid pace technologies are being developed in real estate, it can be quite unsettling.

These include, but are not limited, reforms surrounding the licensing of Strata Managers, new rules and regulations surrounding short term rentals, Community Scheme reforms and amendments to the Conveyancing Act in relation to new developments and off the plan sales. It was also noted that next year will be the 5 year anniversary of the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 and as such this act will be due for its 5 yearly review. The Department of Fair Trading is also looking at further legislative changes to make it easier to carry out energy efficient upgrades in Strata Schemes and will also be reviewing the rules and regulations surrounding combustible cladding.

A big takeaway from these presentations was the sentiment that many owners and residents in Strata Schemes simply don\u2019t understand the way Strata and Owners Corporations function. There is a growing need to both simplify Strata and to increase the education available to the general public about the way that Owners Corporations function to ensure that people living in Strata Schemes understand the way that they function.

", "\u201cThe Microsoft Ignite conference is the annual developer event for all those who work with Microsoft platforms. Rockend and Property Tree uses a lot of Microsoft technologies, both desktop and server as well as the Microsoft azure platform. The purpose for attending was to ensure we keep up to date with the latest trends with the Microsoft platforms, speak with some of the keynote speakers and to do some further investigation into the best way to use this technology.\u201d", "What were the key themes of the conference?", "\u201cThere were some big emerging themes, Azure is now a part of Microsoft so there was a lot of discussion on what\u2019s happening with that platform. There was a lot of talk about the Internet of Things (IoT) and best developer practices. One particularly interesting topic was the emerging technology of Cognitive Science. This new technology can analyse someone\u2019s video or blog and work out the context of the blog and whether the writer was happy or sad and what the blog was about.\u201d", "Is Cognitive Science a part of Artificial Intelligence? It's another big buzz word which has been thrown around the tech industry for a while now", "\u201cIt\u2019s applying artificial intelligence to the spoken word or even voice and video. There\u2019s API\u2019s that can look at a video of someone walking and tell you if they are angry or joyful, and if they\u2019ve ever seen the person before - tell you who they are. Scott Guthrie, the main Keynote Speaker, the Head of Cloud at Micorsoft, demonstrated this technology by hooking up our live conference Twitter feed to one of these API\u2019s so that as people were sending Tweets you could tell whether the tweet of positive or negative and if it positive we could automatically reply or if it was negative you could send it through to escalation. This type of technology can be built in 10 minutes and with the example of the Twitter feed, this API will have huge impacts of corporate social media monitoring.\u201d", "You also mentioned the IoT, which is another buzzword at the moment, what was said about this topic and what developments can we see in the near future?", "\u201cThe Internet of Things is rapidly expanding as more devices are connected to the internet. The IoT refers to the interconnectivity of physical devices. An example of the IoT interconnectivity is switching on your household lights from a smart phone. The IoT has been around for quite sometime, but what it\u2019s really about now is large scale data, if you have to encapsulate it into one thing. It\u2019s about your toaster, your fridge and all your things at home sending data. It\u2019s all about managing big data and the communications which has to happen to make this work. There\u2019s a lot of really exciting things which are happening in that space.\u201d", "Who were some of the keynote speakers at the conference?", "The primary Key Note speaker was Scott Guthrie, he is Microsoft\u2019s most experienced engineer he\u2019s been around for a long time, he wrote the dot.net framework and now runs cloud globally for Microsoft, he\u2019s a very impressive person. His keynote was about the division of Microsoft in the future and where they are going and all the exciting things they are working on.\u201d", "So what is happening with Microsoft in the future, where is that heading?", "\u201cThe big take away from me is that Microsoft is now double the size of their competitors combined. They have been playing catch up with their competitors for many years now but they are now twice the size of Amazon and Google combined and growing at a massive rate, investing billions of dollars of development into their platforms. The Rockend PropertyTree application sits on the Azure platform and we want to make sure that our objectives are aligned with theirs. We get best benefit and our customers get best benefit out of the platform when we use the platform to it\u2019s full potential.\u201d", "What can you bring back to Rockend from this conference?", "\u201cLearning about the full capabilities of the Azure Platform and how we can utalise this at Rockend. Up until now PropertyTree has only used a small part of the Azure platform, and we can now embrace it 100%. By using all of the features we can accelerate our time to market with new features, that\u2019s probably the most exciting thing I brought back from the conference.\u201d", " hbspt.cta._relativeUrls=true;hbspt.cta.load(3479088, '16f7e625-33b4-4511-aced-5e83c5c3d3f2', {}); ", "Make the change to Rockend today and discover the Rockend difference.

As a long-term investment, real estate poses a challenge in being an illiquid asset in times of a recession, not to mention its value becoming volatile.\u00a0", "The real estate market isn\u2019t always going to be favourable all the time and so it is important for any landlord to understand the liquidity risk that comes from investing and then leasing out properties and the methods they can use to mitigate these risks and reduce the negative impact it can have on the property investment.\u00a0", "Liquidity risk is the risk that a business or individual will have inadequate cash flow and/or working capital to satisfy ongoing expenses, pay creditors and lenders, maintain capital facilities in proper working order, and so on. In terms of real estate investment, this happens when owners become unable to properly maintain their properties because of lack of funds, resulting in tenants relocating. Another scenario is when the investment itself \u2013 the property \u2013 becomes difficult to sell quickly enough that investors will be holding to it for a longer period than expected or sell at a lower value just to attract buyers.\u00a0", "Mitigating liquidity risk in a property investment basically comes down to minimizing debt and other unpredictable costs to maintain a healthy cash flow.

By researching critical factors that comes with your investment, not only are you able to make better decisions, you can also reduce unpleasant surprises and device a systematic plan once it arises.", "A basic market analysis is a standard when you are thinking of investing in properties and helps answer critical elements that make up your expected ROI and the investment's accompanying risks. This will help you gauge the direction you should be taking. What locations are most profitable? How much do leases go for in the area? What are the vacancy rates of competing properties? These are just some questions you should be asking before investing. You\u2019ll also find that market data is oftentimes ready and available, online or otherwise, and in cases where it isn\u2019t, you can always talk to a real estate agent and property manager to gain some knowledge.", "Every investor worth their salt will tell you that diversification is key to maximizing your earnings for the least amount of risk. Real estate investments can be diversified in many ways \u2013 through number of properties owned, types and location of the properties. However, because of the value of real estate, diversification can be quite a challenge in practice though not entirely impossible. If you\u2019re an individual investor, consider teaming up with other investors or investing through property trusts, syndicates and fractional investments. These investment alternatives are a great way to diversify your portfolio across different property types and geographic locations without having to outlay large amounts of capital or accumulate debt that comes from directly purchasing a property, hence minimizing your risk.", "It should be common sense to insure an investment as valuable as real estate. Disasters can happen at anytime and insurance can help you minimize the loss that can result from such events. In essence, insurance protects you from being financially crippled in the process of recovering from such loss and helps maintain the solvency of your business.", "A general home insurance is good but additional policies can be taken into consideration to help protect your investment thoroughly. For example, there\u2019s landlord insurance which assumes the potential risks that can be incurred by tenants. Your property\u2019s location also dictates which coverage is right for your situation and you might want to consider getting flood, fire or storm damage insurance if the area is prone to such disasters. Additionally, a business interruption insurance can help you cover the loss of income from your property should it befall an unfortunate event.", "Contracts that you have to undergo to maintain your property are also another area you can look into to minimize your liquidity risk. Consider risk transfer provisions or indemnity clauses that assign responsibility and financial consequences to the other party hired to control the risk exposure, provided that the counter party is willing, of course. For example, a contract with a roofing company can include an indemnity clause that covers losses incurred from a faulty installation. By shifting risks, you minimize cost spent on damages or losses resulting from faulty products and services.", "Protecting your investment from future price fluctuations and other contingencies by hedging is a good practice to prevent surprises in future events. A simple way to do this is by setting up a reserve fund. This way you'll have cash available that will otherwise be harder to raise when times are tough.", "All investments have risks but with these risk mitigating strategies, you can limit your exposure or avoid liquidity risk altogether.

", "A study conducted in 2015 by realestate.com.au found that 78% of consumers were accessing property listings and information online using mobile devices and laptops.", " Technology has provided myriad new opportunities for agencies to market services and properties to a broader audience using digital platforms and online listings.", "Many companies have chosen to move with consumers: shifting their focus to list properties on their own websites and real estate portals, utilising social media platforms in a client-friendly way, and engaging personalised targeted marketing techniques. ", "Mobile content and marketing is one of the biggest targets for agencies, with around 80% of Australians consuming information using devices that fit in their pockets.", " Optimising websites and delivering advertising that is mobile-friendly can do wonders for a marketing campaign.", "Real estate is a paper-heavy industry. For most businesses, electronic document management systems are either already in place or in the process of being completed.

In an industry like real estate, with its unique requirements, software company Rockend has made specialist accounting software for a long time, with REST Professional. More recently, it has moved into the cloud with PropertyTree.", "Processes surrounding contact databases and recording or accessing client information have also been remodelled. ", "Agents can now capture contact details of potential clients using smartphones, set up regular automated messages advising clients of new properties on the market, and send clients a text when their lease application or price offer has been processed.", "\u00a0", "The real estate industry revolves around people, and innovations in technology have created\u00a0opportunities for greater communication between agencies and clients. ", "Where in the past agents may have spent time playing phone tag with potential clients or having face-to-face meetings, many now use email or online contact forms as their first port of call and primary form of communication.", " In turn, clients are finding it easier to access information about listings, specific offices and contact details for particular agents.", "Online listings have also helped streamline the communication process. ", "If a listing is effectively detailed and contains great imagery, potential buyers won\u2019t need to contact agents with initial questions about the property \u2013 their first contact will likely be to arrange a viewing.", " Clients can do their own research \u2013 from viewing the original listing to looking at a satellite view on Google Maps, to searching for past sale or rental prices of the property. Agents have an opportunity to steer clients in the right direction, use their insider knowledge of the local market and specific property to pass on further information, and close the sale.", "Not only do new technology and digital advancements mean that agencies can remain in close contact easier with clients, it also means that they can present information to potential clients in new ways. ", "Digital consumers are leaning towards video content, with a 2015 Nielsen report stating that at least 55% of all Australians \u2013 and around 73% of 16- to 24-year-olds \u2013 are choosing to view online video content over regular broadcast television.", "Embracing and trialling new technologies can give agencies an advantage over competitors and help listings stand out to clients. Video content, like visual walk-throughs of properties, can be used effectively on property listings, adding an extra element to the portfolio. ", "Video advertising is also on the rise, particularly on social media platforms like YouTube and Facebook, where consumers are much more likely to hit play.\u00a0", "Technology has revolutionised the way agencies and their clients can operate and communicate.
