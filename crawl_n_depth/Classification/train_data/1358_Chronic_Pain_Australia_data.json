Some of the most common self-reported triggers are stress, menstruation, visual and audible disturbances, hunger/fasting, odours/smells and too little or too much sleep. Of these, the duration of sleep has been relatively less explored than most.My name is Dominic Beer and I am currently undertaking a research project as a requirement of my 4th year Honours program in Psychology at Griffith University (Queensland) under the supervision of Professor Paul Martin, an experienced headache researcher. The project is examining the effect of too little or too much sleep as a precipitant for the onset of headaches. If you are a headache sufferer, it would be helpful if you would consider participating in this study. Our aim is to publish this study so that the information can be used to guide treatment strategies for all headache sufferers.Participants in the study will be asked to complete a simple pen and paper sleep diary each day for up to 8 weeks. The diary and postage-paid return envelopes will be provided to all participants. You will just be required to place a cross in the corresponding boxes to answer the questions and completing this should take around 3 minutes each day. No writing involved! Each participant will be provided with feedback and results in relation to his/her personal data.

However, here are a few of the early findings.", "1. The internet is an important way of obtaining information about chronic pain", "Most (93%) of the people who did the survey said websites were one of the main ways they got information about chronic pain. This compares to 57% who said they got information from their doctor and 46% who said they got information from books.", "Most people said they used websites to read information about chronic pain in general, to find information about treatments, and to find information about pain medications. Most (77%) thought websites about chronic pain were helpful, although 22% were not sure. 88% of people would like to see more people using websites with regards to chronic pain.", "2. Facebook was the most used \u2018social media platform\u2019", "By \u2018social media\u2019 we mean interactive online sites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and blogs. The most commonly used type of social media was Facebook \u2013 69% of the people who did the survey used Facebook, followed by YouTube (34%) and Google+ (30%).", "People used social media differently to websites, probably because social media allows them to share information and communicate with others. Of the 154 people who said they used social media, 47% said they used it to find information about chronic pain, pain medications and/or treatments and 71% said they use social media to find out about other s\u2019 experiences of chronic pain. People also used social media to share information about chronic pain (46%), to meet others living with chronic pain (42%), and to raise awareness about chronic pain (40%).", "Less people found social media helpful, when compared to what people said about websites \u2013 61% of those who used social media said they found it helpful, with 35% undecided.", "3. Less people use Smartphone or tablet apps", "Ninety-three people (52%) who did the survey had either a Smartphone or a tablet, such as an iPad. 23% of these people used a chronic pain app on their phone or tablet. Of those who did use this kind of app, twelve used the app on a weekly basis, which is only 1% of all the people who did the survey. This is compared to 95% of people who used websites on a weekly basis and 74% who used social media on a weekly basis. This suggests that, at the moment at least, apps are not used by many people with chronic pain. However, this may change as apps become better known and more people own Smartphones or tablets.", "These are just some of the findings that are coming out of the study.

A person who may benefit from the use of any legal & appropriate medicine can experience many barriers - their health care providers should not be one of them.", "As with many treatment options available for chronic pain management, price is a significant issue with the potential use of medicinal cannabis. As the evidence for this treatment option is consolidated, health care funders need to assess these medicines for cost-effectiveness (against quality of life, productivity, reduction in cost of other pain management options used) and ensure that people who do find a benefit from the use of these medicines (either as sole pain relief or in reducing overall medicine burden for an individual) are not financially disadvantaged.", "Further information", "Further information about the Medicinal Cannabis legislation and regulation in Australia is available from the Therapeutic Goods Administration", "https://www.tga.gov.au/medicinal-cannabis-guidance-documents", "Learning how to manage pain is a process that involves change.
