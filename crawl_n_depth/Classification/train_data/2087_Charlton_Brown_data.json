Sharing is something that children need to learn in order to make (and keep) friends while playing cooperatively. Ultimately,\u00a0 once a child starts having playdates and going to child care, they\u2019ll need to be able to share with others.", "Most importantly, sharing teaches children about fairness, as they learn that if they give a little to someone else, they can still get some of what they want as well. Children who share also learn important life skills like how to take turns and negotiate, and how to deal with occasional disappointment.", "Unsurprisingly, children learn a lot from watching what adults do. When you model good sharing and turn-taking, it gives children a good example to follow. It\u2019s also a good idea to point out good sharing in others, and when you see a child trying to share or take turns, make sure you give lots of praise. \u00a0Another good idea is to play games with children that involve sharing and taking turns.

You share with me, and I\u2019ll share these with you.\u201d", "Before heading to child care or playdates, talk to your child about sharing beforehand.

Why don\u2019t you ask him what he wants to play with?\u201d At the same time, children are allowed to have special toys that they don\u2019t want to share. Find out what these are and help them to put these away before another child arrives.", "If a child doesn\u2019t share well, you can do some practice together, away from other children, to get them used to the idea. Food is a good way to start. Try sharing a meal and offering some of your food and exchanging it for some of theirs. Don\u2019t avoid playdates or taking a child to childcare if they have trouble sharing. Just use them as an opportunity for practice and stay nearby to provide encouragement and praise. When they do learn to share, make sure to let them know exactly how proud you are of them.", "For children over three years of age, it can help to create consequences if they still don\u2019t want to share. These consequences work best when they\u2019re related to the thing that they don\u2019t want to share. For example, if children won\u2019t share a toy, take it off of both children. This way, the consequences feel the same for both children\u00a0 and it gets them thinking about what they need to do if they want to play with the toy together. Once the idea seems it\u2019s sunken in, you can give them the toy back to see if they\u2019ve figured out why sharing is important.", "Sharing ability varies at different age ranges so don\u2019t expect toddlers to be super benevolent.
