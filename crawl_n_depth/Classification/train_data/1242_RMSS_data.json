With the introduction of improved risk and incident/event management, catastrophic events have declined in Australasian mining according to the NSW Department of Industry and Investment, the government body that oversees mining safety in NSW.\u00a0 However, organisations need to maintain a high standard of identification and assessment of hazards and risks that can lead to such events.", "\u00a0", "Today, the majority of organisations manage workplace events on the basis of severity and their impact on business operations.

While this process is essential, when practiced in isolation, it can overlook the potential for events to measure the effectiveness of an organisation\u2019s risk management processes.", "\u201cIn most of these risk assessments the major risk has not been considered, or when it has, it has been determined as low risk as \u2018there hasn\u2019t been such an incident for years\u201dsays Andrew Howarth, CEO, RMSS.", "Mining organisations must move away from a reliance on procedural controls towards a greater focus on engineered risk controls to escalate events on the basis of risk (potential outcome) not just severity (actual outcome). By adopting a risk based approach, organisations can learn from events (a risk that eventuated) and implement a preventative framework to reduce negative events or prevent them from occurring again.", "Organisations that manage events on the basis of risk are turning a reactive situation (the fact that something happened) into a preventative situation and creating a learning organisation. Learning from events is about understanding why the event happened and linking it back to risk management. In order to progress from a reactive approach to events to a preventative approach; it is important to map the event including the relevant causations.", "The organisation must develop a clear process to understand what happened including the major contributing factors. This will allow the organisation to conduct a risk assessment, put a control framework in place, reduce risk and prevent events from occurring again. Some organisations will do a root cause or a fault tree analysis to determine the causations of the event whether it may be to do with fraud, property damage, injury etc.", "If the organisation is able to look at the functional relationship (the types of risks that have been identified across various categories of the organisation) as well as the physical relationship (where the risk is actually occurring) and determine the correlation and relationship between the two, this will help the organisation to introduce risk management and adopt technology better across the organisation.", "The organisation must compare and analyse the difference between where they think their risks are occurring and where they are actually occurring after applying an Enterprise Risk Intelligence (ERI) approach.", "Risk Management is not necessarily an intuitive process; it can be a difficult task to implement organisation wide and a challenge for many organisations. The process is difficult because there are a variety of concepts to assimilate throughout the organisation and a number of pitfalls to avoid. Risk Management must include all of the organisational factors from the top down to ensure that the correct risk, event and compliance safety culture flows from the board room to the mine site and is entrenched between.", "Organisations across a variety of industries are recognising that risks are no longer merely hazards to be avoided, but in many cases, opportunities to be embraced.

Of course, when most clients purchase a commercially available off-the-shelf product; such as the RMSS Suite, they generally prefer to go through an implementation process whereby they take their internal business requirements and existing systems/processes and configure them through a vendor provided implementation project management service delivery.

It's based on a combination of International and Australian standards along side recognised best practices and user group feedback.

This enables innovative and dynamic workflows to coexist for different categories of risk, compliance and enterprise event management.", "The product includes a transaction server that constantly polls and monitors data that is entered into the product through the completely configurable user interface forms and determines the required workflow based on the pre-set parameters of each client; including but not limited to; items as risk scores, control framework status, breaches in treatment plans, overdue activities, incomplete processes, risk occurrences, event severities and potential risk assessments and many more criteria.", "This rich combination of data set monitoring and consequential automated workflow management delivers efficiency and effectiveness like no other product available in the market. Further, the return on investment is as fast as it possibly could be from the purchase of an off the shelf software program.", "Importantly, it is not expected that all clients will have every detail of their Risk, Compliance, and Enterprise Event Management processes strongly embedded in the knowledge bank of the organisation and its employees. This is another area where the RMSS Suite is able to provide content which includes terminology, workflow, considerable forms, assessment models and more; all based on existing standards (both International and Australian), legislation, regulations, best practice and over 20 years of user feedback.", "If you have any questions on our product or would like to contact RMSS, you can so by emailing sales@rmss.com.au or calling our Brisbane office on 1300 850 625 or +64 4462 4032 ( our New Zealand Office).", "Thanks for reading!\u00a0", "The RMSS Suite is a commercially available off-the-shelf product, it has the capability to operate and deliver a return on investment from day one via its preconfigured implementation processes based on compliance with major relevant Australian and International standards. For example, the RMSS Risk Management product; ", "risk", "manager, is based on ISO 30,001.This means that where clients are less mature in their Risk Management framework, they can adopt a technology platform such as the RMSS Suite as an existing product that will deliver compliant workflows, terminology and processes from day one.", "\u00a0", "The advantage extends to both Compliance and Enterprise Event Management processes where compliance obligations and audits can be managed from existing libraries and Enterprise Events; or risk occurrences, can be recorded and managed based off existing off-the-shelf forms and processes. Of course, when most clients purchase a commercially available off-the-shelf product; such as the RMSS Suite, they generally prefer to go through an implementation process whereby they take their internal business requirements and existing systems/processes and configure them through a vendor provided implementation project management service delivery. This process makes changes to the existing off-the-shelf workflow and configuration to meet the individual client requirements such as terminology, escalation, notification, forms, that already exist within the client organisation. The advantage of this is that the existing knowledge bank already built and invested in within the\u00a0client organisation and its personnel does not need to be changed as the RMSS Suite can map the exact required forms, assessment models, audits, workflows for risk, compliance and event and more. Powerfully and paramount to this process is that the RMSS Suite, unlike most other venders in the GRC market, we allow this to happen through user interfaces and none of the configuration or implementation processes require software engineering which is not only expensive and time-consuming but can result in further software engineering requirements and costs down the road at times such as future upgrades or changes in process.", "RMSS as a business has achieved this capability in its product, the RMSS Suite, by investing significantly in research and development far beyond industry standards and norms to deliver highly configurable user based wizards that allow changes to be made; not just within the major areas of GRC such as risk, compliance and event but within each of the individual categories within each of the three main modules (for example; environment, reputation, finance, project management, Occupational Health & Safety, operations, strategic et cetera).", "The reason this article is titled the advantages and disadvantages of a highly configurable commercially available off-the-shelf product is because when clients remain with the same vendor for a long period of time; for example RMSS has many clients that have been with us for over 15 years; the configurations and implementation processes requested at the commencement of the business relationship may have significantly changed with the maturity and development of the business processes of the client. Add to that the inevitable personnel changes that occur over such a period and the capability and configurability of the product such as the RMSS Suite may be unknown or forgotten with long-term clients. Put simply, the instructions provided to the vendor on the way to implement the product 10 or 15 years ago may be completely different today.", "\u00a0", "Obviously, the responsibility to communicate this capability exists within the product licensed to the client is clearly the responsibility of the software vendor, in this case RMSS. However, it is a challenge to find the most appropriate way to communicate these capabilities and increased functional possibilities that exist within the software product.", "This conundrum or syndrome does not simply exist with products like RMSS it exists with multiple global leaders like Microsoft where most users may only be benefiting from 5 or 10% of the functionality and capability of the software. Users can quite simply be unaware of the capabilities and functionality that exists in the software that they have purchased or leased.", "Our advice is talk to your software vendor, if you\u2019re experiencing times where your product isn\u2019t delivering to your expectations or it requires further additional or changed functionality; your software vendor will, in most cases, be able to support you in delivering the required outcomes. More importantly, in the case of RMSS, this can be achieved without further investment or cost to the client as our licensing model includes the addition of all enhancements that are made under the various releases year upon year and can be changed immediately in a training or transition version of the product by a user with the associated permissions and of course fully supported by RMSS as part of our standard support agreement.", "If you have any questions on our product or would like to contact RMSS, you can so by emailing sales@rmss.com.au or calling our Brisbane office on 1300 850
