Regulatory expectations", "Under CPS/SPS 220 Risk Management, the Board of a financial institution is now responsible for forming a view on risk culture. This can be a challenge for directors given that they don\u2019t have a great deal of opportunity to interact with staff and often have to rely on management views of how things are on the ground. Despite this difficulty, the onus still rests squarely on directors to form an opinion on the organisation\u2019s risk culture and take responsibility for driving any changes that are deemed necessary.", "Regulatory supervisors face the same challenge in trying to form an impression of an organisation\u2019s risk culture.

It\u2019s important to be aware of them and ensure that they are reflective of the overarching values of the organisation.

Hidden consequences", "While the more obvious consequences of poor risk culture have been played out on the front pages of newspapers across the globe, a number of less recognised consequences could be undermining your organisation\u2019s success.", "For instance, a poor risk culture could be derailing your strategic objectives. This could result from lack of staff engagement and drive, or from the public\u2019s lack of trust in your brand.", "Your remuneration practices could also be inadvertently driving your risk culture, rather than rewarding staff for acting in a certain way.

Benefits of knowing your risk culture", "It goes without saying that knowing your organisation\u2019s risk culture puts you in a stronger position, but why is this more than just a regulatory exercise?", "Assessing risk culture allows you to gain greater confidence that your staff will make the right decisions in all situations and that your organisation is supported by a strong ethical framework. Staff will feel confident and comfortable in speaking up and challenging the attitudes and actions that they see.", "This is turn will help to reduce future mistakes. A culture of openness fosters an environment where staff feel comfortable talking about errors that have been made in order to learn from them and avoid them in the future.", "Additionally, it promotes sound risk taking. Risk management is not all about the minimisation of risk; risk taking can be increased if it\u2019s in line with appetite and strategy. Promoting risk management throughout the organisation that is supported by a strong risk culture will also help to ensure that staff are thinking ahead to emerging risks, or identifying or challenging risk-taking activities that they think are outside the institution\u2019s risk appetite. It\u2019s not enough for staff to know what is inside or outside of the Board\u2019s risk appetite, but to feel empowered and motivated to escalate and address these concerns as well.
