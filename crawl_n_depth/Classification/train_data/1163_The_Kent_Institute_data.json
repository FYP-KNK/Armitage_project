To become a young professional, the most important thing is your approach and strong fundamental knowledge. What I\u2019ve learnt while studying for my degree at Kent, I could build on it and grow from there. Kent has many great teachers who have real world experience in what they are teaching. I have had many teachers that I enjoyed listened to, simply because they were so knowledgeable at what they were teaching. Many of them would share experiences from their industry careers, giving us real world insights, and encouraging us to keep up to date with news and make discussions on current topics. It has been overall a great learning experience rather than just learning from books.", "\u00a0", "Moreover, the support I received from some teachers was unbelievable.

I mean support way beyond that \u2013 the personal approach, advice and help. When I had a goal to complete an internship in finance and discussed it at Kent, in addition to feedback on various companies and their internship programs, reference letter, consultations, I also received very personalized help in the form of direct industry contacts where I obtained valuable insights. This helped me to choose the right companies to apply for and finally to pick the one that has allowed me to get hands-on experience and gain an exposure to many areas in financial markets, while treating me like a family from day one. I can say this would not happen without the help and connections I got from my teachers. It isn\u2019t something you would receive at a big university, and that\u2019s why I think studying at Kent made such a big difference for me. ", "\u00a0", "5.

The first was to be able to gain a qualification that would advance my career. Although the course I study is also available in Nigeria (my home country), I believe international education was a better option to be able to gain superior knowledge in both personal and professional development. The second reason was the amount of opportunities I believed Australia holds for me in my chosen career.

However, I am still very passionate about Nigeria and would like to make an impact back home. I believe that the more I learn in Australia, the greater my knowledge will be to help me start my own business when I return to my home country. Because it is such a developing country, we can learn many things from a country such as Australia.
