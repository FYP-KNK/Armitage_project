So whether you're a complete beginner or think you should be on the world tour, get amongst it and take advantage of the Gold Coast's awesome waves! Don't have a board? Pick up a cheap deal on Gumtree or hire one for a small cost. It's an awesome way to spend the day and you'll have so much fun!", "3. The Gold Coast is home to some amazing natural attractions you HAVE to explore! Currumbin Rock Pools, Springbrook National Park, Mount Warning, Mount Tambourine, Burleigh Heads National Park. Why not take yourself exploring for the day and head to one of these awesome spots! All these places offer great hiking trails where you'll come across beautiful views and amazing natural features like waterfalls and rock pools. And you know it...the best part is it is FREE!", "4. Markets! There are so many markets on the Gold Coast! The Surfers Paradise Beachfront Markets on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday nights, the Carrara Markets on Saturdays and Sundays, the Village Markets every first and third Sunday at Burleigh Heads and every fourth Sunday at Paradise Point, and my absolute favourite, the Miami Marketta.

Including that world famous surf town, Byron Bay. Only an hour south of the Gold Coast, Byron Bay is the perfect place to road trip to, and is easy to do on a budget. Stay at one of the many friendly backpackers or pitch a tent at one of the camping grounds, and spend a weekend exploring Byron's gorgeous beaches, surfing, and checking out the cool little hippie town. As the sun sets enjoy a few pints at the famous Beach Hotel and then head to Cheeky Monkeys for a cheeky dance on the tables.
