We consider ourselves and our girls incredibly lucky to have got places at Explore and Develop when we did \u2013 we have never had any regrets.", " I have taken for granted the strong relationship that I have with Charlene and her team at Explore & Develop, it is only when I speak to other mums with kids at other daycare centres that I realise that having such great relationships with the staff is not the norm.  I love the clean, spacious, bright and nurturing  environment that Explore & Develop provides, not just for the children but for the whole family. The low staff turnover means both our girls are really comfortable with all the staff and have known most of them for the whole time they have been at Explore & Develop. When my youngest Bessie started daycare she often came home smelling of perfume which gave me great comfort knowing she was held and hugged when she was feeling upset \u2013 she now walks into the baby room full of confidence and waves goodbye to me!", " Charlene goes above and beyond in her efforts to integrate family with childcare creating a community environment for all involved, some examples include Christmas markets, summer picnics, experts coming in to talk about children behaviour/nutrition we also get regular emails about up and coming parenting seminars in the local area.", " The team at Explore & Develop treats each child as an individual and helps them reach their full potential; we appreciate the care and guidance the staff has shown to our girls.", " Our family are extremely happy with Explore & Develop Brookvale, i cant praise it enough!", "Just a note to let you know how happy we are with Explore & Develop Brookvale.  I was initially hesitant about sending Charlie to daycare but honestly could not have been more pleasantly surprised.  It has made the transition for him an absolute breeze.  He loves his kindy days and we are constantly impressed with the range of activities for him to engage in and the care and support from both Charlene and all the excellent teachers in the Bilbies room.", " The daily photos and explanations of what the children are up to is a huge comfort to us as parents, seeing what they are up to each day and we are so grateful for the generous, gentle, loving, caring nature of everyone we\u2019ve dealt with.", " I cannot speak highly enough of this wonderful centre and I tell everyone of the fantastic experience we are having with Charlie at your centre and how we feel so very lucky to have found such a fantastic environment for Charlie to be in each week.", " Thank you, thank you, thank you!", "It\u2019s a big decision finding the right day care for your child. I know for me it was. I have high standards and wanted to find a second home for my precious child. Without family around and having to work full time it was important I found that special place. I was recommended Explore & Develop by another mum & child care worker on Facebook and I hit the jackpot when I found the Brookvale centre! At first I hesitated moving from a centre with a backyard, but now I can\u2019t imagine being anywhere else! This centre offers so much more on every level and the outdoor area is brilliant and ever-evolving. My child leaves for school next year and I just wish he could stay at Charlene\u2019s centre til high school!! It\u2019s not only the community feel and small centre that\u2019s appealing, it\u2019s the reassurance knowing you have an onsite director and owner who puts her heart and soul into the centre \u2013 down to the amazing indoor and outdoor play equipment, the activity based learning, the education standards, the incursions, to the high quality food served and most importantly, the outstanding, caring and engaging teaching staff \u2013 it\u2019s no wonder the staff never leave! It\u2019s all about the little things and Explore & Develop Brookvale has it. And at the end of the day you can tell how wonderful the centre is by the smiles on the children\u2019s faces, they\u2019re content and love being there \u2013 my child included. I could go on, so please feel free to contact me via Charlene and I will gladly vouch my words for those that are seeking reassurance.", "From day one, we absolutely loved this centre. Charlene, the centre\u2019s owner and Director, is amazing! Working tirelessly to make sure everything is managed and maintained to the highest standard \u2013 while ensuring a wonderfully warm, welcoming and family-focussed environment. This centre is truly unique. Our boys have always been encouraged to explore and participate freely, invited to test their own boundaries and limits, and are provided with a wealth of the most exciting and creative learning opportunities on a daily basis! The staff at the centre demonstrate amazing patience and love for our boys.  It is so wonderful knowing that when I drop them off in the morning, they will be looked after with nothing but care and kindness, by people they really trust. We feel really lucky to be part of the Explore & Develop family.  Thank you to Charlene and the team!", "I\u2019ve been really happy with the results at Explore & Develop Brookvale. Their balance of educational versus playtime is outstanding and their contribution to my  son\u2019s development over the last few years has been significant.

Have you ever stopped to ask yourself if you would tolerate being told to go to the toilet on someone else\u2019s agenda? We often hear educators negotiating the times they will take their lunch breaks based on whether they are feeling hungry or not, and I\u2019m certain most adults make decisions about rest and sleep by tuning into the cues of their body and not by looking at the clock. Yet with children we make assumptions that they are not capable of making these decisions, that it\u2019s our job to decide on their behalf because we know more, or know better. We would question \u2018do we know better?\u2019 And if we do, at what point do we trust children to make these choices for themselves?

Essentially we support the underlying theoretical basis for these ideas, but at the same time we question \u2018what does this really mean?\u2019 What does giving choice to children, and particularly babies, really look like in early childhood practice? And are we capable of this in our environment of group education and care in relation to nappy changing and toileting?", "\u201cTreating others with respect doesn\u2019t just happen, even with the best will in the world: to convey respect means finding the words and gestures which make it felt and convincing\u201d", "Framing choice within a model of mutual respect and decision making, we began to approach routine toileting and nappy changing times with wonder instead of absolute knowing. By doing this, we lessened the need to control the child and their actions. We were less likely to make assumptions about what the child wanted or needed because we were building our knowledge from the child instead of applying our knowledge to the child. For example, imagine as an educator that you have encountered a child who has had a toileting mishap just as you are about to begin transitioning the group inside. The child\u2019s pants are wet, and they are continuing to play in the environment. In this scenario we could respond in two ways. We may react thoughtlessly and feel the need to quickly control the situation, removing the child from play and collecting their spare clothes for changing, possibly becoming annoyed by the inconvenience of cleaning up, we may rush through this process as quickly as possible. On the other hand, when we respond to what has happened, approaching the situation with wonder and questioning, we open up the possibilities to promote learning and for the child to exercise choice.", "As we help the child to get clean, our dialogue might include phrases such as:", "\u201cI can see you didn\u2019t make it to the toilet this time \u2013 what were doing when you felt the wee coming?\u201d \u2026 \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t want to stop playing?\u201d \u2026 \u201cI know it\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s important to stop and listen to your body.

Would you like me to remind you before or after lunch?\u201d", "Within our project we worked with educators to develop scripts that supported their questioning during nappy changing and toileting. The example scripts created a consistent language amongst educators and encouraged children to make connections between how their body was feeling and what they would like to do next.", "Our philosophy statement affirms that we believe in lifelong learning. Children are not working towards a specific point of competence, and therefore we know that working from a place of mutual respect doesn\u2019t mean that we will never make a choice on behalf of a child. In fact we recognise that sometimes we need others to make choices on our behalf, even as adults! If we turn the tables again, consider a time when you\u2019ve had what we call a \u2018limbic moment\u2019. When you may be tired, run down, unwell, over worked or stressed and your limbic system (the part of your brain controlling your basic emotions and drives) goes all out of whack. Even as adults we need support to make rational and logical decisions at these times and it is no different for children. As a team we now talk about the choice continuum, where the extremes range between the times that a child is making a full choice for themselves and the times where we are making a choice on their behalf using our knowledge of the child and our professional judgement. Even at times where we are making a choice for children we are always explaining what is happening and why. The why is important as we are not only respecting the child\u2019s right to know what is occurring, but we are sharing our thinking with the child as ground work for their later independent decision making.", "As early childhood educators, we work within a highly regulated environment, where we are continually trying to balance the health and safety requirements for children with the value of learning opportunities which we can provide. We question ourselves regularly to critically reflect on this. Is our inclination to restrict children\u2019s routines based on our own fears of possible unknown events occurring? We aim to exceed the Children\u2019s Services Regulations and National Quality Standards so how do we align this with leaving a child in wet clothes who is not ready to get changed? And are we controlling children to try to make a smoother, easier and more predictable schedule for ourselves? We\u2019d argue in the contrary that promoting an over regulated, over scheduled and over protective environment in fact increases stress for both educators and children and limits the possibilities for learning.", "The impact on families has also been powerful. As our mindset was shifted, our conversations with families improved. We were able to (and still do) talk about our approach in a way where families talk openly and more positively about nappy changing, toilet learning and potential mishaps. They\u2019ve come to understand the learning processes that are foundational for children and that creating more opportunities for choice for children does not mean less respect towards adults. These are elements we continue to focus on teaching, knowing this shared decision making is an ongoing process that strengthens trust, confidence and creates a stronger sense of self belief.", "George, S.

We changed our thinking, our language and our approach.", "Multiple dichotomies have emerged for us over this time. To share them with you, we\u2019ve organised our thinking into three parts \u2013 the first in relation to Quality vs Quantity.", "We discovered as part of our research that in early childhood spaces across Australia there seems to be a generalised, unwritten rule that nappies should be changed every 2 hours at a minimum. Upon analysis none of us knew where this came from, or could sufficiently explain why. We asked ourselves, why do we feel like it is our duty to change a child\u2019s nappy even if it doesn\u2019t need changing? And why were we framing these critically important interactions with children within the structure of a set routine guided by the clock. Were we merely ticking boxes to say we had completed a health and safety requirement or were we thinking more deeply about the importance of this interaction for the child/adult relationship and the potential learning that could occur during these moments?", "Degotardi (2010) highlights the problem that educators face under the pressures of compliance and the responsibility of meeting the child\u2019s basic needs without the child\u2019s guardian present. Would families see us as negligent if we delayed children\u2019s change times to meet their individual needs? Some research even suggests that a routine based focus to caregiving times can lead to a decrease in reflective thought processes by the educator and therefore a decrease in the warmth of interactions between the child and adult. In other words, were we just going through the motions by following the clock?", "\u201cWhen care moments are regarded as a chore to be completed rather than an engagement with individual children in unique contexts, it robs children of their individuality and teachers of their agency\u201d", "In actual fact we weren\u2019t going through the motions. We\u2019d worked hard on our connections with each child. Educators were focussed during nappy change times and communication with the children was rich. But we were still focussed on quantity.

As we continued to implement our changes and noticed the impact this had on the children\u2019s learning and understanding about their own bodies, our determination was reinforced.
