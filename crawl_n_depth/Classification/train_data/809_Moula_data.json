A fruitless search for healthy, sugar-free snacks for their kids\u2019 lunches led the pair to co-found Funch in 2014.", "Tanya and Lisa met when their kids were growing up together. A common interest in health and fitness started a friendship that became the foundation for Funch \u2013 a range of healthy pre-mixed all-natural snacks for kids and adults.", "\u201cLisa and I used to go to the same gym at the same time, so we struck up a friendship around that shared interest. Once our kids started going to school together and we started packing lunch boxes ", "every day", ", we both realised how little there was on offer in the way of healthy and tasty snacks in the supermarket. It was almost impossible to find snacks that were actually healthy, low in sugar, had no additives, preservatives, or that didn\u2019t include ingredients we couldn\u2019t understand or pronounce on the back of the packs.\u201d", " So, they decided to make their own. ", "From this initial insight, Tanya and Lisa saw an opportunity to fill the nutritional void. From their own experience, they saw how an interest in exercise can lead to an interest in nutrition and healthy eating. They wanted to make healthy snacks accessible, which meant they needed to be cost-effective, fun for kids to make, and adaptable to account for various allergies and dietary requirements.", "\u201cThe business evolved into making premix products, which we saw as being very similar to a cake mix concept. You simply add two wet ingredients to make up the finished product. It\u2019s quick, it\u2019s easy, it\u2019s convenient but there\u2019s still a level of involvement for the parents and the kids who are making the product. \u00a0I think once people have an increased awareness of their personal health and their family\u2019s health they tend to want to be involved in the process a little bit. Making the product pre-mix instead of ready to eat also meant we could sell them at a lower price point too. If you went to a store to buy protein or bliss balls, they may cost $4 a ball, whereas with our balls, you can make up a pack of 15 at one time and pop them in the fridge and you\u2019re set for the week.\u201d", "When they started out, Tanya and Lisa handmade all the products themselves \u2013 not just pre-mix but ready to eat snacks. They made them, packaged them and hand delivered them. They realised quickly this labour-intensive business model wasn\u2019t viable. So they made time to reflect, take a step back and think about a more strategic business model, and that\u2019s how they landed on the premix model.", "\u201cRather than just going and buying a packet off the shelf, kids or parents are actually involved in the process, which gives them ownership over their health and food. People can customise the recipe to suit their taste too. If you prefer nut butter, or don\u2019t like coconut oil, you can substitute and play around with the recipe. Our snacks tick the box of nude food, and knowing where your food comes from.\u201d", "It took a lot of testing and iterations to land on their final premix recipes. While the products were certainly initially designed for kids, they noticed their products were enjoyed equally by parents, adults, and teenagers. ", "\u201cWhen planning the recipes, there were a couple of things we wanted from the outset. They had to be all-natural ingredients, work with no sugar, and for it to be so simple to make that kids could do it on their own \u2013 so now, you just add two wet ingredients. So there were\u00a0all those things we were testing, and experimenting with the different ingredients and then ultimately we came up with what we thought worked and we took it to one of our local school markets, and it was a good response. So from there, we started to take it more widely. We went to local health food stores, to see if they would be prepared to stock us which they were. And then again this continued to evolve from there and eventually, we started out with a distributor and we\u2019ve continued to grow from there.\u201d", "Tanya\u2019s background in marketing and Lisa\u2019s experience in retail and sales helped fast-track the growth of their new budding company, but the financial side of running a business took some quick on-the-job learning.", "\u201cI\u2019ve worked as a Marketing Manager for various companies, which has come in handy. It\u2019s meant that I\u2019ve been able to be involved with the design, the packaging, the website, and social media \u2013 all that marketing stuff. Lisa\u2019s skills with sales and experience in retail have been fantastic. But we still had to learn a lot \u2013 the production processes and the accounting side of managing a business. So have certainly transferred some good skills into Funch, but we have had to learn more about other aspects of the business.\u201d", "When they set out, Tanya and Lisa had a singular audience in mind \u2013 school kids. They wanted to create snacks that kids would love seeing in their lunch boxes. But they soon realised they had universal appeal and the parents and adults buying them were enjoying them as much as the kids.", "\u201cWhen we developed the product originally, we definitely had kids\u2019 lunch boxes in mind. But the product very quickly evolved to focus on parents and adults who want to eat well. And so it evolved into a selection of products that are suitable for health-conscious parents as well as their kids. Our protein balls and bliss balls are the ideal snacks for when you\u2019re busy at work and you want a bit of energy or a bit of a boost. They\u2019re also perfect for when you get home and you\u2019re desperate for something to eat, but you want to avoid grabbing the chocolate bar, or the chips, or some other unhealthy grab-n-go snack.\u201d", "Tanya and Lisa were both new parents when they started Funch. They experienced the common challenge of trying to juggle the challenges of raising a baby and getting back into the workforce. While they worked part-time, they set about starting Funch to take full control of their work life and breathe even more flexibility into their work-life balance.", "\u201cIt can be quite challenging to find work that\u2019s flexible enough to facilitate raising a family. So I guess that was good motivation to start our own business \u2013 the flexibility was appealing.

I think every school kid should have the opportunity to eat healthy food, not just the ones who theoretically can afford it, so we donate Funch mixes so kids can eat healthily.

Because of that, and because we\u2019re fully self-funded \u2013 we have no investors \u2013 our growth has to be strategic. We can\u2019t do everything we want all at one time, so we prioritise.

We\u2019ll do collaborations with other businesses, which might be a giveaway or an offer or something like that \u2013 it\u2019s finding ways of working smarter that don\u2019t come with the big cost. And in the retail space, it can be very effective for people to taste our products. Obviously, it\u2019s quite expensive to have someone standing in a store and if the products have to go further afield the costs balloons. So we developed a portable tasting kit, that retailers can use to set up their own taste testing station in store \u2013 it\u2019s been fantastic.

Whereas in a small business you end up working across every aspect of the business all at once.

Our clients don\u2019t come to us, we had to set up a sales process and find businesses, organise meetings and really put in a lot of leg work to get them onboard, but it worked. We got a few large businesses onboard and they have monthly orders, which is a steady alternate revenue stream. I was also a finalist in The Telstra Young Business Woman Awards (Victoria) in 2015.

Events always work really well for us. People love going out for experiences and we love hosting those events. So we\u2019ll come up with an idea for an event and use our social media to market the event. We\u2019re able to cover our broad demographic between our social media and our newsletter.

So he agreed to mentor me and in the first 12 months after we started our one-on-ones, I increased the turnover of the business by 300%.

Many of these business owners can be found in your database. For the average mortgage broker, 25% of their clients are small business owners or self-employed sole traders.

In these situations, short-term unsecured business finance can enable your clients to hire more staff to keep up with higher demand.

While they might create a healthy number of invoices for their products and services delivered in December, their customers often suffer cash flow shortages and end up taking more time to settle their accounts. In addition to not having cash flow, some B2B businesses close their doors for a few weeks, so invoices don\u2019t get paid during this period.\u00a0", "According to Xero, January is the worst month for late payments. In January 2018, for example, the average payment time for a 30-day invoice was 39 days. The beginning of the calendar year also is the worst time for cash flow. The majority of businesses experience negative cash flow (more cash going out than coming in) in January and February, unlike all other months when the majority of businesses have positive cash flow.\u00a0", "Additionally, businesses that pay GST quarterly need to make their payment at the end of February just after their cash flow has bottomed out.", "The new year is a time when business owners reflect on their results for the first half of the financial year and make plans to improve and grow. These can include expanding marketing activities, purchasing new tools, machinery and equipment, and hiring and training staff.
