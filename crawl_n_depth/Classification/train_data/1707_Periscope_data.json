Why do you want to implement a compliance management system?", " \u2013 In many cases, systems are implemented to demonstrate that regulatory requirements, standards and protocols have been met. Some clients have also seen compliance as a mechanism to improve the way their business operates, so rather than an activity to react and respond to, they use compliance to make the business better in delivering on its strategy", "\u00a0", "2. Culture and understanding", " \u2013 The way compliance is managed should reflect the organisation\u2019s culture and general level of competence in responding to compliance obligations. It has to be remembered that most staff are not consciously managing compliance obligations on a daily basis so when the annual/semi-annual attestation or declaration arrives, there may not be a clear understanding of requirements that are being responded to, so the focus should be on making it easier for users", "\u00a0", "3. Evidence of compliance", " \u2013 One of the most effective ways to ensure higher levels of understanding of what compliance looks like for accountable officers is by including a field or checklist as to what evidence is typically required to demonstrate compliance. This ensures greater confidence in the responses provided", "\u00a0", "4. Legislation vs obligatio", "n \u2013 This is the primary challenge that many organisations face. In most cases, our clients, have managed compliance at the legislation level and then drop down to the relevant sections of the legislation and import the requirements into the system for response as an obligation. Potentially a similar obligation could be repeated under multiple pieces of legislation. Some clients have chosen to manage compliance at the obligation level so one obligation can be derived from multiple legislative sources. This means the accountable officer in the organisation only has to respond to one obligation to satisfy multiple legislative sources rather than having to sign off on the same obligation multiple time because of the different legislative sources", "\u00a0", "5. Obligation vs business as usual", " \u2013 It is really important not to fall into the trap of detailing every potential obligation that could be required to be responded to. The system becomes large and unwieldy. You can imagine how many lines on a spreadsheet you would create trying to capture all this. The other thing is to determine whether there is value in capturing items which have become business as usual for most organisations such as providing monthly financial reports to the Department of Treasury and Finance. This is business as usual for most Government organisations, so having notifications being generated by the software provides limited value", "\u00a0", "6. Detailed or rolled up obligation ", "\u2013 We have seen times where some clients have broken out legislative requirements down to the individual clauses and sub-clauses. This approach generates many records that need to be managed and the organisation will be held accountable for. It would appear to be better to manage the legislative requirement at the highest level and having an obligation that covers off on several Sections/clauses to minimise the work for accountable officers. Similarly to ensure the system is not overwhelming, consideration needs to be given to whether the capture of obligations from Standards, Codes of Practice and internal policies and guidelines is warranted", "\u00a0", "7. Obligation priority", " \u2013 One of the realities is that most organisations do not treat all obligation are equal, so it is important to set some priority. Most typically priority is reflected in a risk rating, consequence rating, priority and/or whether there is an obligation to report regularly or to report on a breach", "\u00a0", "8. Accountability shared means no accountability", " \u2013 There are times where organisations will deem that an obligation has a shared accountability. In many instances, we see that shared accountability means no accountability. In terms of system structure, the more effective systems reflect single accountability supported by evidence from others who have responsibility, such as delegated officers", "\u00a0", "9. Integrating compliance", " \u2013 The most powerful processes and systems integrate compliance with other organisational governance activities.

Some organisations close the event once the investigation has been completed and corrective actions identified, while other organisations only close the incident report when all corrective actions have been completed. The challenge with the latter approach is that the event can remain open for a considerable period of time, as some corrective actions may have budgetary implications, and funding may not be available for several years, so in essence an event is being reported that is several years old. Also some close out processes can include verification processes to ensure that an event has not been brushed over.", "\u200b", "What lessons have we learned? \u2013 This is the essence of why you have a system but is very rarely done. Each event should be assessed for the lessons that have been learned and this knowledge should be shared to drive continuous improvement and innovation. Quite often we will encourage clients to have a data field and some categorisation to capture this information and then have an automated scheduled report running on a weekly or monthly basis to disseminate this information to relevant staff.
