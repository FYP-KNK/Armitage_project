The negative effects of a front mount boom are many. The machine is traveling continuously in a spray cloud depositing chemical on the underside of the machine, filter bowls, taps, ladder, hoses etc and putting additional load on the chemical filter for the air-conditioner. Spray material drifting back can also contribute to excessive corrosion of machine electrics.

A front mount boom also creates visibility issues when in the transport position.", "Yes, we provide you with the perfect combination of power and economy which results in the Crop Cruisers having the highest power to weight ratio in their class. Machines that are hydrostatically driven are often excessively heavy \u2013 they require higher horsepower, larger fuel and oil tanks which contribute to the additional weight. A hydrostatic drive system takes up a large amount of the engine\u2019s capacity immediately \u2013 combine this with heavier gross weight and it is obvious why these machines require more horsepower. The Crop Cruiser is lighter and has a highly efficient mechanical drive resulting in a lower horsepower requirement and lower fuel consumption.", "Perhaps. You will consume fuel no matter which machine you choose \u2013 however we have received reports that different models will consume significantly more fuel than the Crop Cruiser.

If you have a fuel price of $1.50 per litre, you could save up to $3750 every 100 hours you spray is likely to make fuel consumption an issue for you, and your customers. Another way of calculating fuel consumption savings is to assess the possible term of ownership of the sprayer. If an operator kept his machine for three years and operated for 1000 hours per year, saving 30 lt/hour could amount to approximately 90,000 litres of fuel during the period of ownership.", "Future considerations:", "\u00a0It is also worth considering the importance of fuel consumption at the end of the period of ownership when the trade-in value is paramount \u2013 moreso when the fuel price trend is upward.

Goldacres three dimensional breakaway protects the boom by breaking up, backward and forwards when an obstruction is hit.", "Goldacres booms are contour following which means that the boom follows on the same plane as the sprayer axle \u2013 as the sprayer travels over contours the boom follows. A self leveling boom uses gravity to remain level \u2013 therefore as a sprayer travels over contours, with a self leveling boom, the boom would require adjustment by the operator to prevent ground strike.", "The suspension and construction of the booms are different. The sizes available are also a difference \u2013 the Delta is available in sizes from 12 \u2013 24m and the TriTech is available from 24 \u2013 42m in width. Goldacres suggest the Delta boom for medium size applications.

Ultrasonic boom height leveling is also available on selected models \u2013 with this system a series of sensors, mounted on the boom, electronically control the height of the boom above the ground. This reduces the work required by the operator to maintain boom height.", "This is something that is unique to your property and application. You should not simply choose the biggest boom size available \u2013 you need to consider how practical the boom will be across your terrain and how it matches up with other equipment on your property. The effect of directional changes obviously increases with bigger booms. Wider booms are more prone to application rate variability on the outer sections, and the yaw effect increases exponentially as weight and length increase. When selecting the most suitable boom for the job the objective should be to choose the one which will provide the best chemical placement, resulting in the best chemical performance, not necessarily the boom which will cover the most amount of area in a day.", "Aluminium is lightweight which reduces the overall boom weight and stress on all components as well as improving the boom ride and stability when in operation. The lighter weight reduces the inertial forces on the boom centre section, making it easier to control yaw movement of the boom, reducing over and under application, a major contributor to poor chemical performance. Aluminium also offers an extremely high level of chemical resistance which assists in achieving a long boom life.", "Goldacres cable fold system is an efficient way to fold the outer boom out and in, and also acts as a secondary breakaway system which allows the outer wing to move backward when an obstruction is hit. This greatly reduces damage to the boom compared with a completely rigid fold.", "The Goldacres boom has been designed to provide the best possible boom ride without the use of touchdown wheels as standard. Goldacres offer touchdown wheels as an option if required. Touchdown wheels are set about 150mm above the ground and only touchdown occasionally. They are not set to continually run on the ground.", "Goldacres manufactured a cable suspended boom from 1983 \u2013 1985. These booms were 60ft (18 metres) wide. Their performance was considered satisfactory although the yaw movement generated was somewhat excessive. When the requirement for larger booms eventuated we realised the yaw movement of this suspension system would prohibit further development of this design. At this point the Goldacres developed a controllable yaw dampening system which has now evolved to the current TriTech suspension. The importance of yaw dampening cannot be overstated. A spray boom which is yawing backwards and forwards is over and under applying, defeating the attempts of controlled chemical application. Vertical movement of a spray boom also requires dampening but the consequences on effective spray application are potentially not as great as excessive yaw. A cable suspended boom relies on yaw movement for suspension and when it yaws backward and forward the boom goes up, changing the height of the boom above the target.", "A boom which bounces, sways or yaws deposits chemical unevenly on the target. This can result in weed escapes and may even contribute to resistant weeds. Goldacres booms have been consistently rated the most stable boom in the Australian market by independent testing authorities.", "Goldacres engineers have found that the lightweight aluminium outers and high strength steel centre section and inners is the ultimate blend of weight and strength.", "Yes, nozzle brackets can be adjusted up/down to suit different nozzle types.

The optional Goldacres boom recirculation system RapidFlow is also an efficient method of flushing the boom when cleaning agents are in the main tank and being flushed through the system.", "The RapidFire system provides instantaneous, individual, nozzle shutoff that is controlled by air operated solenoids at each nozzle \u2013 this system replaces the boom valves, and standard check valves, that shutoff the boom sections and nozzles. This provides greater flexibility in changing boom section widths and faster shutoff at the nozzle. Air operated solenoids are inexpensive and low maintenance. The RapidFire system reduces the amount of plumbing on the sprayer and allows for the fitting of a boom recirculation system. The ability to have more boom sections also works perfectly in conjunction with autoboom shut-off systems. The RapidFire system can also be an economical alternative to traditional booms with multiple boom section control valves.", "Air Induction nozzles do allow a larger range of pressures to be used, giving more flexibility of speed changes within one nozzle size. However 3TS is an inexpensive system which still can be very beneficial. The capacity to vary application rates, and speeds, by switching nozzles on and off with 3TS make this a very worthwhile investment. The 3TS system uses 2 x sets of nozzles (either inline or staggered) with an additional control box to operate the 2 tiers. This makes switching from one nozzle type to another very easy.", "RapidFire:", "\u00a0The introduction of RapidFire air operated nozzle switching has simplified dual lines \u2013 we can now offer 3TS on one boom line and also eliminate the need for boom valves.", "3TS can operate as 3 tiers, giving a flow rate from nozzle 1 changing to nozzle 2 then changing to 1 and 2.", "The standard nozzle spacing is 500mm.

RapidFire overcomes these problems by putting the switching capability right at the nozzle.", "Small air lines at each nozzle switch flow the on and off in a fraction of a second, and more evenly across the boom width.
