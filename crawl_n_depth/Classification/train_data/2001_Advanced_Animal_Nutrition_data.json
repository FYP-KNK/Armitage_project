The grasses become harder to digest and the nutrients are less accessible and are generally a poor source of energy and protein. This decline in pasture quality, when not managed correctly, can lead to increasing weight losses as the season continues.", "Most of the digestion occurs in the rumen(firststomach)through the activity of the microbes present in the rumen. To maintain healthy populations of microbes in the rumen, sufficient levels of nitrogen, sulphur and energy are required in the diet. When the pasture is actively growing, the protein content is high enough to maintain the microbe population. As the pasture matures, the protein content declines leading to a decrease in rumen activity and therefore a decrease in feed intake. Mature pasture also contain inadequate levels of nutrients critical to maintaining optimum health and productivity in the animals grazing them. This nutrient imbalance will reduce the animal\u2019s ability to efficiently convert the available dry feed into meat, milk or wool.", "microbial protein. Improved rumen function increases the rate at which digestion occurs, resulting in increased intake. Dry feed intake can increase by 30% to 50% with effective urea supplementation.The aim of urea supplementation is to reduce the rate of weight loss; it does not usually result in weight gain.", "Feeding urea to livestock can be a risky practice if it is not done correctly, as urea toxicity resulting from high consumption can kill livestock. It is not safe or practical to feed a urea and sulfur mix alone to livestock. Loose mixes are a practical option to provide both the nitrogen and nutrients to livestock grazing on poor quality grasses. Loose mixes can also be cheaper per unit protein than blocks and provides the livestock with a constant source of urea for more effective supplementation.", "When introducing urea supplements to cattle, it is important to ensure that any dietary cravings caused by deficiencies are satisfied with a ", "non-toxic", " supplement (general purpose) before the urea supplement is introduced.
