Budgeting", "The biggest reason people struggle with loan repayments is that they don't keep track of their money closely.

If you miss payments, you could have to pay extra fees and end up even more out of pocket.\u00a0", "One way to make sure that you have the money available is to set up reminders in your phone, a digital calendar or a paper calendar to alert you several days before a loan repayment is due, and then the day before the repayment is due, to be sure you don\u2019t forget. And so you can make sure you have sufficient funds in your account.", "To make sure you have that money available to transfer, you should draw up some kind of budget, making sure to include your partner in this if you have one. To create a budget, first work out how much money you have coming in and what dates you normally get paid on. Then work out what expenses you have that you can't live without: rent or mortgage, loan repayments, phone contracts, etc.\u00a0", "Once you know what you earn and what you spend on necessities every month, you can see what you have left over for fun and treats.

Round up your payments", "\u00a0", "If your loan allows you to make bigger payments, you should use that to your advantage. One easy way to do this is to round up each payment you make. Chipping away at your debt a little bit more each month quickly adds up.\u00a0", "\u00a0", "For example, if you have to pay $126.50 every month, setting your repayments to $150 is a relatively small change that could have a big impact in the long term.

It offers benefits both to borrowers and lenders over traditional lending options. Harmoney was the first licensed peer to peer platform in New Zealand and is the largest. It is disappointing that the Commerce Commission is seeking to clarify the legal position, as it affects the entire peer to peer industry, by bringing this case stated action using Harmoney\u2019s operating model as the basis for the judicial review.\u201d", "\u201cI am committed to ensuring that Harmoney complies fully with all laws and regulations. It is highly problematic however when interpretation of each law by government departments results in a lack of clarity as to how the regulatory framework applies overall to p2p platforms.
