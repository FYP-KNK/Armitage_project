And didn\u2019t really lose it, and if I ever did sort of try and go on a diet or something then I didn\u2019t really lose much, and sort of lost interest, so it was only really this year that I succeeded on staying on a diet as such. Yeah I mean it was, it was just it was really gradual over, over my childhood. I don\u2019t really know, you know, when I started noticing that it was an issue for me or something.", "You think it\u2019s an issue maybe about your metabolism, maybe that\u2019s what caused it\u2026?", "Well I can\u2019t think of any other reason than that for if I eat so much less than for instance, my sister, we both do no exercise, and , she\u2019s always been a very thin child and I\u2019ve always been a bigger child. I mean I was, I was more interested in eating when I was younger than her, I loved my food, so did my brother. She wasn\u2019t really interested, she just, it was sort of more of a chore for her, but now, I think she loves it more than me, and I can\u2019t see any other reason why, why there\u2019s that difference, other than perhaps metabolism.", "I mean I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s only my metabolism, I just happened to learn that because perhaps I have a slower metabolism than other people, that I\u2019ve had to eat, I\u2019ve had to eat differently and eat less. Which I wasn\u2019t something I wanted to realise before, so I mean obviously it\u2019s just if you, it\u2019s simple that if you eat more calories than you burn off, you put on weight. Yeah.", "Some of the other factors that people think might be important are things like, maybe you have a genetic predisposition, or\u2026?", "Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I\u2019ve got a, yeah I think that\u2019s definitely an issue for some people. I can\u2019t say it is for me. My Mum was the same size as my sister until she had children and then slightly bigger but she\u2019s very, very slim still for a woman of her age. My Dad was very, very thin until he was in, you know, in his adult years, and now I think he struggles with it a bit too. But I think that I certainly don\u2019t have a genetic disposition towards it, but I think a lot of people do, but then I guess that it\u2019s always the question about whether is it genetics or is it the, the environment that you\u2019ve been raised in, and the environment that you are in. And yeah, I don\u2019t really know.", "And one of the other theories is that, maybe it\u2019s something to do with, what your Mum did when she was pregnant with you, and the kind of things that she fed you when you were a baby, like a very small baby. And that sort of thing, I mean what do you think\u2026?", "Not particularly, \u2018cos I mean I was her third child, and she did everything the same with my pregnancy as she did with my brother and sister\u2019s, and there\u2019s not, I can\u2019t see anything that would explain the variance, and again she treated us, we were all quite young, I mean my brother is six years older than me and my sister\u2019s four years older than me, so she had three kids under the age of 6 at the same time, and she did everything the same for us, so our packed lunch was always the same and so on. Things like that. So I don\u2019t think that I was treated any differently when I was, when I was younger, than my sister was.", "The other thing you mentioned was about, you mentioned it just then as well, about comfort eating. Can you tell me what\u2026?", "Yeah, I mean I\u2019m the kind of person that I want to eat when I\u2019m upset. And I want to eat when I\u2019m bored too. I sort of have both of those which isn\u2019t nice, if I\u2019m in here sitting on my own watching TV I\u2019ll be really sort of tempted to have something, and I guess now what I\u2019ve learnt is that I have to have, I can snack but I should have, you know, an apple, rather than a biscuit and so on. And I guess that as we\u2019ve never really had sort of chocolate and things in my house much anyway, so that\u2019s always been okay, if I want to sort of snack I can just have some fruit or a yogurt or something, and but yeah well, when I\u2019m upset or a bit down I do just want, want to eat something like pasta or mashed potatoes, or something comfort food.", "And is that like everyone gets a bit down sometimes. Has it been just times like that or has it been more sort of specific periods where you\u2019ve been feeling quite low?", "Well, there\u2019s been periods sort of throughout my teenage years, but I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s been a specific one. There\u2019s been quite sort of, there\u2019ve been several sort of periods where I\u2019ve felt less happy yeah, I just think that you don\u2019t really care. You don\u2019t really care about what implications eating will have, and you just, you just eat what you want to - so chocolate or whatever - rather than when you\u2019re not feeling okay, you know, that you don\u2019t want to have that. And I always feel so guilty after I do anyway, which is something I try and remember now, \u2018cause I think I might want it now, but I\u2019ll feel horrible after I do. But yeah, it\u2019s quite hard to have self-restraint when you\u2019re sort of in a low mood.", "And your Mum thought it was dangerous, so tell me a bit more about that. Why is that?", "Well I mean there\u2019s been lots of reports of people being really, really ill from it. Because you\u2019re denying yourself of one whole food group, which can\u2019t ever be good. And also carbohydrates give you energy so you feel really tired and things, which I feel tired a lot of the time anyway, so I didn\u2019t particularly want that on top of everything. And so I mean I cut back on my carbs which was perhaps good, but I didn\u2019t, didn\u2019t last for long and I didn\u2019t do it properly so, yeah.", "And also I mean I always think with diets that you can\u2019t continue forever, that even if you do lose weight you\u2019ll probably put it back on. Which a high percentage of people do do, what I like about the ", "Weight Watchers one is that even though you might stop counting points, you\u2019ve learnt sort of the principles, and that you, you can do that forever, which I have to say just exhausts me when I think about having to diet for ever, but I guess that\u2019s, you know\u2026", "And you were saying about these principles? You\u2019ve learnt the principles. What are those principles?", "Yeah, for instance that you can have certain things that you like but only if you for instance eat less throughout the day, or throughout the week, or, and that you can go out with your friends to a restaurant, but perhaps only have a smaller amount at breakfast and lunch. And then choose carefully at a restaurant, like, no, you know, perhaps choose things without cream or without butter, and things like that, so I mean, yeah. That\u2019s fine, I\u2019ve done a lot of, sort of substitutions as well from the Weight Watcher range like rather than having a full fat yogurt I\u2019ll have a Weight Watchers' yogurt, which is hardly anything off my points that I use for the day. And so on. So things like that have been really helpful as well because I don\u2019t notice the difference between the two different types of yogurts.", "Can you give me any other examples of that kind of thing? The substitutions?", "Yeah, they have like for instance they have chocolate bars which are very small and sort of not really chocolaty at all [laughing], but the fact that you\u2019re having something sweet and, you know, you can have, you can take a bar with you, whatever, does make you much less tempted to have a chocolate bar which is about five times the number of points so it does, they do sort of do some great products that do make a lot of difference. And you, I mean you might notice it a bit, but it hasn\u2019t really affected me to be honest.", "So you were saying you\u2019re just not into exercise really?", "I hate it. I mean everyone talks about this endorphin rush that you\u2019re supposed to get after exercising but I swear I\u2019ve not felt that at all. Just felt tired and exhausted, miserable. I go swimming a bit, which is okay. I just get really bored.", "I used to go to the gym quite a bit, but that had absolutely, and that\u2019s before I was actually losing, trying to diet, I decided to do some exercise, I used to go to the gym about four or five times a week, for a long time actually, and it just didn\u2019t do anything. I mean I had more muscle, but I wasn\u2019t any slimmer or anything like that. I don\u2019t know if that was because I wasn\u2019t doing it properly or because I\u2019d just get bored too quickly and move onto something else, or whatever, but no, I mean exercise has just never been one of the things I like at all.", "But you said you do go swimming a little bit now?", "Yeah, I go swimming, I go on the occasional run, but it\u2019s only a quick run \u2018cause I have an issue with my ankles so I can\u2019t really run for long, which is another reason I hate exercise to be honest. Yeah I\u2019ve just never, never.. always hated it.", "Well they\u2019ve been really, really nice, and it was always nice to sort of, because I\u2019ve sort of been, at first I lost weight, quite suddenly I lost 5lbs in the first week for instance, which was a lot to lose, it was nearly half a stone, you know, so obviously I got loads of really nice comments from my friends, but also, gradually losing weight, and I\u2019m, and because it sort of plateaued out and I\u2019m only losing a bit here and there, and I\u2019d get quite down about it, and think God I\u2019m not losing anything, and sometimes when you feel like that you\u2019re more tempted to say, oh well it doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ll you know I\u2019ll , I\u2019ll you know, sometimes you\u2019re getting quite tempted to give up, not that I would ever, but it\u2019s always nice when you haven\u2019t seen your friends in a while and you come in and they\u2019re, \u201cYou\u2019re looking so skinny!\u201d and that\u2019s really, really nice. \u2018Cos, yeah, they\u2019ve all been really, really supportive, they\u2019ve been lovely.", "And you mentioned you were in a relationship? Are you still in that?", "No, I\u2019m in a different one. Yeah, and it\u2019s very different now to how it was with the other person I was in a relationship with. Because before you know, I was always told it wouldn\u2019t matter how big I was and things like that, which although it\u2019s nice, you know, it\u2019s probably very supportive, it\u2019s also not, not I guess the right response because it just made me feel like I didn\u2019t have to worry about it, and that I didn\u2019t, that even though I was still unhappy about it, it made me feel as though I didn\u2019t have to do anything about it which was probably when I put on the most weight. And now although my boyfriend is really supportive and says that he\u2019ll, he\u2019ll you know, he thinks I\u2019m fine the way I am, he\u2019s also really, really supportive of me losing weight. And you know at times when I\u2019m a bit tempted to have something I probably shouldn\u2019t, he\u2019s quite helpful with that.
