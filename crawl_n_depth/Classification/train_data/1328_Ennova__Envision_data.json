Start and end times generated also may not be the same as a person\u2019s start and end time for payroll (eg you might arrive 15 minutes before your scheduled start from which you will be paid). Timesheets, in contrast, record the quantum of work performed against a specific job/costed activity. They are normally used to drive payroll, as well as job costing and performance reports. Both have distinct roles and, when they are both in use, cross-referencing them is a powerful way to identify errors such as missing timesheets and incorrectly recorded timesheets, and verify actions such as payroll and subcontract payments.", "The approach to capturing time from a contractor\u2019s perspective depends on the contract type and delivery model. Timesheets are generally required for staff, direct workforces, labour hire, and hire plant and labour on day dockets. As an example, if a project\u2019s delivery model is largely subcontract lump sum and schedule of rates, the need for timesheets will likely be basic. However, this may change if a project presents considerable risk exposure to the contractor or client if schedule completion milestones are missed, like on large oil and gas and mining projects where the cost of missed production is high. It\u2019s critical to match timesheet processes, and the level of detail captured, to each project\u2019s contract type and delivery model.", "After a little digging, it\u2019s amazing to see just how many stakeholders are involved in the timesheeting process and/or who typically uses timesheet data.

Timesheets, in contrast, record the quantum of work performed against a specific job/costed activity. They are normally used to drive payroll, as well as job costing and performance reports.

However, this may change if a project presents considerable risk exposure to the contractor or client if schedule completion milestones are missed, like on large oil and gas and mining projects where the cost of missed production is high. It\u2019s critical to match timesheet processes, and the level of detail captured, to each project\u2019s contract type and delivery model.", "After a little digging, it\u2019s amazing to see just how many stakeholders are involved in the timesheeting process and/or who typically uses timesheet data.

Some of the people who influence decisions around technology adoption may not have frontline experience, so we\u2019ve put together this summary of the fundamentals of construction timesheets to help build a baseline of understanding.", "Time clocks and attendance records perform functions like recording when specific people arrive at and leave a site. Depending on the process used, they might record who is on site at all times (ie entry/exit rather than solely clock on/off records). Start and end times generated also may not be the same as a person\u2019s start and end time for payroll (eg you might arrive 15 minutes before your scheduled start from which you will be paid). Timesheets, in contrast, record the quantum of work performed against a specific job/costed activity. They are normally used to drive payroll, as well as job costing and performance reports. Both have distinct roles and, when they are both in use, cross-referencing them is a powerful way to identify errors such as missing timesheets and incorrectly recorded timesheets, and verify actions such as payroll and subcontract payments.", "The approach to capturing time from a contractor\u2019s perspective depends on the contract type and delivery model. Timesheets are generally required for staff, direct workforces, labour hire, and hire plant and labour on day dockets. As an example, if a project\u2019s delivery model is largely subcontract lump sum and schedule of rates, the need for timesheets will likely be basic. However, this may change if a project presents considerable risk exposure to the contractor or client if schedule completion milestones are missed, like on large oil and gas and mining projects where the cost of missed production is high. It\u2019s critical to match timesheet processes, and the level of detail captured, to each project\u2019s contract type and delivery model.", "After a little digging, it\u2019s amazing to see just how many stakeholders are involved in the timesheeting process and/or who typically uses timesheet data. Some of these include:", "With these fundamentals in mind, manual processes present major risks to projects and leak a significant amount of value (either lost time to perform value-adding tasks or avoidable costs etc). Here is the core difference between typical manual processes and digital processes.", "In reality, while the digital process sounds simple, the devil is in the detail. Paper seems very forgiving, with minimal validation rules and a human to interpret records. It is also infinitely flexible as it can be routed through different hands to record and extract data. And it seems easy and fast in the first instance. Successful adoption of a digital process requires solid upfront thinking and a simple, intuitive solution that is fast for all stakeholders to use. Then it can remove the need for duplicate timesheet records held in disconnected systems by those diverse stakeholders. We\u2019ll share more on considerations for selecting digital construction timesheet solutions soon.", "If you\u2019ve moved from manual, paper-based timesheets to digital ones, we\u2019d love to hear about your experiences.

In my experience, the best project outcomes for a new initiative come when there is engagement at both a corporate and project level \u2013 in contributing resources and guiding the direction of an initiative. It is critical to truly understand what\u2019s going to make a difference at the coal face for a project when you\u2019re setting up an initiative. At the other end, you need to ensure corporate goals are incorporated so value is generated not only at the project level, but also the corporate level.", "Having the right people involved in a project can make the difference between success and failure.
