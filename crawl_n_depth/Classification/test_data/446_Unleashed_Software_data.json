It occurs where the supplier has placed some products in the retailer\u2019s control and allows them to sell or use the goods directly from their stock. Only once the product has been consumed or resold by the retailer is the inventory then purchased from the supplier. So while the retailer still incurs costs related to storing and maintaining the stock, they do not have to tie up their capital in purchasing it. In the right situation, consignment inventory can have significant benefits for both the retailer and the supplier.", "One obvious advantage to retailers of holding consignment stock is the opportunity to save on ", "inventory costs", ". In not having to pay the supplier until the goods are sold, the business is able to use this capital on other projects and benefit from the increase in cash flow. The major advantage to the supplier is that they are able to get a product that they believe they can sell in front of end-users, as well as creating additional exposure within their target market.", "Convincing the retailer to stock your products can be difficult where they are unwilling or unable to purchase stock because they don\u2019t want to invest in a risk that may not sell. Consignment stock\u00a0creates a shared risk \u2013 the supplier risks the capital investment that is associated with the stock, while the retailer risks setting aside retail space for the product. This effectively allows suppliers and retailers to \u2018test the waters\u2019 on a product without running the risk of a significant financial loss. It works out better for both parties to figure out what products sell best in which markets before investing more capital into them.", "A benefit for both the retailer and supplier when it comes to consignment inventory is that it generally reduces the lead-time on products. As it is in both the supplier and the retailer\u2019s best interests to keep the inventory at a functioning level, it is usually replaced as soon as it is sold, eliminating any loss of business due to a lag time between goods.", "Consignment stock\u00a0is usually best applied to a particular type of product. Those products that are new and unproven or expensive goods with unknown sales potential are prime examples. It may also be used constructively in the introduction of pre-existing product lines into new sales channels. The outcome is a combination of how confident both the supplier and the retailer are that the product will sell.", "So depending on your business, selling goods by consignment may or may not be an appealing proposition. It can be used for market testing, or as a fairly inexpensive way of finding out if a new product will sell.

But it\u2019s important to count from warehouse to sheet and not the other way round. Why? Because there could be stuff in the warehouse that you didn\u2019t know existed.

Because chances are, you\u2019ll have some reconciling to do.\n", "People often think that finding stock is a good thing. But in reality, it means someone has made a mistake. It\u2019s really important that your stocktaking process includes taking the time to investigate how these mistakes occurred, so you can ensure they don\u2019t happen again.\n", "You should also be rechecking your figures \u2014 maybe even twice \u2014 to ensure that before you hit that big red button to free up your stock, you have a 100% accurate figure.\n", "Finally, don\u2019t shy away from stocktakes.

Although coffee producers bear a large part of this risk, roasters are invariably affected when coffee producers are dealing with an unproductive season. If disease or weather impacts are widespread, the price of green coffee will usually rise even as availability and quality decrease. Poor growing conditions will likely impact on supplier performance. Although you may have placed advance orders with growers, growers and wholesalers are likely to need to balance multiple competing orders in the face of any inventory shortage.", "Many businesses are responding to the risk posed by unstable growing conditions by building redundancy into their supply chains. Smaller roasters who might have favoured coffee from one particular region are increasingly distributing their orders across multiple regions to reduce the risk and severity of disease and weather impacts. Equally, many roasters are adopting a leaner model for both single origin and blend coffees; rather than pre-committing to a particular range of coffees, roasters are making quick procurement decisions and buying what\u2019s well priced and available.

Counting your inventory can be done in different ways. It is important to understand which type of counting system is right for your business when doing a stock take. Inventory can be counted on an annual basis or it can be done through a perpetual counting system. There are a multitude of factors that play into the decision of inventory counting. By breaking it down into the basics, this will provide a clearer idea of which inventory counting system is right for you.", "With cycle counting, inventory is counted perpetually. Since trying to collate inventory is a big undertaking, cycle counting does it in small doses. A small subset of inventory is selected from a specific location and counted on a specific day. For example, if you have a shoe warehouse, one day you might only count running shoes from a particular brand. By utilising this sort of counting method, it allows you to regularly keep tabs on your inventory. With regular assessments you will be able to see how accurate your inventory system is for your business.", "Cycle counting can be very useful in a variety of inventory systems, but it\u2019s more applicable to larger businesses. A large business will generally have a large inventory. It is hard for businesses to close down operations to undergo an annual physical inventory count. A cycle count allows for the business to remain operating as usual with just one subset of inventory being counted at a time.", "The cycle count is beneficial because it minimises disruption in the warehouse. The business can still fulfil orders and re-stock in other areas. Since you don\u2019t have to close down completely, you effectively save money. There is a large opportunity cost and financial cost for closing down a warehouse for an annual physical inventory count. In addition, with cycle counting there is less chance for human error. The cycle counting task is not as lengthy or arduous as an annual count, therefore, employees will be sharper and less fatigued during this process.", "An annual physical count is conducted as one giant stock take. This type of inventory stock take is useful for smaller businesses that do not have big inventories to manage. When an annual physical count is undertaken, all of the stock keeping units (SKU\u2019s) are counted at once. This involves shutting down the warehouse from anything coming in or out and accounting for it all over the course of a day or two.", "There are many benefits of this type of counting scheme. It only happens once and can be done at the end of the year. This means staff members are only distracted by the process for a few days out of the whole year. You can also enter the new year afresh by knowing exactly what you have on hand at the start.

The cycle stock is the inventory expected to be sold based on demand forecasts, while safety stock is extra or buffer stock to meet excess demand, to protect against delayed shipments from your suppliers, or guard against unforeseen problems such as natural disasters.", "Safety stock is typically used when the actual demand exceeds a sales forecast, or if production output is less than planned. In manufacturing, it is important to have raw materials and work-in-progress components on hand to reduce lost labour time. In retail, safety stock is primarily held to avoid the risk of stock-outs and the potential for lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.", "Seasonal supply and demand fluctuations may require companies to hold safety stock at certain times throughout their business cycles. Likewise, any geographic remoteness or the distance of a business from its suppliers could reduce the frequency of deliveries or necessitate longer lead times. Safety stock levels should be driven by analytical data that incorporates such variables as lead times, service levels and fluctuations in supply and/or demand.", "The principal goal of safety stock is to ensure that there is sufficient product available to the customer.", "Safety stock is necessary because in most industries it is impossible to predict with 100% certainty the amount of stock that will be needed, and the amount of stock available, to supply customers over a given period of time. Demand is variable to at least some degree, affected by seasonal effects, one-off \u2018shock\u2019 events, new customers being engaged, or old customers leaving. The best that a business can do is to make forecasts that are as accurate as possible, but ultimately these are just predictions. It is also impossible to fully guarantee an expected level of supply, as suppliers have their own problems in meeting demand requirements, and thus may not always deliver what is needed on time. Due to this uncertainty, having an amount of inventory in reserve can allow a business to weather any difficulties with demand or supply, and keep the customer satisfied.", "Despite the clear need for some degree of safety, it must be emphasised that safety stock comes at a cost. There are many costs to holding inventory, and the more safety stock a business has, the larger these costs will be. Some examples of these costs are the cost of renting storage space, warehouse staff wages, security costs, and the costs of stock becoming dated or obsolete. When added up these costs are significant: the general consensus is that the total cost of holding inventory is between 20-40% of the cost of the stocked merchandise. This is not a one-off outlay, but something that a business must pay every year. Because of this high cost of holding inventory, a business faces a trade-off between safety against demand and supply changes, and minimising inventory costs.", "Faced with this balancing of cost and safety, there are several points a business should consider in determining safety stock levels, regardless of the method used to do this. Firstly, customer satisfaction, while hard to quantify, has a large impact on the success of a business. In the modern world, one unhappy customer for a retail business can mean a large reduction in potential customers, especially if that customer spreads their dissatisfaction through social media.", "In non-retail businesses that only supply a few key clients, relationships are everything, and one or two instances of failure to supply could cost a business a client that may make up a large fraction of their revenue. Second, different industries will face different levels of fluctuation in both demand and supply, and any method of determining safety stock should reflect these differences: the greater the potential fluctuation, the greater the level of safety stock should be.", "Finally, businesses should be aware that specialised inventory software, which can track and calculate safety stock levels, is now available at a fraction of the cost that it used to be. This software can accommodate the various factors involved with supply and demand variability when calculating safety stock levels, and can provide constantly updated data without owners having to take the time to do this manually. Given the difficult trade-off that has to be made, this software is often a worthwhile investment.", "Cycle stock inventory, also referred to as working stock, is the portion of inventory available to meet normal demand during a given period. It is one of the more important chunks of overall inventory because it is the amount of inventory needed to meet customer needs. Your cycle stock inventory is the first place a customer\u2019s order will be fulfilled from.", "Cycle stock inventory is the level of inventory a retailer or manufacturer uses for their standard business cycle to satisfy regular sales orders or sales forecasts. Part of the business\u2019s total on-hand inventory stock, cycle stock replaces older stock items as they are sold.", "Companies can improve demand forecasts by implementing inventory software solutions that use historic data and consider factors such as product lifecycle, ", "seasonality", " and projected trends, to determine accurate cycle stock levels.", "Cycle stock inventory also serves an important role in a company\u2019s accounting records. As a business sells and replenishes its cycle stock inventory, the stock creates cash flow from the revenue it generates and for the payments made. Cycle stock inventory also accounts for a company\u2019s total assets on its balance sheet.", "Cycle stock inventory is equal to the total amount of on-hand inventory minus any goods held as safety stock.", "Calculating safety stock is more challenging than calculating adequate quantities of cycle stock.
