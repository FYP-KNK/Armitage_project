Examining it closely reveals some subtle features that make it a remarkable aeroelastic structure.", "How will it behave as an aeroelastic structure?", "The first clue is how the shaft, though running\u00a0at a constant percentage of chord, is curved. It turns aft toward the tip. It maintains the elliptical planform, but gives a progressive shift aft in centre of pressure moving toward the tip.", "Some built-in twist increases angle of attack (AoA) toward tip (wash-in).

It is truly an aeroelastic system, where aerodynamic loading deflects the structural shape, which changes the aerodynamic forces generated, and in turn affects deflection.", "Since the planform has increasing sweep toward the tip, aerodynamic lift tends to reduce twist, shifting\u00a0from wash-in to\u00a0", "wash-out", "\u00a0under load. This naturally limits ultimate bending moment on the feather: The tip will eventually approach zero AoA at really high relative airspeeds.", "The shaft also curves down slightly toward the tip.

In other words, the static shape happens to lead to a more ideal loaded shape.", "There could be some harmonic considerations involved, where the period of energy storage and release helps improve efficiency. For example, releasing stored energy at the beginning of the up-beat may give a final \u2018flick\u2019 to maximise lift as the wingtip path is reversed into its own wake.", "How does the structural shape help?", "So we have an exquisitely precise elliptical airfoil, with twist and progressive sweep that have obvious aeroelastic effects.

In fact, at this point, thickness is considerably greater than the chordwise dimension. It is taller \u2018up-and-down\u2019 than wide \u2018fore-and-aft\u2019.

Pulling away will make it go down), then one quickly learns to anticipate. The usual response of letting the windward hull rise then bearing away is somewhat modified:", "As pressure increases, the best technique seems to be to ease the sheet a tiny amount, let the boat heel to windward ever so slightly, then pull away as normal. This results in addictive, exhilarating acceleration in total safety. Unlike a displacement cat where forward buoyancy gradually runs out, the foils provide more lift as pressure from the rig increases. The feeling is one of total immunity to nosediving (so far!).", "It is easy enough to become accustomed to just trusting the foils and keeping steering inputs to a minimum. Obviously the boat will spin on a dime when foiling so the key is to be subtle with the tiller.", "Heeling to windward a tiny bit helps to increase ride height when bearing away. This really boosts VMG downwind. Interestingly the same technique works upwind because luffing up to depower helps lower the bow and settle the ride height. But more on upwind foiling later.", "For reasons I do not yet fully understand, Keeping the sail more open works better than strapping the sheet on. Letting the traveler down slightly (say to the hiking strap) and allowing a few degrees of twist causes the boat to fly higher. Closing the leech seems to lock the foils up so the boat settles closer to the water. More investigation is needed here because as speeds rise and the apparent wind goes forward, sheeting in will become necessary.", "My best theory at this stage is that increasing sideforce causes the equilibrium ride height to decrease. This is based on the coupling between leeway and lift built into the L/V foil geometry.", "Another factor may be that, since drag when foiling is so much smaller, it is not necessary to load up the boat with maximum sail CL. Instead the goal is to have the greatest drive force component exploiting fore-and-aft righting moment rather than resistance to heel...", "Sailing downwind with both foils down could lower the crossover speed significantly.", "Having both sides down effectively gives a pair of V foils. The reduction in foil area due to the inboard tips breaching the surface becomes the dominant heave-control mechanism instead of leeway-coupling. This is an advantage because stable foiling becomes possible at small sideforce values. It is important to note that this arrangement is draggy at higher speeds and definitely unstable as soon as sideforce becomes significant.", "Raising the windward foil and relying on leeway-coupling effectively doubles righting moment whilst halving foil area. This is good when sail power is 'excessive' and speeds are very high.", "In lighter winds the leeward foil would have to be bigger (if used alone) for the same takeoff speed. More importantly you would have to sail much higher to generate enough sideforce to fly a hull while trapezing.", "In other words you would have to generate enough sideforce to lift the windward hull and enough speed to takeoff on one foil only. This is achievable at a much lower windspeed upwind than it is downwind. Having both foils down instead allows a very early takeoff while sailing deeper because righting moment is effectively halved and foil lift is doubled.", "I suspect that top level sailors will gradually be able to bring down the critical windspeed for 'downwind windward foil raising'.

Our plan is to see this process through but also test different alternatives in pursuit of the best all-round solution.", "In summary, the S foil and L rudder solution is still thought to have potential.\u00a0", "It is arguably more demanding to exploit fully than a conventional setup but it might be more correct to say that it requires an adaptation in technique and a deeper understanding of foil dynamics than is sufficient on boats where the foils play a less crucial role.\u00a0", "It is vital to understand where the gains lie and work through the solutions without \u2018throwing the baby out with the bathwater\u2019. An objective analysis is the only way to draw meaningful conclusions and make progress.", "Going Forward", "We will continue to tune and test the system on our existing prototype and work to fully understand what makes it tick. We will compare the best version of this concept with other ideas worth testing, then decide what to put into production.", "We\u2019re here to help you build your ideal drone and for any other assistance you may need.", "par\u00b7a\u00b7dox", "\u00a0\u00a0(par-a-dks)", "noun", "1.", "\u00a0A tenet contrary to received opinion.", "2.", "\u00a0A statement that is seemingly contradictory or opposed to common sense but is nonetheless true.", "3.", "\u00a0An assertion that is essentially self-contradictory, though based on a valid deduction from acceptable premises.", "We\u2019re here to help you build your ideal drone and for any other assistance you may need.", "Optimising a system such as a sailboat is a fascinating process. Once the basics are right, picking the best settings for different conditions is an art in its own right. Varying degrees of scientific thinking and 'gut feel' based on experience seem to be called for and an open mind is definitely an advantage.", "Even with very sophisticated tools, the core of the problem is the large number of interconnected variables. As with any endeavour involving the scientific method, all bias toward trying to prove a concept that is arbitrarily appealing must be 'checked at the door' if the results are to be objective. Then data gathered on the water has to be sorted, filtering out extraneous noise, so it can be used to validate the initial predictions.\u00a0", "If done correctly, the discrepancy between observations and predictions will illuminate the designer about where predictions were mistaken.\u00a0", "If the source of the discrepancy can be identified correctly, then the next lot of predictions should be closer to reality.", "Those with an interest in such things will know that arriving at quantitative predictions requires a discipline and constraint quite at odds with the creative thinking process that generates the concepts in the first place.", "To get useful numbers, many assumptions must be made so that each calculation discriminates between only a small subset of variables. Getting the assumptions right is vital and that is where real observations are of great value.", "As the process is repeated, the calculations will get better and more predictive of actual behaviour.", "On a macroscopic scale this process has been going on in design over generations.", "Computational fluid dynamics and tank testing are a great example of how one tool has been vital in honing another to the point where the older one is almost redundant (almost!).", "On a smaller scale, each individual project goes through this cycle. Each boat, once the hull shape, rig design and foil package have been locked in, goes through a process of discovery on the road to delivering its full performance potential.", "Every sailor will know an example of a boat that just seemed to respond to a certain setup that was not the obvious first candidate. A bit more rake, a bit more jib twist,\u00a0traveler\u00a0down a few inches... The winning teams are the ones who accept the observations\u00a0and figure out how they fit in the overall model.", "Complaining that 'it isn't supposed to be faster like that', won't change the reality.", "Just replicating the fast setting without understanding why it works is dangerously limiting since its effect may vary with different conditions so the advantage it confers cannot be relied upon.\u00a0", "Part of what makes our game so engaging is that there is a very stimulating interplay of different forces, at the interface of two fluids, acting on different pieces of equipment that all have multiple dimensions of adjustment. \u00a0", "This post was prompted by the work we are doing now to make sense of the observations we collected when Paradox last competed.", "As explained in the ", "post following the Gosford", " regatta, Paradox first raced with very conservative foil settings.\u00a0", "For the recent regatta we\u00a0dialed\u00a0in maximum toe-in angle, giving the most aggressive lift profile in the fleet.\u00a0", "Now that we have tested the two extremes in the range of this important setting, we can plot how lift and drag interact, giving us an informed guess at where the optimum might be found.", "During the regatta we also tested two different sails from two well known sailmakers. Since Paradox is much more\u00a0forgiving\u00a0than other A Cats, it does not require as much mast rake. With a more upright mast the newer high-clew sails open up an unnecessarily large gap under the foot of the sail and we suspect this leads to significant aerodynamic losses. Once we settled on the lower-clew sail (last day), we replicated known fast settings for diamond tension and spreader rake and obtained a sail shape very similar to other leading boats.\u00a0", "Having eliminated the rig as a variable (with the exception of rake angle which remains an area of investigation) we could be reasonably sure that variations in performance came down to foil settings.\u00a0", "Details of the degrees of adjustment of our foils and their effects on performance will be explored in Part 2.", "This great shot by Karen Parker", "We\u2019re here to help you
