So, when my child doesn't understand, instead of getting really frustrated, fast (although the frustration is real at times) I must remember that perhaps I need to adjust my explanation and be patient. It's not their fault they don't get it, just like it isn't the fault of my students. There are so many other factors that are involved in how and when a student develops. The same is so for your own children but because we are so close to the situation, we often fail to see the bigger picture. So, I always try to be patient with my child.

In the classroom, we plan big performance assessments, but miracles happen in the day to day as we move through moments. It's so important to be present in those moments because they happen so fast and are so meaningful.

It's often hard to admit them, but even harder sometimes to let go of them. If there is one thing I learned from teaching, holding onto mistakes or not reflecting on them is much more detrimental than the mistake itself. We are all human beings and we aren't perfect (even if we want to be), so mistakes happen. Rather than punish\u00a0ourselves\u00a0over and over for them, it's in our best interest to learn from them. Not only does this help us grow as people, but it helps to model a growth mindset for our children, whether they are our biological children or our classroom children. Admittedly, this doesn't come easily for me, but when I do let go of a mistake and try to internalize it for growth, I'm always better for it. Plus, saying you're sorry is another important lesson to model and experience, especially as the adult in these relationships. Adults make mistakes, children make mistakes, but how we deal with them defines us.\u00a0", "Structure is essential while kids are learning.", "\u00a0The routines and structures we put in place for kids help them to feel safe and confident once the structures no longer exist. As a classroom teacher, I was big on routines and clear expectations to guide our learning. It is only in this way that students can feel safe to take the necessary learning risks that will help them grow and stretch. And what's crazy is once the structure is in place, you can begin to deviate. As a parent, having structure is important; the routines for waking, eating, bathing and sleeping will help get your children into a healthy ritual. One thing I implemented when my child was young was a night time routine for bed. It became so ingrained in them, that even now in middle school, they will turn the television off at bedtime and ask me if I'm\u00a0", "reading to them", ". My answer is always yes.\u00a0", "Be consistent.\u00a0", "This one piggy-backs off the last one. Once we have routines in place, we must be consistent in how we enforce expectations. If we decide together what the expectations are and how to be responsible to them, as well as what happens if we aren't, then we MUST adhere to this contract for the sake of consistency and credibility. Yes, there will always be exceptions, but no everything shouldn't be an exception. We create these unwritten rules to keep a sense of responsibility and accountability in the front. Students, as well as children, need to know what the expectations are and what happens if those expectations aren't met. We need to make sure that there is equity in how we carry out enforcement and always make sure we are transparent in the why.\u00a0", "Homemade thank\u00a0you\u2019s\u00a0or notes mean the most.", "\u00a0As a teacher, I used to collect and keep student emails, notes and gifts in my top desk drawer for those days where frustration was getting the better of me and I questioned my will and want to teach. I would simply open the desk and read some of those notes from current and former students and I'd instantly be reminded of why I do what I do. This is true as a mother too. My child has had many\u00a0moments where I melt inside and now that they\u2019re almost a teenager, there are\u00a0moments that test my sanity. If they are having one of the latter\u00a0moments, I reach into my phone for pictures of the special things they have done... short videos or notes they have left me. In fact, I still have a note from when they were about 5 on my refrigerator. I smile whenever I read it (and that's almost every day, multiple times a day).\u00a0", "Being a teacher was really the best training I could have had to be a good mother (aside from the model my own\u00a0mum\u00a0provided - thanks Mum). Much like teaching though, I'm not always the best at it. I do my best every day to let my child be himself and learn on their own. I never want to deny my child the opportunity to learn an important lesson or shelter them from realities that will be in their life. The nuances of doing this well are lessons I'm still learning, but every day I work hard to be better at it.\u00a0", "Report: This post was originally posted ", "here.", "What have you learned from teaching that makes you a better parent?\u00a0", "\n          \n          ", "\n          \n          \n              Comment\n            \n          \n          ", "\n        \n        \n  ", "\n    ", "\n    ", "\n  ", "\n\n", "\n        ", "Designed by a team of experienced\u00a0relief teachers and in consultation with full time teachers, admin staff and\u00a0senior management, ClassCover is changing the way schools\u00a0feel about booking their\u00a0relief teachers.", "info@classcover.com.au", "Australia - 1300 650 442", "New Zealand -\u00a00800 600 102", "\u00a9\u00a02020 Class Cover Pty Ltd.
