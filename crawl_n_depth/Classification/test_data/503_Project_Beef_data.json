Their goal was to make\ndigital libraries work, and their big idea was as follows: in a future world in\nwhich vast collections of books are digitized, people would use a \u201cweb crawler\u201d\nto index the books\u2019 content and analyze the connections between them,\ndetermining any given book\u2019s relevance and usefulness by tracking the number\nand quality of citations from other books.", "The crawler they wound up building was called BackRub, and it was this\nmodern twist on traditional citation analysis that inspired Google\u2019s PageRank\nalgorithms \u2013 the core search technology that makes Google, well, Google.", "Even then, Larry and Sergey envisioned people everywhere being able to\nsearch through all of the world\u2019s books to find the ones they\u2019re looking for.\nWhat they couldn\u2019t have imagined was that one day they would launch a project\nto help make it happen.", "Fast forward to today:", "After more than a decade of evolution, innovation and strong partnerships,\nGoogle Books has helped to make more than 40 million books discoverable, in\nmore than 400 languages.", "And we're not done -- not until all of the books in the world can be found\nby everyone, everywhere, at any time they need them.", "It's the mission that Larry and Sergey set out with as they built Google,\nand one that Google Books would like to continue into the future -- to make the\nworld's information as universally accessible and useful as possible, all the\nwhile respecting publishers, copyright and the role of libraries across the\nglobe.", "If you're a
