Parts are typically tacked by a TIG/GTAW process. K-TIG can be used for this in \u2018TIG\u2019 mode.", "What are the options for tack welding with K-TIG?", "Autogenous tack welds can be performed manually using a TIG/GTAW process. Alternatively, once the pipes or plate are in place, K-TIG can be used to perform either tack welds or a \u2018sealing pass\u2019. For materials which require very high quality purging (such as titanium), a sealing pass can be helpful to ensure an airtight seal prior to performing the full penetration weld. Sealing passes, if required, are typically automated as part of the weld routine, and add only modestly to total weld time. In most cases however, conventional TIG/GTAW tack welds are sufficient.", "Can wire be added?", "Wire can be added to any K-TIG application if required or desirable.", "When is adding wire advantageous?", "Adding wire to a K-TIG weld can be advantageous in the following situations:", "The K-TIG system comes with an integrated wire feeder specifically for these purposes. Where wire is used for any of these reasons, wire consumption will typically be far lower than an equivalent TIG or MIG process, and will generally be reduced by more than 90%.", "The thickness of the wire used can be varied depending on the requirements of the application, and for general purposes 0.9mm or 1.0mm 1/32 inch is typical.

The wire feed and sequencing can be fully automated by the K-TIG controller.", "K-TIG can achieve substantially higher deposition rates than conventional TIG/GTAW due to the higher current and higher energy density of the arc.", "How thick can the landing be?", "The optimal thickness of the landing is dependent on the material and thickness, but as a general rule the landing should be approximately 70% of the maximum thickness that K-TIG can penetrate in that material, to allow for melt-in from the side walls of the preparation.", "For example, K-TIG\u2019s maximum penetration in Titanium is 16mm (5/8 inch). If welding 20mm (25/32 inch) titanium, we would typically recommend performing the full penetration root pass on a landing of 10mm (13/32 inch).", "What is the recommended preparation and angle?", "There are many different bevel angles and geometries which can be used. We generally recommend that a V-prep with an included angle of 60-70 degrees or more is beneficial. The reason why we prefer a wider geometry is that you get some \u2018melt-in\u2019 from the sides of the preparation, which adds to the overall thickness which must be fully penetrated. The wider the prep, the less melt in and therefore a greater thickness of material can be penetrated in the root pass.", "Apart from the angle of the preparation, different preparation shapes can also be beneficial. For instance, a U-prep is excellent in eliminating melt-in from the sides. Another interesting variation is welding into an inverted-V-prep, in which the welding is performed from the opposite side of the preparation. This works extremely well, and allows maximum penetration as the apex of the preparation helps to support the keyhole even in very thick materials.", "How tolerant is K-TIG to fitup imperfections?", "K-TIG process is more tolerant to gaps, mismatches and other fitup imperfections than Plasma Arc Welding (PAW) and much more tolerant that Laser Beam Welding (LBW) due to the high inherent stability of the weld pool and self-correcting nature of the keyhole.", "Exceptional results are obtained with good fit-up, and the productivity gains and cost savings of K-TIG can be fully realised if care is taken to provide good square fitup.", "What mismatch is acceptable?", "Mismatch height is typically acceptable up to 20% of joint thickness.

While good quality welds can be achieved, the practical upper limit for full penetration PAW welding is 8-10mm (5/16 to 13/32 inch), and is more typically used for root passes of 4-6mm (5/32 to 1/4 inch) followed by filler passes using TIG.", "PAW is characterised by an orifice to pinch the arc, accurate alignment with the electrode, frequent maintenance, high level of complexity, the need for both plasma and shield gases to form the jet and protect the orifice, very accurate determination and maintenance of flow rates, low inherent stability of the keyholes due to reliance on a combination of gas pressures and energy density to achieve penetration, high degree of sensitivity to the many parameters involved, highly precise fitup and high degree of operator skill to set up, operate and maintain.", "PAW is widely regarded as the most complex of the arc welding processes. PAW systems incur the highest maintenance costs of any arc welding process due to their complexity.", "By contrast, K-TIG can weld materials up to 16mm (5/8 inch) in thickness, and typically operates at twice the travel speed of PAW. K-TIG is very simple to operate. The arc structure and keyhole develop spontaneously and are maintained automatically by the controller throughout the weld. There is no plasma nozzle or orifice, no precise electrode alignment is required, only one welding gas is used, flow rate is not critical, and the torches are very robust.", "I\u2019m currently using Plasma Arc Welding, should I switch to K-TIG?", "If you are currently using Plasma Arc Welding (PAW) you are almost certainly a model K-TIG customer. You will probably be welding stainless steel of between 3mm and 10mm (1/8 to 13/32 inch). You will have already invested in automation equipment to provide a consistent travel speed, typically a positioner, rotator, seamer or column & boom. Your application is probably pressure vessels, suction vessels, cryogenics and you are probably performing a longitudinal seam weld followed by two circumferential welds. You are probably experiencing unacceptable defect rates and are struggling with thicker materials.", "What is involved in changing to K-TIG?", "A fabricator who is currently using Plasma Arc Welding (PAW) will find upgrading to K-TIG to be straightforward. The existing welding automation system (typically a positioner, rotator, seamer or column & boom) can continue to be used.", "Changing from PAW to K-TIG requires only the normal setup of the K-TIG system and (if desired) integration of the controller to the existing welding automation system.", "Can K-TIG be used for manual welding?", "K-TIG is a precision process, and one of the important requirements is for consistent travel speed. It\u2019s for this reason that K-TIG is ideally suited to applications where an automation system which controls travel speed can be used.", "While in theory K-TIG could be performed manually in some situations, it is not recommended or supported.", "Can I use my existing power supply for K-TIG?", "It is necessary to use the K-TIG power unit due to the high level of integration which is required between the controller and the power unit.", "What training is required?", "Three hours of training is sufficient for operators in a typical production situation.

According to a recent forecast by the International Federation of Robotics, this amounts to an additional 1.4 million new industrial robots on today\u2019s figures (World Robotics 2016 Industrial Robots Report).", "This increased uptake of robotics and advanced welding technology (such as K-TIG) by industry is often tied to the loss of jobs, with the issue of welder employment rates inevitably raised.", "However, in reality, the impact of introducing advanced welding technologies has quite the opposite effect. The benefits that technology such as K-TIG offers to welders are myriad, ranging from more employment opportunities and much greater job security, through to improved working conditions.", "The introduction and implementation of advanced welding processes and technology like K-TIG is helping reverse a generation of off-shoring that has seen enormous volumes (and billions of dollars\u2019 worth) of fabrication sent offshore to China and other low labour cost countries.", "It is often impossible for American, Australian and European manufacturers to compete with cheap welded imports, particularly from China.

K-TIG automates, streamlines and makes welding processes more efficient, ensuring companies stay competitive, thereby securing even more work.

In comparison, manual welding requires a high degree of concentration over sustained periods, inevitably resulting in welder fatigue and increasing the likelihood of defects.", "Cleanliness plays a key role in welding quality. If a welder does not properly clean the components being welded, the results can be disastrous. Contaminants such as dirt, dust, grease or even the oils in skin introduced during a weld can cause incomplete fusion, porosity, cracking and poor bead appearance. These issues compromise the weld\u2019s performance, longevity, and its ability to resist corrosion.

Eliminating slag, flux and spatter results in a much higher quality weld and eliminates the potential for inclusions.", "K-TIG\u2019s advanced welding technology delivers high quality, single pass, full pentration GTAW welding.", "When the welding of thicker materials requires multiple passes, the likelihood of porosity, inclusions at the toes of the passes, and lack of fusion all significantly increase. In addition, cleaning and grinding is required between each pass, increasing the likelihood of inclusions.", "Reducing the number of passes can be key to improving overall weld quality. K-TIG welds, for instance, can be completed in a single pass in titanium up to 16mm, and in stainless steel up to 13mm.

K-TIG can comfortably perform full penetration welds on stainless steel up to 13mm (1/2 inch) thick in a single pass. SAW, on the other hand, has limited penetrative capabilities, with single pass penetration only available on materials up to 4mm thick. To penetrate materials beyond this thickness, V-groove root and filler passes are necessary, which significantly adds to the cost, timeframe and productivity of the operation.", "When performing stainless steel welding, K-TIG also dramatically reduces the costs of consumables.

The purpose of the latch on a MIG gun is to ensure that the welder or operator must only pull the trigger once, and can then let go. The wire then feeds out at a consistent rate, allowing the welder or operator to focus on their welding technique and positioning. The welder no longer has to concentrate on preventing simple mistakes like relaxing and taking their finger off the trigger or, worse yet, cramping up and losing their grip completely. There is also a similar latch feature built into high-frequency TIG torches with 2T and 4T.", "Prior to the introduction of the latch feature, welders had to use and manually replace welding rods.

This enables a welder to stand in the same position while constantly welding a level surface.", "The benefits of using this type of welding automation are vast. Rotators, rollers and turntables help reduce welder fatigue and boost productivity; the welder does not need to constantly move around the pipe to complete the weld and the frequent interruptions to the welding process required for re-positioning of the workpiece are eradicated. This type of automation also tends to improve weld consistency and quality because vertical and overhead runs are eradicated.", "\u00a0", "With increasing quantities of linear or longitudinal seam welding came the introduction of seamers and track driven buggies.", "The traditional process used for longitudinal seam welding required that a welder manually hold the workpieces in place, tack weld the pieces together, and then perform the longitudinal seam weld using a handheld welding torch.
