The point of the \u201cdemand-driven\u201d system for universities was to open up access to students from under-represented and non-traditional backgrounds.

Without doubt the VET fee help scandal was a disaster for the sector, though Gittins doesn\u2019t come clean on why the public TAFEs were so ripe for disruption.", "The reality is that institutional ossification had set in, with TAFE suffering from an inflexible, aging workforce that was unwilling to adapt or change to meet the needs of students. By some measures, as much as 60 cents of every dollar of TAFE funding was going to overheads, not classroom teaching. To pull that apart would have required either a Labor government assaulting one of its foundational pillars of support - the union movement - or a Liberal government getting locked in a stalemate and fighting a potentially unwinnable battle.", "The truth is somewhat different to what Gittins would have us believe.

Narrative essays are factual, still have a thesis and follow a conventional essay structure. Short stories are often fictional, do not need a thesis statement or have introduction, body and conclusions. Persuasive essays convince readers to act or believe in something with emotive opinions. Argumentative essays go steps further by citing scientific facts, statistics and expert quotations.

Note that anecdotal accounts are not necessarily reliable.", "Persuasive essays use logic and reason to show that one idea is better than another by trying to convince readers to think certain ways or to do something.

Clear and precise evidence is presented, including consideration for the opposing view.", "The ", "writing process", " for narrative and persuasive essays are different. Narrative essays are initiated by selecting an incident that occurred in real life. A thesis statement is drafted with the time, location and significance of event for the introduction. The body paragraphs are written in chronological order. A new paragraph starts whenever the story alters direction, the scene varies and there is dialogue between characters. Then the essay is filled with vivid details of the five senses and verbs. There is usually less focus on feelings and thoughts. Transitional expressions to link events are added to help with a logical flow. Finally, a resonating conclusion is reached.", "The persuasive essay starts with an attention grabber and thesis statement in the introduction. The position taken is always for or against an issue, so it can be debated. The thesis statement informs the reader about the topic, its limits and how the essay is organised. The body provides evidence such as facts, statistics, quotes and examples to support opinion. This section anticipates opposition viewpoints with concessions and provide rebuttals. Transitional expressions are also used to cue the reader for the next logical point. The conclusion summarises significant details and repeats what the reader is to believe or do in a call to action.", "Narrative essays are vastly different to persuasive essays.

Many organisations that offer software-based services \u2013 such as online quizzes or pre-recorded, video-based instruction \u2013 call themselves online tutoring providers.

After all, Socrates was Plato\u2019s tutor, and Plato in turn taught Aristotle.", "Dr. Nelson-Royes also discusses the extensive evidence base for tutoring as one of the most effective methods of imparting knowledge. In the same way that high-performing athletes and musicians make use of the best expert tuition to hone their skills and improve their performance, educators have long understood that a good tutor can assist a student to learn far more quickly than in a typical classroom setting.", "The reason is obvious: one-to-one or one-to-few attention tailors instruction to the needs of the individual, as opposed to the group. Whether for students who would like to improve their performance in a subject or skill (such as writing), prepare for a high-stakes exam, or simply fill in some knowledge gaps and feel more confident in the classroom, tutoring can help just about everyone.", "\u00a0", "Studiosity is an online study help service, connecting Australia's best and brightest educators to students during homework time.\u00a0", "Sign up now to see how it works.", "\u00a0", "Studiosity is core skills and study help; anywhere, anytime.", "We've been helping students succeed since 2003.", "Studiosity is personalised study help... anywhere!", "Did you know us as '", "YourTutor", "'?
