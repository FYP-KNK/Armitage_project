There's usually a sequence of changes required and these may occur over long periods of time. So as Olver puts it, \"you might need four or five 'hits' to [ultimately] cause cancer\". Sunlight on your skin could be responsible for more than one of those \"hits\" over time; in some people, sun might trigger most of them, he says. \"But we know it's not the sole factor at play because we do find cancers in non-sun-exposed areas [of the body].\"", "\"We don't want people [who find a spot] to think, just because it's on the soles of their feet or behind their ears, 'it can't be melanoma'.

About 10 per cent of melanomas occur in people with a family history of melanoma. In these people, the odds a skin cancer will be in a hidden body part are higher than for others because of the \"bad genes\" they have inherited. \"If you've got a cancer-causing gene, you've already got some or most of the changes needed [to trigger a cancer] because you've inherited them,\" he says.", "While skin checks by doctors are important, don't ignore things you notice yourself at other times.\"You need to get to know what your skin looks like and if you think anything's changing \u2013 getting darker, changing in pigmentation, size, shape, itching, or bleeding \u2013 then report it immediately.\"", "Source: ", "ABC Health and Well-being", "Subscribe to our newsletter!", "Sorry, something went wrong, please refresh the page and try again.", "Please enter your first name", "Please enter a valid email address", "Subscribe to our newsletter!", "Are you at risk?
