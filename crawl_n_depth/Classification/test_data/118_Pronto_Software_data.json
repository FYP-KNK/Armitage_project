Here are five action points to guide your software selection journey and enable a successful implementation.", "1. Define and map out your key processes first", "It is recommended that you look closely at your existing business processes and map out the ones that you would like to develop. Be proud of the ones that work and equally critical of the ones that don\u2019t. You can start with listing pain points which should form the basis for a checklist of discovery topics you\u2019ll need to take into the vendor discovery process. Although it sounds obvious, it\u2019s often a case where clients will find a number of vendors and allow them to drive the discovery process. The goal should be to articulate the process requirements and openly challenge assumptions \u2013 as you can take these into the demonstration phase. You will quickly begin to understand where their solution adapts to, or improves, your workflows.", "2. Does it work out of the box?", "There are potentially three solution types up to consider: generic accounting packages, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions and bespoke or \u2018written for you\u2019 solutions. Each naturally has their own advantages and disadvantages. All should cover off your basic account needs, so it often will come down to your key business processes and how competently the vendor can manage this \u2018out of the box\u2019 or using configurations, customisations or integration. The basic rule is that, the more the vendor covers in the one solution, the less additional support you\u2019ll require to meet your business needs, as your business grows. It might come at a higher cost initially but the benefits should make it worth the investment.", "3. Consider your size and the digital future of your business", "Depending on the size of your business a software solution could be your most valuable asset or simply create more overheads for your team to manage. It can\u2019t be stressed enough that you should be considering where you see the business in 5-10 years. For example, are your business partners or their customers moving to digital platforms? Many suppliers are now seen as needing to fulfil the supply chain at the customer level. This is driven by the upsurge in digital commerce. An investment now might secure the growing needs of the industry as it evolves at the speed of customers.", "4. Business reporting and analytics", "The more informed you are about your operations, the better you\u2019ll be able to streamline them enabling you and your stakeholder to spend valuable time on strategic development. Look for solutions that offer analytics technology within the overall business management solution. The platform should provide transparency across all operational processes, preferably through integrated BI functionality with the specific tools that meet your supply chain needs.", "5. Be prepared to invest more than expected on implementation", "Through a proper discovery process, the chosen vendor should be able to provide you with an implementation budget. Make sure to question any fixed cost implementations as there\u2019s no telling what might be uncovered, on both sides. Consider what you would be prepared to invest if the budget does goes beyond scope and be prepared for it. It\u2019s not uncommon for a business to alter its focus during the implementation which often alters the budget. Define what physical resources will be needed to make the implementation a success. Never assume the vendor will fill the gap. There\u2019s no point in placing the blame after the fact, so ensure you\u2019ve provided them with as much detail about your business processes and expectations up front. Finally ensure that milestones are met on both ends and be critical of your own commitment.", "In many businesses, choosing new software will require a complete re-think of operations, infrastructure and technology.

So how does this description fit within the context of the Manufacturing sector here in Australia? Many suggest that although we\u2019re currently witnessing the death of several key players we\u2019re certainly not witnessing the death of local manufacturing itself.", "According to the Cambridge Institutes definition there\u2019s more to manufacturing than simply the production of products. The R&D life cycle management and services stemming from the sale of products are essentially activities that vitally underpin an industry that has been under threat over recent times. There\u2019s little doubt the dumping of cheap imports into Australia has had a significant impact on local manufacturers, to address this problem the Government has introduced the Anti-Dumping Commission to police what is referred to as \u2018countervailable subsidies\u2019 where foreign governments provide financial assistance to their exporters. This policy may help us as consumers buy more locally produced product in the short term but it doesn\u2019t necessarily make local manufacturers more competitive for the longer term. Innovation and value add principles however will ensure Australian manufacturing keeps pace with other countries who have invested in innovation such as Sweden, Germany and more recently Brazil.", "More agile SME\u2019s are being urged to innovate and adopt practices that are more sustainable and add more value to their supply chain, they have the advantage of producing higher quality products tailored to suit niche markets that are willing to pay more for a quality product. The term \u2018Mittelstand\u2019 in Germany is used to describe the cottage industry of local manufacturers that were seen as responsible for supporting Germany\u2019s faltering manufacturing industry back in 2009. Smaller quality focussed companies invested heavily in their technology and their people, some provided generous incentives in a bid to retain skills by ensuring staff retention. Now it\u2019s reported that 70 percent of the countries workforce is employed by the 3 million Mittlestand, this is a staggering statistic that sits alongside Germany\u2019s other great accolade as the being the world\u2019s fourth largest automobile producer.", "We shouldn\u2019t ignore the importance of low-tech industries either, whose business models work in conjunction with high tech industries by providing low value-add commodity products that contribute to the diversity of the greater supply chain. Naturally these interdependent businesses rely heavily on big producers, so when we witness the downfall of large manufacturers the wider impact is felt by many smaller companies that have perhaps invested so heavily and have grown so reliant on a sole supply contract.", "Locally when we think of high precision, high value-add products we can look towards success stories within industries such as automotive, medical, electronics, pharmaceuticals and scientific instruments. Companies such as Ecotech who manufacture and export air monitoring systems to over 70 countries; Rode whose quality microphones stand equal to some of the most rare and collectable Neumann models, and also Hy Gain Feeds who have developed nutritional equine supplements that assist in disease prevention, these companies have all carved a niche within Australia\u2019s manufacturing sector by leveraging innovation in a drive for global competitiveness. These three companies have proven that Australia can produce products at a higher quality than anywhere else and can deliver this value locally and internationally; so much so that their products have earned each of them critical acclaim in the areas of design, innovation and export.", "The continued growth within the engineer to order sector has also changed the way companies interact with their customers, suppliers and information systems. ETO brings about many challenges for smaller organisations that don\u2019t have the sophisticated infrastructure to facilitate complex tenders or projects based works. So being agile enough to be able to switch production from one product to another quickly has boosted competitiveness amongst local manufacturers.", "Having the right business processes in place operating within a collaborative workspace means that companies are equipped to capture customer information, track project related orders, manage project billing and their related costs down to the activity level. These features are essential in adapting high value solutions for their clients and future proofing organisations that need to remain competitive.

These companies will use social media to crowd source new ideas and as such will be well positioned to quickly capitalise on untapped areas of demand. Perhaps one of the key strengths of our industry is its smaller size, the nimbleness of local highly skilled organisations enable a greater level of agility not available to larger corporations.", "So manufacturing in Australia is by no means dying, what we\u2019re witnessing is an industry in a state of transition and redefinition. Almost 1 million Australians (or 8.5% of the workforce) are directly employed by the manufacturing sector; sadly almost 100,000 jobs as a result of the GFC in 2008. Interestingly however the percentage of highly skilled employees has grown over the last 10 years from 19% to 25% and although the increase isn\u2019t dramatic it does reflect a change in the right direction. The government must also play its part by investing in innovation, without the support manufacturers will struggle to compete so they must be cognisant of the fact that for every manufacturing job in Australia, approximately 3 to 4 others are created as a result.", "Getting the right mix of small scale, high value manufacturing working in conjunction with larger low tech production is essential for the long term survival of this industry. Known as the \u2018big multiplier\u2019 it draws on services and raw materials, employs a highly skilled workforce and acts as a bridge between other industries. An evolutionary shift towards innovation and high value manufacturing is resulting in a number of successful companies bucking the trend and prospering in these times where local manufacturing now contributes to only 8% of GDP.", "The future of manufacturing in Australia depends on tapping into the rich reserves of intellectual property found in areas like medical research. In 1981 Dr Graeme Clark invented the Nucleus cochlear implant, today the company turns over $752 million whilst over 250,000 people have received a life changing Cochlear ear implant.

Sparse design, no visual clutter, minimal colour palette, crisp typography and clear navigation have all become design attributes we now expect in apps designed for individuals, and from a commercial aspect, service organisations. So now in the field services sector the demand for slick, easy to use mobile apps is growing and so too is their purpose and role with regards to the collection of data.", "Field service mobility is constantly evolving, and solutions in the market today provide service technicians with most of the functionality they need to effectively and efficiently manage service issues out on site, but the dilemma for ERP and mobility vendors is how do they present mature business software functionality via a narrow funnel so that features can be published within a sleek and minimalist web app. What functionality do you leave in? More importantly what do you leave out? What mobility allows for is the instantaneous capture and feedback of this vital data and with that it also opens a wide array of possibilities relating to intelligence and how it can be best used to make better decisions", "Big data is now becoming a reality for SME\u2019s especially within the Asset and Facilities Management sector, so much so that data is now regarded as a company asset. Mobile Service solutions now enable the capture and management of large file types such as photos, movie files, CAD drawings and other engineering documents that all contribute to the ever growing amounts of structured and unstructured data. So when we combine this with data feeds from asset monitoring systems or even hit rates from integrated eCommerce or social media feeds, the need for business analytics for SME\u2019s becomes essential. As business analytics tools offer a quantitative understanding of businesses, these tools are now on offer to smaller organisations who take that quantum leap from small business software packages up to a fully integrated ERP solution. The reality today is that industry demands better information from the systems they invest in, however an understanding of how data can be converted into knowledge is still a mystery to many. A conversation I recently had with a Civil Engineer involved in a recent ERP implementation at his workplace claimed, \u201cThe data we\u2019re now getting is so comprehensive we just don\u2019t know what to do with it yet\u201d", "The next step is having skilled people who are able to present this data in a compelling way, a dilemma my engineer friend is still coming to terms with.

But equally so mobile service applications are the critical link that provides a healthy supply of data used to deliver strategic and operational insight and improved service delivery.

Put simply, it serves to deliver corporate information to all users within an organisation without the IT department\u2019s involvement (or at least as little as is practical). Its goal is to get information in the hands of anyone who needs to make a data-driven decision, whether it be tactical or strategic in nature.", "However, BI isn\u2019t one size fits all. What\u2019s important for the general business user \u2013 the teams on the shop floor, in the back office, out on the road servicing clients or managing stock in the warehouse \u2013 is often quite different to that of the senior executive developing the business strategy or running the operations of the business.", "Let\u2019s first look at the general business user.\u00a0 They\u2019re predominantly interested in tactical and operational activities \u2013 they need simple, quick information to help them perform the job at hand. Content delivered to them is typically in the form of report lists, pre-built analysis and simple dashboards with KPIs to identify any variance from ordinary events. Information should be available on hand from whatever device they use, mobile or in the office. Traditionally, BI has not been deployed in any significant numbers to these business users, but the trend is shifting.", "Next in the chain of command are Business or Product Line Managers whose responsibility it is to run functions of the business. These executives need richer capabilities to examine a wider range of data drivers and to better explain or understand their organisation\u2019s performance. However, they do not usually have the experience or inclination to learn the tools necessary to develop the content \u2013 they just want the information presented in a way that lets them explore their data to identify trends, anomalies, significant variances in results and areas for improvement. The business manager has a greater leaning towards analysing information for strategic purposes, rather than using information to perform a specific task. Let\u2019s take the example of a manager in charge of warehouse operations. Analysis for them might include reviewing all stock on hand, and then \u2018slicing\u2019 that information by warehouse, or by product group, or by supplier and seeing where there is excess or depleted stock. This analysis may have been prompted by another report or alert highlighting that on-time shipments were below plan and that the cause was due to inventory shortage. This information may not easily be accessible without BI.", "Another consumer of BI is the Business or Financial Analyst whose responsibility it is to offer continual review of performance across all aspects of a business. They may also develop analysis reports for Business Managers. Smaller businesses may give this role to a technical manager or finance consultant or even share the responsibility. These users typically understand their data well, have familiarity with BI tools and are able to produce more complex reports and analysis models to support the business. Often the analyst will be tasked with requirements gathering and analysis for a new business initiative, or to develop and implement test plans to ensure successful delivery of a project. Reporting on such initiatives is crucial and where BI tools often become essential in their day to day activities.\u00a0 Whilst analysts have a technical leaning towards data modelling, a simplified and pre-modelled BI environment will assist them in producing the required content that the business asks of them far quicker. Analysts should not be spending significant time understanding data relationships, structures and extracting raw data \u2013 they should focus on providing the reporting outcomes that the business needs.", "In summary, whatever role you play in the business, there is value in accessing business data to garner informational insights, do your job quicker or more effectively as well as make better decisions. The tools you use and the depth of analysis you perform will likely be different, but your single BI environment should cater for each individual\u2019s needs.", "7 Sep 2018", "Knowing what is selling, what customers value most, and where costs can be cut is the sure way to maximise\u2026", "7 Sep 2018", "Knowing what is selling, what customers value most, and where costs can be cut is the sure way to maximise\u2026", "21 Nov 2013", "For many retailers managing business processes, resources and legislation will be a continuous challenge.

The idea was to offer the new software to customers, differentiating CMAD from its competitors who just offered hardware. CMAD leaders however did not see immediate results from the plan and jumped to the conclusion that the future of software was limited! They made a decision to sell-off the business. Dave who was passionate about what he helped create, decided to buy it. I think this is particularly important because at our core, we remain innovators with a deep passion for what we build.", "Dave created a company called Prometheus Software and redesigned the software, renaming it Pronto! Prometheus Software grew rapidly and we won many customers. The profitability of the business drew the attention of a very successful dot-com business called Sausage Software. They approached Dave and he decided to sell the business, strongly believing that this was a path for the advancement of Prometheus. As we all know however, in the year 2000, the dot-com bubble burst and Sausage Software fell into trouble. Another well-known business, SMS Management, managed a reverse takeover of Sausage Software, acquiring Prometheus as part of the deal. Their business strategy did not include what Prometheus offered and as a result, they decided to put us up for sale.", "Our CEO at that time, David Jackman, was a visionary. He knew this was a profitable business with a solid customer base \u2013 we just needed the opportunity to have a good run. David worked with the management team to write a prospectus and organised a staff buyout. Employees took out personal loans to acquire the funds as the business did not have any institutional debt. I believe this is where our indomitable spirit and the strong collaborative nature of our employees was born.", "With people who owned the business working in the business, the company grew from strength to strength. Employees received the money they invested within two years \u2013 and it has been repaid many times over since then. In 2012, we restructured into a public company and more staff were able to buy-in at that stage. Out of our current 420+ staff members, we have about 150 who own part of the company.
