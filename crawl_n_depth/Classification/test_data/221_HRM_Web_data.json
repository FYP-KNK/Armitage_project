With easyEMPLOYER for example, pharmacy staff can go into the system, put in a shift swap request and have a look at who else is suitable and available to work that shift. Only people who match the role and the task and who are available will show up as options for the swap. All the manager needs to do is give it the final approval. If a staff member can\u2019t work a given shift, you can make it his or her responsibility to find someone else to cover it, so you don\u2019t have to.

There\u2019s also an environmental benefit to using the cloud.

The fundamentals of how you hold on to good staff haven\u2019t changed: rewards, recognition, flexibility. One thing to consider is how you talk to staff about what these changes mean for their role. Let them know what opportunities the expanded services could mean for their career.", "Rostering in a pharmacy can be hard enough as it is. Pharmacists. Assistants. Naturopaths. With an even broader range of skill sets under the one roof, it\u2019s vital to make sure you\u2019ve always got people rostered on who are trained and qualified to do the work. Without that, your business is left exposed. Imagine this scenario. Mrs Jones comes into your pharmacy to have her dressings checked. It\u2019s Monday afternoon, and you don\u2019t have anyone rostered on who\u2019s qualified. Jason, a pharmacy assistant, offers to do this, just to be helpful. Unfortunately, Mrs Jones develops a life-threatening infection, and decides to sue. If you\u2019d had a qualified person rostered on that afternoon, you could\u2019ve shown that you\u2019d done everything possible to give responsible care. Automated rostering support is a smart choice to keep your pharmacy covered. The application automatically creates a draft roster, based on your business requirements and the needs of your staff. So you can instantly pull up a shift and check that you\u2019ve got the right number and skill level of staff rostered on throughout the week.", "As you test out new services, you\u2019ll come back to the basic question: are we making money? If you brought on extra staff to deliver primary care services, what\u2019s the return? This information is vital in the early stages as you decide whether to hold your course, or try a different tack. That\u2019s where automated, real-time staffing cost tracking comes into play. Get a break-down of costs per staff member, per day \u2013 as well as total cost per week. Match this data with foot traffic to make strategic, intelligent decisions about what\u2019s working \u2013 and project what staffing levels you\u2019ll need going forward. No more \u2018guestimating\u2019 rosters. And no more worrying about going over your staffing budget.", "Other pharmacies are likely to wait till all the details of the primary care services are announced, then scramble to catch-up.

The payroll may still be manual, and they may not be using software to track payroll, apart from just the basic accounting package functions.", "What they\u2019re missing out on is what else can they get from their payroll process, apart from just paying people.", ".", "EE: Why do you think businesses aren\u2019t doing more with this data?", "Tony:", " A lot of businesses don\u2019t look at their labour line as a cost centre. When I talk to businesses and ask \u2018What\u2019s your cost of sales versus your cost of labour?\u2019, they look at you blankly. They don\u2019t really know what the true cost of labour is to their business.", ".", "EE: So where\u2019s a good place to start?", "Tony:", " The first thing would be to have a budget for their payroll. Compare their budget versus their actual outlay. Is that where their business needs to be?", "Back when I was a manager of a KFC, we used to run this report called SETWR: the Store Employee Time Work Report. That listed all the employees, the hours that they worked, and all the breaks. The smart managers would look at the cost of that roster each day, and then plug into a daily KPI tracker that linked it to sales. So if I budgeted for 10 hours today and I\u2019ve used 15, why did I use 15?", ".", "EE: So going over could actually be a good thing?", "Tony:", " Yes, potentially. Maybe you did so much business one day that staff needed to stay back to cover it. You should definitely be tracking the labour costs, but also linking it in with other metrics, like turnover.", ".", "EE: What tools can people use to support this?", "Tony:", " Well, the technology has come in leaps and bounds in the last five years. You\u2019ve got products like yours, easyEMPLOYER, which is cool and light, and does all the rostering and integration.

Man-perms. Milli Vanilla. There\u2019s plenty of 1980s artifacts that we\u2019re glad to put behind us, but many businesses are still using old-school time\u00a0& attendance\u00a0technology. Punch-clocks. Signing in at the front desk. Hand-written timesheets. These outdated technologies result in inaccurate time clocking, which means payroll is calculated on hours that aren\u2019t reflective of actual time worked. You risk underpayment, and often overpayment, of staff \u2013 costing your business. Not only that, old technology can\u2019t offer you the efficiency gains that newer time & attendance\u00a0technology can.So we\u2019ll take a closer look at old tech versus new tech \u2014 and what that means for your bottom line.", "Whether it\u2019s punching in, swiping in or signing on, old-school technology is vulnerable because it depends on the honesty and accuracy of your employees.", "In a handful of cases, businesses face out-and-out dishonesty, where an employee sets out to rort the system. For example, they ask a colleague to clock on for them so they can take the day off. Then there is a raft of other situations which employees may not consider in the same league, but which still hit your bottom line. Let\u2019s say, an employee just rounds up their timesheet by a few minutes so it\u2019s a nice even number.", "For that one employee on that one day, the dollar amount involved is miniscule. Across an organisation, though, and across a whole year, it adds up. Let\u2019s take an organisation of 20 employees with an average pay rate of $20 per hour. Just five minutes of time-creep a day will cost that organisation $35,000 a year!", "Old-school time-clocking is also prone to accidental errors. For example, an employee finished early last Tuesday, but forgets about it when she fills in her timesheet, and claims hours as if she\u2019d worked right up till five. Another employee types an 8, not a 3.", "It\u2019s not just your immediate bottom-line that\u2019s at stake. In heavily regulated industries such as aged-care and child-care, you have to show that your staffing ratios are in order at all times. You need absolute confidence that you\u2019ve got accurate records of who\u2019s rostered on.", "We see some businesses that have partly adopted new technology, by switching to online timesheets. Here, the format has changed, but the working practices remain the same. Instead of completing timesheets by hand, employees type into a table. The data is easier to wrangle than a ring-binder full of timesheets, but the system is still vulnerable to accidental and intentional inaccuracies.", "New time clocking technology comes in many different forms. The most effective technology is biometric scanning, with fingerprint scanning being particularly popular. What ties these new technologies together are the following benefits.", "New technology can cut down on many of the opportunities for error. If your timesheet is captured directly using biometrics, there\u2019s no room for your staff to get their 8\u2019s and 3\u2019s mixed up. There\u2019s also no room for deliberate manipulation.", "When you automate your time\u00a0& attendance, it becomes quick and easy to analyse the data and pull out useful insights. You can drill into questions of attendance: is that one employee really consistently turning up late, or was it just a one-off? Is that person always calling in sick on Mondays? Many managers appreciate the visibility they gain from having this tracking automated: they don\u2019t need to constantly monitor their staff\u2019s movements to make sure they\u2019re doing the right thing.", "New time clocking technology also makes it easier to aggregate data. For example, in easyEMPLOYER\u2019s attendance reporting, you can break down the timesheet data by location, department, or by staffing level, so you can check whether there may be a culture of absenteeism developing. With this kind of intelligence behind you, you can step in and address the issues before they become an issue.", "When time\u00a0& attendance\u00a0is totally automated, workforce management gets a whole lot easier. Timesheet data is populated automatically, and just needs final review and sign-off. You save time at the employee side, with reduced data entry time. And you save time at the HR resourcing side, with massively reduced administration overheads.", "The efficiency gains of automated timesheet management don\u2019t stop there, though.
