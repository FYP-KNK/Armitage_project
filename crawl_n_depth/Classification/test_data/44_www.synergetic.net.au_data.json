We successfully completed the ATO\u2019s final Product Verification Testing requirement, which used a single client\u2019s live environment to send a real pay run via STP for the ATO to confirm the content was correctly transmitted. We would like to sincerely thank Tintern Grammar in Victoria for taking part in this final test and facilitating the implementation of our first live STP environment.", "The final test was submitted on 14th June to the ATO\u2019s internal verification process to complete\u2014we received notification from the ATO of their approval on Friday 29th June and immediately announced our Gold Release for client production systems.", "As this timing coincided with both the school holidays and the commencement of the new payroll year, there were a number of clients who were keen to obtain the v69 release and commence using STP as soon as possible. Synergetic committed to accommodating any client requests for a v69 upgrade, and over the course of the July school holiday period we deployed v69 to a significant number of client sites, who now are able to utilise the STP functionality.", "Currently, we have 65 clients using v69 within their live environment, of which 29 individual clients have now gone live with STP and transmitted data to the ATO several times. Synergetic has also been using STP for our own payroll process since July 1st 2018.", "Around the time of your v69 upgrade commencing, one of our team members will request to make contact with your staff member responsible for Payroll to discuss a few configuration aspects and offer some initial guidance on how to enable STP.", "Synergetic will then configure your organisation within the STP sending service provider using Ozedi, which acts as a secure transmission gateway to the ATO\u2019s own server.", "Once you have completed any initial setup activities such as updating Pay Codes for any changes relating to how STP operates, you will be able to enable the STP logic (it is set to disabled by default) and process your first pay run.", "Synergetic are aiming to monitor the initial send for each client, just to verify that each point in the transmission process is working as expected, with no network or other issues appearing.", "Once the STP transmission has been sent, you will see a status update within Synergetic, and once the response from ATO is received, this will also be reflected in a new status update within Synergetic.

Being able to use the Test environment was crucial in gaining an understanding of what needed to be completed in the live system to enable a smooth transition. Our first pay run using STP went well and credit goes to the Synergetic team responsible for development and testing of the system before it was released.", "As we had indicated in prior communications to clients, Synergetic obtained special approval from the ATO for our clients to commence STP transmissions at a later date than the legislated 1st July 2018.", "This is known as a vendor-based deferral, and was granted to Synergetic on behalf of our clients, to help support organisations who are not able to upgrade to v69 and use STP from the beginning of the 2019 payroll year. Typically this is related to sites who are running versions of Synergetic earlier than our v68 release (as the move to v68 with its single database architecture is larger and more complex than our usual version upgrades).", "The deferral window granted by the ATO is up to and including 31st January 2019. All Australian clients who are using Synergetic\u2019s Payroll module and who have not yet upgraded their live environment to v69, will need to arrange a version upgrade to v69 and enable STP before this end date.", "If you believe you have additional extenuating circumstances that will require your organisation to defer STP commencement later than 31st January, you will need to arrange your own employer-based deferral with the ATO directly.", "While STP was the first main feature for our v69 release, it is not intended to be the only feature.

This takes into account the time required for the backups, creation and migration from multi-database model to a single database model, copying data from the old databases into the new database, performing the application upgrades to v68, reconfiguring database settings for the new design, testing, rectifying faults and sign-off. There\u2019s a lot that we\u2019re trying to achieve.", "Our aim is to make the transition to v68 as seamless as possible, and trying to compress the amount of work required into a \u2018regular\u2019 Synergetic upgrade timeslot has not been as successful as we would have liked. The initiative to allocate a full day in advance will allow our clients and Synergetic staff to work together to address any issues that may arise during the process, as well as reduce the level of uncertainty as to when staff can start using the system again. We appreciate the inconvenience of having Synergetic offline for a full day as it is the central \u2018hub\u2019 for the school.
