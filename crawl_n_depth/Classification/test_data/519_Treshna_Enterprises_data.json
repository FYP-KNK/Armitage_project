This could include parking, towels, spin class, sauna, fitness reassessments etc. and in this example could be $25 a week. ", "Optional pricing", " is where a gym could offer a lower price, say $18 a week and the customer would have the flexibility to select the optional add-ons they require. \u00a0However, if the member required all optional extras, it would most likely be a greater cost than that of a gym offering bundle pricing. \u00a0This is because the bundle priced gym can assume not all members would take up all \u2018bundled\u2019 services thus resulting in potentially a lower cost and thus a lower price. So effectively the non-users would subsidize the actual users.", "There is no right or wrong approach as every client faces a different market environment. \u00a0What is important is that all factors are considered before a decision is made. When discussing this with some of the clubs that use GymMaster it became apparent that the following questions were key in coming to a decision.", "It is most likely a customer walking in the door will have a preconceived idea about the price based on research they have already conducted, and you need to think about whether you want to position your pricing in a similar way or stand to be different and overcome any customer\u2019s preconceived notions. Both ideas have pros and cons, depending on the psyche of the potential client it maybe difficult to sway them to a different thought process. Alternatively, it may make you stand out and more memorable \u2013 and this combined with a sell on your facility\u2019s features could be enough to sway the decision your way.", "A way to address this would be to construct a list of all features that could be chargeable within your facility and then think about the how frequently you would require each service e.g. 1 out of every 4 visits, and then how this relates to the majority of the clients. In my opinion, in an optional extra pricing strategy, core services should be included as standard and all core services should be classified as being utilized by a client in at least three out of every four sessions. If you need to charge a client extra in every session this would add to your administration and the perception may adversely affect the \u2018happy meter\u2019 of your client. When adopting the bundle approach, in order to win with a higher price it would be great to include a few services that wouldn\u2019t normally be expected to be included, appeal to the mass market and select items that don\u2019t have a significant cost of goods such as fresh towel service, free personal training session every 8 weeks etc.", "I believe this comes down to how you determine what is included as standard and what\u2019s an optional add-on as well as how it is explained on the initial visit before sign-up. As long as it is fair and explained up front, the sell won\u2019t be misleading and won\u2019t be construed as unethical. If one does blur over the optional extra\u2019s and associated charges this could result in negative repercussions down the track. It\u2019s about being transparent, fair and up front about the fine print.", "In my opinion high end users are less price elastic and would not be deterred by any method as long as payment required little administration and the full implications of either offering were transparent.

A rate of 66% or higher would put your facility performing about the industry benchmark.\u00a0 Setting up tasks to touch base with members four or six weeks before their membership expires will help improve this figure as well as ensuring members get regular reassessments as this will keep them invigorated and continue to attend as long as they are getting results.\u00a0 This is one of many suggestions, more of which can be found on our other blogs.", "At the click of a button you can navigate to the booking module and add a member into a class or set up a new booking.", "The first KPI is very useful in optimising class bookings.\u00a0 It is purely for all class types such as spin, aerobics, pilates, squash etc and doesn\u2019t include other types of bookings such as PT or cr\u00e8che bookings.

Annual Limits for Suspension", "Another issue with membership holds is certain members seeing these as an opportunity to take advantage of your fitness club.
