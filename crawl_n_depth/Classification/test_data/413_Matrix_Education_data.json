Cytokinesis completes the division of the cell into two unique daughter cells.", "The work of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch identified microbes as the cause of disease. Koch developed postulates to establish which specific microbe was associated with a disease. Pasteur experimented with vaccinations and developed a method of heating food products to kill off contaminating microbes (now known as pasteurisation). Once microbes were identified as the cause, efforts could focus on preventing the spread of microbes in order to prevent disease.", "Hygiene practices were introduced to encourage medical practitioners, food preparers and the general public to wash their hands regularly to prevent the spread of microbes. In many countries water filtration systems were introduced to provide clean drinking water to the public via methods such as filtration and chlorination. Quarantine requirements were developed to prevent the spread of diseases in plants, animals and people through international travel (e.g. shipping ports, airports, border crossings).", "An important technique to prevent disease is vaccination. Once a microbe has been identified as the cause of a disease, the antigens from its\u2019 surface can be isolated and used in a vaccination. Once injected into the body, the immune system learns to recognise the antigen and produce memory cells which will be activated if the pathogen is encountered. The introduction of wide-scale vaccination campaigns in the 20th century lead to a dramatic decrease in deaths from diseases such as polio which now only occurs in around 3 countries. Smallpox has now been completely eradicated saving millions of lives. Diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella are now very rare in developed countries with childhood vaccination schedules. This has had a major impact on the life expectancy of people at birth.", "New treatments for disease such as antivirals and antibiotics have had a huge impact. When antibiotics were first introduced in the 1940s they could easily cure what were once deadly bacterial infections. Antibiotics have saved millions of lives, but in recent years many bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics and new treatments must be found. As a result recent strategies have shifted from treatment to prevention.", "There was a dramatic increase in expected life span over the 20th century. This is particularly evident in new-borns, where the life expectancy increased from around 47 years to 73 years. This increase is due to biological developments in identification, treatment and prevention of disease during this time.", "The occurrence of colour vision corresponds to their use of colour in the environment. For example, planarians live in a dark environment and hence do not require any colour vision. They possess a basic eye-cup structure to only detect direction and intensity of light, but there is no need for colour as a form of visual communication, hence there is no need for colour vision.", "In contrast, bees are insects which possess compound eyes composed of a large number of singular photoreceptor units called ommatidia. Each ommatidia has its own lens, pigment and receptor cells. This results in trichromatic colour vision (UV, blue, green, orange but not red). Colour and UV is used as the means by which flowers are able to \u201ccommunicate their whereabouts\u201d to the bees for pollination. Honey bees detect a portion of the ultraviolet spectrum in addition to the blue-green end of the visible spectrum, ranging from 300-700 nm. Thus, colour vision in bees allows the organisms to quickly locate pollen and nectar.", "Snakes are able to detect light from 480-850 nm which includes the infrared part of the spectrum. As infrared light is produced by heat, snakes can use this sense to detect warm blooded prey at night when hunting.", "Sound is a particularly versatile form of communication and mammals such as humans have ears made up of an outer, middle, and inner ear segment. The inner ear includes the cochlea that converts sound into mechanical vibration of the ear hairs (stereocilia) and then into electrical signals that are sent to the brain. However sound detection mechanisms vary widely between animals. Different animals have different ranges of detection. For example bats can detect between 10 000 and 150 000 Hz as they use ultrasound for echolocation. By contrast elephants hear between 5 \u2013 12 000 Hz as they use infrasound for communication.", "Insects do not have a cochlea but have a Tympanum membrane on the front legs or abdomen that detect vibrations in air and Chordotonal organs located in the legs that detect vibration through surfaces.", "Fish have hard Otoliths that vibrate and cause hair cells to move, triggering sensory neurons. These are used for detection of high frequency sound while a Lateral line system (involving stereocilia in cupula) is used for detection of lower low frequency sounds. The swim bladder is used as a resonance chamber. Thus the models of hearing and vision in animals is very different to that of humans as animals have very different needs.", "A base substitution will replace just one base on the DNA. This will change a single codon on the mRNA and one incorrect amino acid will be included in the polypeptide. In some cases, a silent mutation will occur and the codon will still code for the same amino acid.", "or example, if the first base was changed from A to G the DNA sequence would read GTC AGT CGT ACG ATC GCA TA and the mRNA would read as CAG UCA GCA UGC UAG CGU AU. Only the first amino acid will be affected.", "By contrast, a frameshift mutation will change all of the codons in the gene from the point where the mutation occurred, potentially resulting in many more amino acids being incorrectly coded. This is more likely to result in a dysfunctional protein.", "For example, if a G was inserted at the beginning of the DNA sequence it would read GAT CAG TCG TAC GAT CGC ATA and the mRNA would read as CUA GUC AGC AUG CUA GCG UAU. All of the amino acids in this sequence would be incorrect and the protein product would likely be dysfunctional. (In fact the fourth codon is now a stop codon and the polypeptide will not be completed. This is a nonsense mutation.)", "However, Lynch syndrome does not cause cancer in 100% of individuals that are carrying the allele so some individuals in the family that do not have cancer may still be carrying the allele. The female that was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 37 is likely to have inherited lynch syndrome from the mother who was carrying the allele but did not have cancer.", "This means that 3/4 of the second generation had at least one allele for lynch syndrome and suggests that the parents in the first generation both were heterozygous for lynch syndrome.", "The Watson and Crick model of DNA allows to understand the double helix structure of the DNA molecule and how DNA is composed of the four bases (Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine). This allows us to examine the \u2018code\u2019 that makes up living things and was the first step in enabling researchers to manipulate that code. Beadle and Tatum established that sections of the DNA called \u2018genes\u2019 were providing the code for the production of proteins, or polypeptides more specifically.", "Eventually the process of transcription and translation was discovered, whereby a gene is copied as mRNA which is then read by a ribosome. The ribosome assembles amino acids based on the code on the mRNA.", "In order to research diseases, the genes that are responsible for them had to be identified. The human genome project successfully located all coding genes on the human genome. It did not identify what they did but enabled scientists to map the location of genes and begin the process of identifying what each gene does and its potential role in disease. Once a disease-causing gene is identified, DNA sequencing enables scientists to identify the exact code of a disease-causing gene such as muscular dystrophy.", "This understanding of genes and DNA eventually lead to the development of transgenic organisms, where a gene from one species is inserted into the genome of another. For example, the muscular dystrophy gene can be removed from a human cell and inserted into the plasmid of a bacteria. The bacterium is allowed to reproduce by binary fission to produce many copies of the gene. The gene can then be inserted into a mouse egg nucleus, with the resulting offspring containing the gene in all of its cells.", "Tissue cells can then be taken from the offspring and used to produce clones. The tissue cells are fused with enucleated egg cells, and thus are the only contributors of genetic information. All of the offspring will be identical to the transgenic tissue donor. This process requires an understanding of how genetic information is contained in the nucleus.", "Models such as these are now regularly produced in order to study different human diseases.

In direct contact transmission there is some physical contact between an infected person and a susceptible person e.g. mucus droplets spread the common flu virus. This causes diseases to spread quickly in densely populated areas. In indirect contact transmission there is no direct human-to human contact e.g. bite from insect vector causes Malaria. The spread of the disease may be easier to control.", "\u00a0", "(a) Between 1900 to 2010 there has been an increase in the human population from 1.2 to 6.8 billion and an increase in the actual number of people at risk of Malaria from 0.9 billion to 3.4 billion. Despite this, the percentage of the population at risk of Malaria has actually decreased from 75% to 50% and the number of countries that experience cases of Malaria has declined from 140 to 88. By contrast, reported cases of dengue fever has increased from 1950 to 2010 and the disease has spread to many more countries and continents in that time (e.g. South America, Africa, Australia).", "(b) Since the world population has increased, with many people living in high density areas, this provides an opportunity for diseases such as Dengue fever and Malaria to spread. However, Malaria is a disease that has occurred in the human population for thousands of years and by contrast dengue is a relatively new disease occurring between 100-800 years ago and has been restricted geographically until the 1950s, this makes most of the human population susceptible hosts that do not have immunity to the disease. While Malaria is caused by the plasmodium parasite, Dengue fever is a virus that has a variety of strains and can mutate easily, further preventing populations from developing immunity. This may help explain distribution of Malaria has reduced (from 140 countries reporting down to 88), while between 1950 and 2010 the number of countries reporting dengue fever has increased.", "Historically there has been more awareness of Malaria and the mosquito vector that spreads it. There was a Global Malaria Eradication program started in 1955 which used techniques such as DDT pesticide spraying, draining of swamps and distribution of bed nets. There was a 14% decrease in the population at risk between 1946 and 1975 indicating that the programs succeeded in eradicating the disease in certain areas. Dengue fever has not attracted the same attention and coordinated global elimination programs. In fact it is referred to as a \u2018neglected tropical disease\u2019.", "International trade and travel development (e.g. frequency of international flights) has increased rapidly since the 1950s which can transport infected people and the mosquito vectors that spread these diseases. However, another difference between Malaria and Dengue is that there is no effective antiviral treatment for Dengue. This means more infected individuals that are sick for longer and can spread the disease to others. By contrast, Malaria can be treated effectively with medicines such as Coartem or chloroquine which prevents the disease from spreading further (for both Dengue and Malaria, vaccinations have had minimal effectiveness to date).", "\u00a0", "(a) In the nucleus the gene/s for amyloid beta are copied onto an mRNA strand by RNA polymerase in the nucleus (Transcription). In the cytoplasm a Ribosome will undergo Translation of the mRNA strand into a string of amino acids.\u00a0 The tRNA molecules with anticodons that match the codons on the mRNA deliver amino acids to the ribosome that joins them together with peptide bonds. This creates a polypeptide chain or multiple chains which will be folded and modified to become amyloid beta protein.", "(b)(i) Alleles are alternative forms of a gene. While an individual can only carry 2 alleles for a gene, for many genes there are more than two different alleles for a gene in the population. For example clover has 7 different alleles for leaf pattern resulting in 22 different possible genotypes for leaf pattern.", "(ii) The e2, e3 and e4 alleles are each associated with a risk level for Alzheimer\u2019s, and the different alleles interact with each other to produce different risk levels. Allele e3 produces an average risk, while e2 seems to be a protective factor for this disease, reducing the likelihood of developing Alzheimer\u2019s by 40% (e2 is dominant over e3). Inheriting a copy of e4 increases the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s, even in combination with e2. Inheriting two copies of the e4 allele makes developing Alzheimer\u2019s 14.9 times more likely. Therefore, inheriting one or more e2 alleles reduces risk of Alzheimer\u2019s while one or more e4 alleles increases the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s developing.", "(c) Of the three groups, individuals with untreated Herpes Simplex Virus have a higher risk of dementia and this risk increases with the number of years that pass. After 11 years of follow up the cumulative risk of dementia for this group more than twice that of the group that was treated with antivirals. For those with HSV infection that was treated with antivirals the risk increases much more slowly and after 11 years the cumulative risk is 1. The risk of dementia still increases over time for those without any HSV infection but only very slightly (less than 0.5 after 11 years).", "(d) Infectious diseases are caused by a pathogen and can be passed from person to person while non-infectious diseases cannot be passed on to another person except through inheritance. None of the information provided in Q33 suggests that a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease symptoms can pass this disease on to another person through direct or indirect contact. However, the table in 33 (b) shows that the genotype of an individual has a very strong influence over whether an individual develops Alzheimer\u2019s. An individual with two harmful e4 alleles has 14.9 times higher risk of Alzheimer\u2019s and with two e2 alleles the disease is 40% less likely. This indicates it should be classed as a non-infectious disease.", "The graph in 33(C) shows there is an increased risk of dementia after Herpes Simplex Virus infection, but Alzheimer\u2019s is not the only cause of dementia, so it is unclear exactly how the graph relates to the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The graph also shows that even those that have not experienced HSV infection show a gradual increase in risk of dementia over time which indicates that HSV is not the only cause of the disease.", "A way to establish whether Alzheimer\u2019s is caused by a pathogen would be to use Koch\u2019s postulates which were developed in order to identify which microbes are associated with a specific disease. If the postulates were to be followed:", "In addition to genetic factors and HSV infection, Alzheimer\u2019s disease has also been associated with bacterial infection, gender, head injury and cholesterol levels. Therefore, there seem to be multiple factors that affect the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s and a single pathogen alone is not responsible. At this point Alzheimer\u2019s disease should be classified as a non-infectious disease.

Straight after my HSC exams, I spent a month or two relaxing, hanging out with friends, discussing our future and reminiscing on the past 13 years of schooling. In January, I received an offer to a Bachelor of Arts/Media & Communications course at Macquarie University. I knew that I wanted to take a gap year to travel and work as I felt I needed a break from studying and exams, so I deferred my offer for a year. I didn\u2019t want to waste my time in taking this gap year from university, so I was quite eager to find a job to gain specific skills and spend the remaining time planning my travels.", "Being the school captain, I was quite close to the teachers and administrative staff. Around sign out time, I casually mentioned that I was interested in finding a job after high school. I was particularly interested in securing a job related to the combination of Information Processes and Technology and Visual Arts, as I did quite well in these subjects at school. One of the office administrators, who was responsible for the marketing of the school, advised me that there was a job opening at a local printing and graphic design company. I got the job in November and started training in December that year. This experience was quite challenging as I had to learn many specific skills relating to design programs, and familiarise myself with new processes, such as working with large scale digital printers, in a very short period of time.", "The following six months included full-time work, plus a second job at nights, and numerous goodbyes to friends who had moved away to start university or work. During this time, I also planned a trip to the UK and Europe, which included booking flights, finding accommodation, applying for visas and researching places to visit. In July of my gap year, I left to live and work in London for six months.\u00a0I chose London as my base as it was close to other locations that I wanted to travel to.\u00a0 I stayed in a small shared flat in the north of London and experienced many challenges of living life abroad, including finding housemates, being away from family, establishing work and navigating my way around.", "I made the most of the last six months of my gap year by travelling to numerous cities around Europe including Barcelona, Paris, Reykjavik, Prague, Berlin and others; and gaining experience at numerous work places. Such experience ranged from waitressing/catering for some of the top hotels in London, to administrative/reception work at a university, a law firm and a bank. I was able to get a constant stream of work as I had signed up with 3 recruitment agencies, which would notify me when they had a suitable, temporary job opening. This was highly beneficial as it gave me flexibility in organising my travels around work.", "During this time, I was notified via an email from UAC that I would have to re-apply for university as I deferred my offer (this is necessary when you defer for a year). As I was already accepted into a course at Macquarie University, I reapplied through UAC, providing all my information from the previous year, and received an offer in September Round 1.\u00a0 When the six months were up, I flew home, packed the rest of my belongings and moved to Sydney where I started university.", "I found that taking a gap year was fantastic use of my time. Working before I began my gap year was a really great idea, not only because I was earning money, but also because I spent time learning new and practical skills that helped me a lot overseas. I was able to communicate better, know myself more, and be willing and ready to work. Travelling also helped in developing my own understanding of self, as well as building confidence in my own abilities. I was able to see, learn and experience new places, cultures, and food.

Spring is a season of new beginnings; including the season of blooming jacaranda trees which have always been linked to the beginning of the HSC period. As the purple flowers fall, the HSC also comes to an end for the class of 2016, but for the new and rising class of 2017 this is just the beginning.", "HSC is your final year of schooling. 13 years done and dusted. Now, take a moment to absorb that after your final exam in November 2017 you will have four whole months to travel, eat, and watch all 10 seasons of Friends without leaving your bed for anything but food! Although that is an excellent thing to look forward to, we all know Miley Cyrus was semi-correct when she said it \u201cain\u2019t about what\u2019s waiting on the other side, it\u2019s the climb\u201d.", "But before we plan for the end of your HSC year 2017, let\u2019s think about the good things that can come from this year. Your HSC year will be about facing new challenges; take this opportunity to embrace new ideas and open your mind to new perspectives. High school is just the beginning of your education and you should take full opportunity to use the resources around you in school, as well as, do some research yourself. Have a goal in mind for\u00a0the beginning of the year and each week or month, modify/ adapt that goal with the new things that\u00a0you have learnt along the way. Studying with a goal in mind is much more rewarding at the end of your HSC as you know you have planned and put all your efforts into achieving that goal.", "Lastly, enjoy your final year with your cohort. Year 12 is not all about study and finishing with a E4 on the certificate. It is also about cherishing those memories and friendships you have created the past 6 years in high school. Kill two birds with one stone and create study groups with your friends across\u00a0each subject\u00a0so that you are motivating and supporting each other. The last thing you want during your final year is feeling alone and stressed, and not being surrounded by a supportive environment.", "Unfortunately the matter of fact is, in the HSC year, a student\u2019s intelligence is based on 6 standardised exams. Sadly, this means that your final year of high school, in particular the months leading up to the almighty exams, will be filled with stressful late nights, post-exam stress eating and pre-exam study snacks (always craving those midnight chocolate snacks).", "BUT that\u2019s okay, you can treat this as a new challenge, take it as an opportunity to learn a little bit more about yourself. Take for\u00a0example, learning that you\u2019re a very goal driven person can result in studying more efficiently by setting\u00a0small goals to reach every day. You may learn that efficient study is not about memorising the content, rather it is about learning how to cope with stress and understanding what learning style best suits you. Once this is decided, you can be in your ultimate study zone!", "The most difficult part of completing the HSC is\u00a0feeling a little disconnected from friends and family. The feeling of being completely disconnected from others, closed\u00a0off by the walls of a bedroom, and spending every moment of the day studying, summarising notes, and preparing for the next assessment, means\u00a0that there is\u00a0little time to spend with friends and family.", "For example, feeling guilty when going out for dinner can become a huge issue, especially when eating should solely be a time of joy and relaxation. In order to maintain a balance between school and your social life,\u00a0organising a time-based schedule has proven to be a great way to eliminate unnecessary stress and ensure that you reward yourself. A typical weekend outing to a restaurant\u00a0could pan out like this:", "Sitting down and eating a meal with friends or family is usually a minimum of 60 minutes. In this amount of time half an exam paper could\u00a0be completed, highlighting the valuable study time lost when going out.", "However, throughout the ugly times, your\u00a0study life and personal life should always be in harmony with each other. It\u2019s important to be able to balance different aspects of your life! Remember, your friends and family will be your strongest support, so it is highly recommended to\u00a0use that to your advantage. Sit down and eat a meal with your family, so that after the meal you can get your siblings/parents\u00a0to help you memorise your biology notes.", "Overall, the HSC is\u00a0a tough and challenging year, but it\u2019s only one year of your life which you dedicate yourself to, in order to determine what path you take next. Take this as a new learning opportunity and we promise you, you will receive\u00a0the rewards afterwards in November 2017 once you complete\u00a0your final examination.

These ideas are exemplified in both Robert Gray\u2019s poems, ", "Diptych", " and ", "The Meatworks", ", and Matthew Thorne\u2019s short film, ", "Where Do Lilacs Come From", ". We see in these texts that discovery can only take place when our context challenges us, whether it is a change in context or the confronting nature of situational context itself. Only then can transformation occur.", "The contexts in which the interpersonal relationships of an individual take place are what fuel discoveries to occur. In Gray\u2019s ", "Diptych", ", elements of the persona\u2019s family life are embedded throughout, in particular the ongoing tension between the persona and his father. The father\u2019s dialogue, \u201cNothing whingeing. Nothing by New York Jews; / nothing by women,\u201d provides insight into the personality and character of the father. The anaphoric repetition of the harsh, despairing \u201cnothing\u201d portrays the father in his limited relationship with the persona, denoting the disconnect between the two and the persona\u2019s negative perceptions of his father as a result. However, the transformative powers of context are revealed after the character experiences the death of his father. It is only after this event that he discovers newfound feelings towards his father and reconsiders their past relationship.\u00a0 His death provokes a newfound acceptance and nostalgic fondness within the persona. The accident, \u201cmy pocket knife slid / sideways and pierced my hand \u2013 and so I dug with that one / into his ashes,\u201d is central to the persona\u2019s final emotional discovery. The mixing of his blood and his father\u2019s ashes symbolically unifies the two, highlighting the change in perspective that has occurred with this change in context. Therefore, it can be argued that an individual only truly discovers his feelings towards others when their relationship is challenged by a change in context. The experience of loss following the death of his father caused Gray\u2019s persona to reflect upon their past relationship and in doing so, he discovers feelings of clarity and acceptance that replaced past feelings of resentment and hostility. In other words, contextual experience has the potential to re-determine one\u2019s interpersonal relationships.", "\u00a0", "Similarly, Matthew Thorne\u2019s film ", "Where Do Lilacs Come From ", "explores the transformative powers of context. Much like Gray\u2019s ", "Diptych", ", Thorne depicts a change in context, in particular one that challenges an individual\u2019s personal beliefs, as a fast catalyst to self-discovery. The film follows Chris, an elderly man with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, as he struggles with the strain his condition places on his relationship with his son, Michael. This is symbolised by the reoccurring large spaces which separate the two characters in each frame, implying their emotional disconnect. A tracking shot of Chris chasing his younger self down a long, brightly lit corridor symbolises his desire to rediscover his lost memories. The responder is able to gauge from this Chris\u2019 perspective on\u00a0his condition. Senility is a burden on his identity. However, at the end of the film Michael discovers he is able to reconnect with his father by showing him home movies. The movies, displayed as hand-held camera footage with a muted colour palette evoke the same sentiment of nostalgic fondness that changed the persona\u2019s perspective in Gray\u2019s in ", "Diptych", ". The restorative experience of bonding is shown by a return to the metaphor of distance as the space between two characters is breached and the pair embrace. Not only does this show the characters re-discovering their love for each other, but the discovery they are still able to bond is a revelation within itself, one that allows Chris to view his Alzheimer\u2019s in a new context. He is able to challenge and transform his personal beliefs of his condition, coming to terms with his ageing as he rediscovers hope. Therefore, not only can a physical change in context shed new light on interpersonal relationships, but the way in which an individual contextualises their unique experience within their own mental framework can transform one\u2019s very identity.", "\u00a0", "However, a change in context is not the only determining factor of personal discovery. One\u2019s contextual environment alone has the immense ability to provide incentive for internal transformation through the process of discovery. In Gray\u2019s poem, ", "The Meatworks", ", the persona\u2019s existential contemplation of life and death is entirely due to his experience working at a slaughterhouse. The self-discovery commences at the start of the poem, as the persona reflects upon the other workers and their disregard for the lives of the animals. The compounded sensorial imagery of the passage, \u201cMost of them worked around the slaughtering / out the back / where concrete gutters / crawled off / heavily, and the hot, fertiliser-thick, sticky stench of blood / sent flies mad,\u201d establishes and sustains an oppressive sense of death. The use of alliteration in \u2018s\u2019 and \u2018h\u2019 creates a cacophony of emphatic sounds which combine to create a disturbing synesthetic response, illustrating the violent nature of death. It is this horrid setting that facilitates the persona\u2019s inner discovery of existential turmoil, and with it a renewed appreciation for life in all its forms. The symbolic gesture of hand washing in, \u201cI\u2019d scoop up the shell grit and scrub my hands, treading about through the icy ledges of the surf\u201d, illustrates the persona\u2019s desire for purification following his change in perspective. The use of personification in the poem\u2019s last line further conveys the persona\u2019s changing belief regarding the lives of animals: \u201cthe ways those pigs stuck there, clinging to each other\u201d. The persona discovers that in death, animals and humans are the same. This revelatory, existential experience perfectly exemplifies how the process of discovery is shaped by an individual\u2019s contextual environment. It shows the true transformational power of context to shape an individual\u2019s outlook and their very understanding of life.", "\u00a0", "In conclusion, it is highly evident that an individual\u2019s context, whether it be their physical environment, or the experience of a change in context, determines their process of discovery. Robert Gray\u2019s poems ", "Diptych ", "and ", "The Meatworks", ", and Matthew Thorne\u2019s short film ", "Where Do Lilacs Come From", ", all convey these ideas to a great extent. In these works responders come to understand how the relationship between context and individual experience define the discoveries which impact interpersonal relationships, personal identity and one\u2019s very perceptions of existence. Only when our context challenges us can we discover, and it is the impact of our discoveries that define who we are and our unique, individual experience.", "\u00a0", "\n", "\u00a0", "\u00a9 Matrix Education and www.matrix.edu.au, 2018.

You might check through your practice exams to see whether you remembered quotes correctly, whether you forgot a piece of analysis you intended to include or an important piece of context, and whether there are any areas where the logic or force of your argument weakens. It can be worthwhile typing previous written assessments: this will alert you to grammatical and syntactical errors, errors in argumentation, and also give you an indication of word count. Self-assessment is a valuable way of learning, so make sure if you\u2019ve gone to the effort of completing past papers, that you reap the rewards by checking over them.

He reveals to Matrix how he got into James Ruse in Year 11 and shares his experience in entering a Selective School after the general Year 7 intake.", "My name is Daniel Chang and I graduated from James Ruse Agricultural High School in 2008. I started my high school years at Fort Street High School where I spent four solid years from Year 7 to Year 10.", "\nIn Year 11, I transferred to James Ruse Agricultural High School. I first started attending Matrix when I was in Year 9 (2005) studying mathematics. I eventually picked up Physics in Year 11 and stuck it out until the HSC.", "I applied for admission into James Ruse Agricultural High School for Year 11. I had also applied the year before (for Year 10) but I was unsuccessful at the time. The admission process for James Ruse isn\u2019t too difficult. It requires filling out a form which requires information regarding academic results, co-curricular and extra-curricular involvements and a few other miscellaneous information. Fortunately, there isn\u2019t (there wasn\u2019t for me) an entrance exam for James Ruse which lifts a lot of stress and pressure from the admission process. It allowed me to shift my entire focus on my application. Having applied previously, it helped with the application process. You become more familiar with the admission process and for me, I felt more driven to achieve greater grades and to partake in greater extra-curricular activities at Fort Street High School to make my application look more appealing.", "I did some research on the transfer process for various high schools. I made sure that I had a thorough understanding on when the deadlines were, what was expected on the admission forms and to look out for any important information that would assist me in my application. Once I had access to the application form, I took a considerable amount of time answering each question carefully. Submitting well ahead before the deadline does help also, as some schools provided offers on a progressive basis.", "At first I thought it would be difficult trying to assimilate into a new environment. However, the existing students were friendly and extremely approachable. All schools share overlapping traits which really does help incoming students. Entering a new environment does not mean EVERYTHING is new. There are many characteristics of a new school that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be familiar with. For me, I found myself fully adapted to the new school in no time. The transition really isn\u2019t as bad as you think!", "Moving to a more academically focused school definitely has its benefits. Although people may perceive strong competition and pressure as negative aspects, I believe that it\u2019s good \u2013 particularly for students. Having peers achieving at a higher level provides motivation to study harder. Further, as students around you are smarter, more motivated and disciplined, they are also able to help you in your studies. I learnt more from my peers than I did from my teachers at school! A \u201cgroup study\u201d session becomes a learning experience, as all students are able to contribute to each other\u2019s knowledge.", "It may become slightly stressful when your marks aren\u2019t as high as fellow peers. For me personally, I really struggled in my first few months at James Ruse because my grades weren\u2019t up to scratch. However, it was during these tougher times where I was able to push myself harder and extend my goals to those of my peers, and even beyond.", "I definitely recommend it. Moving to a more highly ranked academic selective school changed my life and gave me an opportunity to befriend students who are not only gifted academically but are driven to succeed in all areas of their lives. The new students that I met really helped change my perspective on studies, life, sport and others. My closest friends today are the friends that I met at my new school and I cherish each and every one of them dearly. Further, my ability to study has been shaped and influenced by peers from my school, which I am still able to utilise today at university. Knowing how to study, setting high objectives and achieving at the highest are all traits and characteristics that are associated with good selective schools.", "Just be completely honest with your application. There\u2019s no point fabricating information so as to make your application look better. The realities and the pressures of a selective school are bound to expose your true abilities, or lack thereof. Be proactive in serving in the wider school community, through sport, debating teams, leadership bodies etc. to show that you are an all-rounder.

The amount of homework and extra learning required was enormous, which inevitably led to more stress, meaning it was vital to keep a positive mindset. Definitely easier said than done.", "Personally, I\u00a0found studying in groups to be an effective way of making studying less tedious. Working with friends allows you to not only stay on task, but also makes it easy to seek help for anything you are struggling with. Your teachers/tutors are also a useful resource, so you should ask as many questions as possible. Don\u2019t be shy.", "It\u2019s also important to understand that the HSC is a marathon and not a sprint, so it is vital that you pace yourself. Studying too much at the start will leave you burnt out towards the end. That said, it is important that you work consistently throughout the year, whilst ensuring that you take breaks to keep your mind fresh.", "You may also experience a few setbacks during the year, such as a bad result. It\u2019s important to learn from these mistakes, and use them\u00a0to improve next time. Keep in mind that the final HSC assessment is worth 50%, so one bad school assessment can be recovered from.", "Manage your time but be flexible", "You\u2019ve probably heard time and time again about the importance of closely sticking to a study schedule, but it\u2019s mentioned for a reason. Having a clear timetable and goals improves one\u2019s focus dramatically and is instrumental to assisting with procrastination.", "If you have fallen behind your initial schedule, perhaps due to over-planning, illness or neglecting the task at hand, don\u2019t beat yourself up over it. Instead, make adjustments. For example, after trial exams, I was a little burnt out and fell behind in my HSC study schedule. I was able to catch up to the schedule I had set by writing long response answers for Chemistry papers in dot-point form, rather than sentences. I also focused on the harder Maths questions that I hadn\u2019t encountered before, rather than completing questions that I already knew how to do.", "How you decide to save time depends on your areas of aptitude. If there are certain areas that you consistently do well in, then don\u2019t waste time re-learning something you\u2019re already proficient in. In short, time management involves more than simply devising a study schedule. It also involves being flexible and coming up with adjustments that can be implemented when deadlines can\u2019t be met.", "Importance of practice papers", "One thing you may notice is that textbook questions are often vastly different to those that appear in exams. For this reason, it is important to do as many practice papers as possible as this tests your understanding of the content, but also your ability to effectively express your knowledge under a time constraint. To get the most out of practice papers, it is important that you refer to marking guidelines/sample answers after you have completed a paper, and write down what you could have done to improve. It is also effective to have a peer or a teacher critique your answers for you. Creating a list of silly mistakes/common errors you make can also be useful in avoiding these errors.", "However, the problem in doing past papers is that whereas trial exam papers are easily available, those for Terms 1, 2 and 3 are difficult to find. I would suggest doing relevant questions in the trial HSC and final HSC papers for further practice. Matrix was helpful in that the homework questions are stylistically quite similar to what will be in your exams. Weekly quizzes and topic tests also allow students to test their knowledge and be critiqued by a teacher.", "A useful tip for pre-2012 HSC Mathematics Papers is segmenting your approach, particularly for Extension 2. First, perfect the first four questions until you can consistently get all of them right. Then move on to questions 5 and 6, then questions 7 and 8.

I believe notes should be prepared as the ultimate tool, such that a student can adequately answer any question in a variety of ways, solely using the information contained within their notes. You should also write your own notes as the process helps retain knowledge, even when the notes are not looked upon weeks or months later. My advice would be to complete your notes for each exam period two to three weeks prior to their start.", "Exam solutions were another integral part to my HSC experience.

As students begin to feel the stress of the HSC workload, they ditch their UMAT practice, and ultimately losing touch with their skills and the tough mindset required. Thus, I believe that students must treat the UMAT like a subject, allocating time each week to do drills, and in the 2 months before the exam, doing a two papers a week. Though the UMAT is one test, with regards to it helping you gain entry to a medical course, such as medicine at UNSW, it can be worth as much as your entire HSC year. Thus, it is only logical that you care as much about the UMAT as you do your ATAR.", "\u00a0", "The most difficult aspect of preparing for the UMAT is doing those long, 3 hour exam papers.

Time constraints are very tough in the UMAT, especially in the real exam where stress plays a large factor.", "\u00a0", "My final tip is that you should review every single drill/practice paper you do.

Feel free to expound upon your virtues and gathered accolades, but be prepared to discuss your failures as well. No medical student (other than yours truly) is perfect.

Honestly present your opinions, and don\u2019t limit yourself to what you believe the interviewers want to hear. Better to hold true to your convictions than be shackled to the whims of others.

If you have a good understanding of the skills necessary, and can communicate them clearly, you will be able to perform well in this style of interview.", "\u00a0", "The division of the interview into multiple stations with different interviewers has its pros and cons. Since each station is isolated, your performance in one station does not impact your performance in another.

Your mark is an aggregate of all stations \u2013 don\u2019t worry too much about one station! If you can leave the mistakes (and successes) of each station behind you, and approach the next with enthusiasm, you\u2019ll find yourself performing much better.

It may feel that each section is impersonal and rushed, which is never a comforting feeling.", "\u00a0", "The important part of this interview is to answer what the interviewers are asking for. With a time limit on every station, the interviewers need to get through a determined set of questions. The marks come from there \u2013 nowhere else. If you attempt to present yourself in a better light by going off on tangents about your recent Nobel Prize it is entirely possible that you will run out of time without having covered the aspects that they were actually looking for. No matter how impressed they may be, they cannot give marks for what you have missed. Be relevant, be concise.", "\u00a0", "My personal experience with these interviews is overall positive. The very first station I participated in was rather embarrassing, as I was nervous and stumbled all over the place. However, as I relaxed and got into the swing of things, the MMI seemed more a mysterious game show and less a stressful interview.

This is further dealt with in \u2018A Valediction: forbidding mourning\u2019, where the need for a tangible connection to the body even whilst searching for transcendentalism is shown through the similar extended metaphor of two lovers as the legs of a compass. The crux of Donne\u2019s Cartesian Dualism is centred around his fear of and desire for death, and this conflict, as demonstrated below, is ultimately what controls his poetry and metaphysics.", "\u00a0", "Nearly all of Donne\u2019s poetry deals with the overwhelming immediacy of death, which was an ever-present force in 17", "th", " century life. In Donne\u2019s poetry, he is torn between a fear of death and a desire for the life to come, where he would be united with God. Donne\u2019s littoral nature allows for the connection with his obsession with death to the issue of Cartesian Duality (see above).", "Example:", " \u2018Death Be Not Proud\u2019 places the persona at the crux of denial of and acceptance of death, and uses this to present the two different interpretations of the act: one of unnatural ending (which should be feared) and one of salvation (which should be revered). This is shown through the use of the sonnet form to mimic the formal argument of the persona. Lines 1-4 present a negative view of death through the modifiers such as \u201cdreadfull\u201d, and the imperative tone, which shows man\u2019s triumph over and ability to control death. However, at the end of the fourth line, there is a turn which presents a more balanced and, indeed, desirable view of death. This is established in lines 5-8 through the religious imagery of \u201csoules deliverie\u201d and the use of assonance and alliteration within clauses to slow the rhythm, creating a more tempered tone than the dissonance and imperative nature of the first four lines.", "At the end of line 8 there is another turn, this one moving backwards to the distress of the first section, showing the way in which the positive qualities of death remain unpalatable to the persona. Here, the use of assonance and extra rhyme allows the tempered tone of the previous section to remain, yet also draws on the critical views raised in the original section and allows them to be furthered. At the end of line 13 there is a drastic and critical turn, which moves away from any tempered understanding of the nature of death, using a declarative statement and personification \u201cthou shalt die\u201d to show that, for the persona, fear has won out over the possible religious pleasure.", "\u00a0", "Specifically, salvation from death through love or God. This, as a crucial concern in the 17", "th", " century, is at play throughout the poetry of Donne. For Donne, love\u2019s true nature is found in its connection with the divine.", "Example:", " \u2018A Valediction: forbidding mourning\u2019 shows that a transcendental love is necessary in order to be truly saved. This is evident in the use of ABAB rhyme scheme in the second stanza. The B rhyme is created through \u201cmove/love\u201d, which is a half-rhyme, and thus stands out from the perfect use of the scheme elsewhere. By juxtaposing moving and loving, and thus tying them together, Donne shows the need for physical and emotional distance to be travelled in order to transcend the confines of the flesh (see Cartesian Duality above).", "The repeated references to religious iconography and expressions in the later stanzas of the poem show the need for this movement to have a religious element to it. The enduring metaphor of man and woman as the two legs of a compass, drawn together by their relationship provides again an interesting dimension to the Cartesian Duality problem in Donne\u2019s poetry, whereby the poems stand on the edge between flesh and soul, and use elements of each to add to the other.", "Religious iconography refers to symbols and images that are commonly associated with a particular religion.", "\u00a0", "Our 9 week term course can help you get back on track with your marks.

Setting a goal will drive you to work harder and motivate yourself to achieve these goals. Having this self-motivation is really important, I set myself a goal of 99.65 which I thought I\u2019d never reach and aimed for it the entire year, I had my doubts, but ultimately, this really motivated me to work hard and caused me to persevere through all the stressful assessments. Despite not reaching this goal, I\u2019ve exceeded my expectations and actually come close to achieving it, something I\u2019d never imagined. Ultimately, you need to actually want to work hard, not to please others, but for yourself.", "Additionally, having a friend around who has a similar goal is useful as you can motivate each other when the other seems to have given up (the post-HSC trials periodwhere everyone seems to have given up \u2013 Don\u2019t let yourself/your friends slack off!!!!).", "When we\u2019re unengaged, studying becoming boring and tiresome, we tell ourselves, \u2018one more hour and I\u2019ll let myself watch the new episode of Doctor Who\u2019, but we procrastinate throughout and end up completing about 5 maths questions before turning on the television and doing 5 more.

YOU CANT CHEAT THE SYSTEM.", "To engage myself with studying I tried to make it fun \u2013 I added in diagrams whenever I could, I colour coded my work (after investing in really nice pens from Kinoyunka that would make me want to make notes) and I made lists and palm cards for myself. Doing these little activities made studying much more enjoyable and I found myself more willing to make notes and study. I found that in particular, using palm cards for essay-based subjects was especially helpful, writing down all the necessary content required under subheadings and trying to remember them. However I also found that I did not need to memorise it word for word and that if I had written my notes out at least twice I could recall everything during the exams, which was good as most teachers discourage pre-learnt essays during exams.", "You should also find out when and where you study the most effective, this will help with time management.", "\nI personally study best at night in my study room where there are fewer distractions around the house and it\u2019s silent, others may study better in the morning with a fresh head.", "\nHaving regular small study groups is also a good idea as sharing information and notes with others not only helps yourself understand your notes better but may give you new ideas on how to approach questions.", "Revising frequently \u2013 not just before exams.
