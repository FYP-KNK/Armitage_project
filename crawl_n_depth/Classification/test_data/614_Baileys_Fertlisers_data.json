A pH value of seven is neutral, meaning you have neither acidic nor alkaline soil.", "Knowing the pH value of your soil before planting is very important as it has a direct influence on the health of the plant.

Similarly, the nutrient phosphorous is available when the pH value is between 6 and 7. If a plant is placed into the wrong kind of soil it will be lacking in nutrients, promoting disease.

Soil pH is measured on a scale of one to 14. If your soil has a pH value of less than seven then you have acidic soil. If your soil has a pH value of greater than seven then you have alkaline soil. A pH value of seven is neutral, meaning you have neither acidic nor alkaline soil.", "Knowing the pH value of your soil before planting is very important as it has a direct influence on the health of the plant. Each plant has its own recommended soil pH value range. The reason for this is that soil pH affects the availability of nutrients and plants have different nutrient needs.\u00a0For example, the nutrient nitrogen, is readily available in soil when the pH value is above 5.5. Similarly, the nutrient phosphorous is available when the pH value is between 6 and 7. If a plant is placed into the wrong kind of soil it will be lacking in nutrients, promoting disease. In general, the best pH value range for soil is approximately 6 or 7 as this is the range in which most nutrients can be readily available.", "by anonymous in Palmyra, 28th September 2016", "Answer...", "To maximise your water use in the garden it is particularly important to improve your soil structure, mulch in warmer months and apply a wetting agent to hydrophobic soils.", "Baileys offer a range of Waterwise Approved products which are easily identifiable by their Waterwise Approved and Smart Approved Water Mark logos displayed on the packaging.

Similarly, the nutrient phosphorous is available when the pH value is between 6 and 7. If a plant is placed into the wrong kind of soil it will be lacking in nutrients, promoting disease.
