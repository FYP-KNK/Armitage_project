The good news is the proposed budget measures have increased this threshold up to $20,000 (GST Excluded). This $20,000 limit applies to each individual item.

There are a few items not deductible, including some horticultural plants and any software developed in-house by a business. Software purchased for business use, for example an account-keeping program, can be claimed.", "Under the original temporary accelerated depreciation measures during the global financial crisis, businesses were required to purchase new items of plant and equipment. We anticipate this to be the same under the new temporary measures, as only a purchase of new items of equipment will likely provide the economic stimulus required by the budget.", "Stand Alone Or Aggregate \u2014", "\u00a0The budget proposes that the accelerated depreciation is based on each item of equipment not an aggregate. This allows you take advantage of this measure for multiple separate items, so long as each item cost less than $20,000. For instance, if you purchased an autoclave for $15,000 and hand pieces for $10,000, your total spend during the financial year may have totalled $25,000, which is more than the threshold. The proposed measures, however, look at each purchase separately. So in this case, as both items were less than the $20,000 threshold, both are eligible for the full accelerated depreciation claim.", "What About Items Purchased Before The Budget \u2014", "\u00a0These will not be eligible for the accelerated depreciation claim.", "What About Stock & Materials \u2014", "\u00a0Stock and materials are specifically excluded from the proposed budget measure.", "Relevant Timeframes \u2014", "\u00a0This increase in threshold is applicable from 12 May 2015 (7:30pm) until 30 June 2017.

Data security and integrity", "Storing your data in remote servers may sound less secure than storing it in your own office, but the fact is that cloud service providers have greater capacity to ensure your data is safe and secure than you are likely to have in your business.

Reduced need for space and hardware", "The space required for physical files and for hardware components in a business can be considerable. With cloud services you only need a device and internet connection, saving valuable considerable space in your office. Less hardware also means lower costs on components and IT specialists.", "5. Save time and improve efficiency", "Using cloud services saves the time required to install software, to call on IT specialists for assistance, and to do those backups at the end of each day\u2019s work.

What happens with many of these practitioners is that they rely only on their clinical skills and knowledge of basic dental procedures, that they miss some critical steps and in the long run, make costly mistakes.", "In order to avoid such mistakes, it\u2019s important to first create a support system for yourself of people and institutions that have industry expertise and experience. These can be your most valuable assets, as they can guide you in making the right decisions and give you great advice based on first-hand experience. Your support system can include a local veteran practitioner, providers of\u00a0", "dental software in Australia", ", finance specialists and equipment specialists.

Two of the most significant drivers of revenue for any practice are active patients and new patient flow. In order to lure patients in and keep them with you, you will need to spend some time, effort and of course money to market your practice both internally and externally.", "Also, make sure to find an outside patient financing partner. This will ensure that your cash flow remains consistent, which you will need especially during the first few years of operation.", "If you\u2019re planning to build your own practice remember: it takes more than just expertise in basic dental hygiene and basic dental procedures to enjoy a long-running and profitable practice.
