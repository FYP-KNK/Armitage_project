This initial assessment takes place through vulnerability scanning.", "Using ", "Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)", " ratings, organisations can take the information that comes from the initial scan and address it in accordance with their risk management policies. During this prioritisation phase, those evaluating vulnerabilities identify how big the security threat is, whether the threat is likely to cause critical damages, and what the outcomes of responding to it are. At this stage, further information may also be gathered. For example, it might examine whether it\u2019s easy to exploit the weakness and how long it has been sitting in the network for. If the report shows that the weakness has been present for a while, that information can be used to identify why a flaw has gone undetected.", "The third stage of the process involves responding to vulnerabilities after prioritisation. In some cases, policymakers may decide that there\u2019s no need to respond to the weakness. This usually happens when it\u2019s found that the weakness can\u2019t easily be exploited, and if it can, it\u2019s unlikely there will be any significant harms.", "Another approach involves mitigating the risk. This usually happens when an organisation can\u2019t find an appropriate patch, or when a business feels as though there\u2019s a greater risk that responding will harm its daily operations.", "If a company finds that vulnerabilities are high risk, such as massive loss of data, it will respond to the report appropriately. In such instances, there\u2019s no questioning whether there\u2019s a need to find a patch or switch to a different program. Taking any other approach could result in critical damages to the network and the organisation itself.", "At the final stage, reporting takes place. An effective vulnerability management system doesn\u2019t just respond to a flaw and leave vulnerabilities there. Instead, it will generate a comprehensive report by extrapolating data that examine why vulnerabilities happened, what happened exactly, and how IT specialists can prevent it from happening again.", "If you\u2019re introducing a new service to your team, it\u2019s worth identifying what your policy is in advance.
