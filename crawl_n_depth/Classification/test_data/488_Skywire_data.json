First, they should be running newer versions of the OS that have strong security features. Also, for voice, a streamlined, non-screen device with a few buttons may be all that\u2019s needed, in conjunction with a Bluetooth headset and perhaps a scanner. \u201cE-commerce is forcing companies to look at ways of reducing operating costs in the warehouse, and because of that, I think people are going to be very smart about trying alternatives,\u201d says Deutsch.", "Consumer-based technology has had a \u201cbig influence\u201d on the rugged industrial device market, concurs Bruce Stubbs, director of supply chain marketing for Honeywell Safety & Productivity Solutions.
