Staff need to simultaneously convey the rareness of the opportunity, yet connect to the family\u2019s loved one.", "\u201cFamilies are experiencing such trauma in that moment, but we don\u2019t want them to look back and ask, \u2018Why wasn\u2019t I asked about donation?\u2019.

These include role plays of the complicated family conversation around organ and tissue donation.", "Importantly, there\u2019s also the OTA\u2019s national orientation program for the DonateLife network which needs to be delivered to a variety of professionals. \u201cWe designed the course to clearly describe the national program and how a new DonateLife team member\u2019s role fits within that bigger picture,\u201d said Amanda.", "\u201cA lot of the staff in DonateLife work in a normal ICU role within a hospital but also some dedicated time within the network\u2019s specialist role.

We\u2019ve used the platform\u2019s functionality to set up different group types so we can deliver enrolments. Once they attend one module, they\u2019re assigned to a group and then they get training delivered automatically that\u2019s specific to their needs.\u201d", "Notification features make it easier to communicate quickly across multiple groups, Amanda said, adding: \u201cWe recently did some redesign work on the platform and added new content, so just having that ability to reach everybody with the press of the button is excellent.

Amanda said: \u201cWe can assign administrator rights to people based in the state agencies \u2013 being able to do that has really cut back the workload and increased the accuracy of user profiles.", "\u201cWe\u2019re able to create new profiles when people join the network with different group identifiers and access. We don\u2019t necessarily know when staff come on board or leave individual hospitals, so giving that administrator right enables states to keep their own systems up-to-date at a more granular level.", "\u201cThey can then update the staff profiles, activate them and report on all their own staff training.\u201d", "Reporting tools ease the management workload for the OTA at state level. \u201cThe states can use the system to generate reports, plus look at activity at that local level.
