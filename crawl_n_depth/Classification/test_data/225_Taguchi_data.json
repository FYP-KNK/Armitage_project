Emails larger than this only partially load initially and require the recipient to initiate loading of the remainder by clicking on a link at the bottom. Aside from the potential impact on subscriber engagement statistics, any personalisation or dynamic content not presented on the first loading may have been completely wasted.", "Email size has a habit of growing over time - not just because people add more images and content, but because templates are continually altered with new functionality and code (e.g. dynamic content and business rules around personalisation) that over time inherently increase the size of the email.", "During testing, always check the size of the email when it arrives in your inbox. If it's too big, look at the content, and the construct of the email template code and remove any legacy code.", "We always recommend trying to keep the maximum size to under 100kb where possible.", "(iii)  Mobile specific image size", "Your emails can look great with Hi-DPI sized images on modern devices", "Most mobiles today have high resolution (Hi-DPI) displays. Therefore a 750x1334 screen size is in reality 2x that (1516x2668). That means your images should be too. A 320px wide mobile hero image should be 640px in dimension (with as much compression as possible to keep the file size down without sacrificing image quality). In the email itself, it will scale down to 320px, but Hi-DPI displays will use those extra pixels to display a much sharper and blur-free image.", "3. Get to the point", "Marketing emails, no matter how good their content, are not like print publications. Many of your subscribers will often only read the subject line and scan the above the fold portion of your emails before determining whether they will read the rest or click through for more.

", "Be descriptive but succinct enough in the email so the subscriber is clear on the subject and what they need to do next. For instance, it needs to be relevant and enticing so that they want to read the full content on the website.

Therefore, building conversion metrics into your A/B or multivariate testing algorithm is worth considering if your system has that capability. ", "In the example above, greater ROI was not easily identifiable from reviewing standard click and open rate metrics. Understanding the impact on ROI is what opens the door to a range of actionable future communication options and tactics.

For example, Taguchi\u2019s Smart Template\u00ae system is a content management environment specifically designed for email creation. This means that the email client rendering rules are programmed into the template modules themselves and don\u2019t have to be tested each time the template is used, no matter how the modules are moved around to accommodate different designs and layouts.  This is because you are using the functionality and logic of the purpose-built modules and not manually editing the HTML code. Systems using this type of content management template approach usually only need to be tested when major changes are made to new email client versions or new modules and logic are added to the template", "A common approach amongst many other email platforms, particularly older ones, is the use of HTML editing modules where email content is populated by editing the HTML code either directly or via some form of provided WYSIWIG (what you see is what you get) design tool within a pro forma layout (i.e. a template). With these types of systems, even small changes or additions to the HTML as a result of editing content can \u201cbreak\u201d the email design in certain email clients. This HTML document editing approach usually means that the email needs to be tested for rendering consistency frequently, possibly prior to each deployment depending on the extent of the changes each time.

", "Online rendering testing tools are useful because they're quick, relatively cheap, and give you a broad spectrum of tests. Many of these are emulating native email client environments and use intelligent screen-capture to replicate what your email would look like in a particular native email client; they're not actually showing you the email in the native email client itself. In our experience there's no substitute for testing email templates in native environments, even if this is done periodically in-line with major email client updates.", "Many email clients block images in messages either because that's their default setting or because the recipient has configured it that way. This means your important images may not be displayed to the recipient. If this is the case, the readable content of your email such as subject lines, text headlines and body copy have to do the heavy lifting to compensate and entice the reader to override their settings and \u201cdisplay images\u201d. Despite this, there's no guarantee the recipient will load the images leaving your beautiful artwork to live invisibly in the ether. Therefore, the use of alternative text (i.e. alt text) provides a back-up to at least ensure the image message is conveyed when images are turned off.", "Therefore, it\u2019s wise to avoid embedding critical messages solely in images by having a fall-back using alt-tags which display even with images turned off.", "As email clients improve and become more sophisticated, we're seeing an increasing use of gif animation as opposed to static images in emails. Terrific, who doesn\u2019t love colour and movement?", "Whilst this can improve the recipient experience, not all email clients will display this animation.

Unfortunately, size really does matter", "When it comes to email marketing, believe it or not, size matters a lot.  This is because your email has to be delivered to a range of different inbox environments, some that are old, some with viewing panes open, some closed, some with kb size restrictions, others that struggle with format consistency when emails are too long etc. That\u2019s on top of ensuring your email renders correctly in the main desktop, webmail and mobile email clients.

That is, most of the content will usually be displayed in the client\u2019s default setting.", "A standardised size - makes it easier to control the design across multiple email clients. Having a fluid email width is often complicated to tame on older legacy email clients such as Outlook. A strict 600px wide email allows you to position items more accurately and ultimately have more control over the design across an array of email clients.", "(ii) Limit the size of your email (kb)", "Email kilobyte size (kb) can often be more important than the email pixel width.

Emails larger than this only partially load initially and require the recipient to initiate loading of the remainder by clicking on a link at the bottom. Aside from the potential impact on subscriber engagement statistics, any personalisation or dynamic content not presented on the first loading may have been completely wasted.", "Email size has a habit of growing over time - not just because people add more images and content, but because templates are continually altered with new functionality and code (e.g. dynamic content and business rules around personalisation) that over time inherently increase the size of the email.", "During testing, always check the size of the email when it arrives in your inbox. If it's too big, look at the content, and the construct of the email template code and remove any legacy code.", "We always recommend trying to keep the maximum size to under 100kb where possible.", "(iii)  Mobile specific image size", "Your emails can look great with Hi-DPI sized images on modern devices", "Most mobiles today have high resolution (Hi-DPI) displays. Therefore a 750x1334 screen size is in reality 2x that (1516x2668). That means your images should be too. A 320px wide mobile hero image should be 640px in dimension (with as much compression as possible to keep the file size down without sacrificing image quality). In the email itself, it will scale down to 320px, but Hi-DPI displays will use those extra pixels to display a much sharper and blur-free image.", "3. Get to the point", "Marketing emails, no matter how good their content, are not like print publications. Many of your subscribers will often only read the subject line and scan the above the fold portion of your emails before determining whether they will read the rest or click through for more.

", "Be descriptive but succinct enough in the email so the subscriber is clear on the subject and what they need to do next. For instance, it needs to be relevant and enticing so that they want to read the full content on the website.

Here\u2019s why (in no particular order and not exhaustive):", "Likewise, we see examples where A/B tested subject lines have shown emails with lower open rates can result in greater ROI. The post campaign conclusion was that the more reflective the subject line was of the actual email content, the better the conversion, despite the open rate being significantly lower than the other emails in the test. Therefore, building conversion metrics into your A/B or multivariate testing algorithm is worth considering if your system has that capability. ", "In the example above, greater ROI was not easily identifiable from reviewing standard click and open rate metrics. Understanding the impact on ROI is what opens the door to a range of actionable future communication options and tactics. ", "Reviewing the interrelationship between your own metrics will provide you with actionable insights. Tracking ROI is therefore an essential part of the mix. Importantly this knowledge is valuable IP your industry competitors don\u2019t have access to.", "Therefore when it comes to generic industry reports, even with more granular analysis, I\u2019d question how useful they would be to your organisation other than for curiosity purposes. This is why we recommend you reference these reports with caution, and why we never recommend paying for them.

This means that the email client rendering rules are programmed into the template modules themselves and don\u2019t have to be tested each time the template is used, no matter how the modules are moved around to accommodate different designs and layouts.  This is because you are using the functionality and logic of the purpose-built modules and not manually editing the HTML code. Systems using this type of content management template approach usually only need to be tested when major changes are made to new email client versions or new modules and logic are added to the template", "A common approach amongst many other email platforms, particularly older ones, is the use of HTML editing modules where email content is populated by editing the HTML code either directly or via some form of provided WYSIWIG (what you see is what you get) design tool within a pro forma layout (i.e. a template). With these types of systems, even small changes or additions to the HTML as a result of editing content can \u201cbreak\u201d the email design in certain email clients.

Many of these are emulating native email client environments and use intelligent screen-capture to replicate what your email would look like in a particular native email client; they're not actually showing you the email in the native email client itself. In our experience there's no substitute for testing email templates in native environments, even if this is done periodically in-line with major email client updates.", "Many email clients block images in messages either because that's their default setting or because the recipient has configured it that way. This means your important images may not be displayed to the recipient. If this is the case, the readable content of your email such as subject lines, text headlines and body copy have to do the heavy lifting to compensate and entice the reader to override their settings and \u201cdisplay images\u201d. Despite this, there's no guarantee the recipient will load the images leaving your beautiful artwork to live invisibly in the ether. Therefore, the use of alternative text (i.e. alt text) provides a back-up to at least ensure the image message is conveyed when images are turned off.", "Therefore, it\u2019s wise to avoid embedding critical messages solely in images by having a fall-back using alt-tags which display even with images turned off.", "As email clients improve and become more sophisticated, we're seeing an increasing use of gif animation as opposed to static images in emails.

You\u2019ll have to test it and see.", "How you do this and how often will depend on the email marketing platform you\u2019re using and how old the template is relative to new email clients in the market. For example, Taguchi\u2019s Smart Template\u00ae system is a content management environment specifically designed for email creation. This means that the email client rendering rules are programmed into the template modules themselves and don\u2019t have to be tested each time the template is used, no matter how the modules are moved around to accommodate different designs and layouts.  This is because you are using the functionality and logic of the purpose-built modules and not manually editing the HTML code. Systems using this type of content management template approach usually only need to be tested when major changes are made to new email client versions or new modules and logic are added to the template", "A common approach amongst many other email platforms, particularly older ones, is the use of HTML editing modules where email content is populated by editing the HTML code either directly or via some form of provided WYSIWIG (what you see is what you get) design tool within a pro forma layout (i.e. a template). With these types of systems, even small changes or additions to the HTML as a result of editing content can \u201cbreak\u201d the email design in certain email clients. This HTML document editing approach usually means that the email needs to be tested for rendering consistency frequently, possibly prior to each deployment depending on the extent of the changes each time.  ", "As a minimum we recommend the following email client testing: ", "If you don\u2019t have direct access to a wide variety of native email client environments, then you can use online rendering tools like Litmus to get an idea of what your email will look like. ", "Online rendering testing tools are useful because they're quick, relatively cheap, and give you a broad spectrum of tests. Many of these are emulating native email client environments and use intelligent screen-capture to replicate what your email would look like in a particular native email client; they're not actually showing you the email in the native email client itself. In our experience there's no substitute for testing email templates in native environments, even if this is done periodically in-line with major email client updates.", "Many email clients block images in messages either because that's their default setting or because the recipient has configured it that way. This means your important images may not be displayed to the recipient. If this is the case, the readable content of your email such as subject lines, text headlines and body copy have to do the heavy lifting to compensate and entice the reader to override their settings and \u201cdisplay images\u201d. Despite this, there's no guarantee the recipient will load the images leaving your beautiful artwork to live invisibly in the ether. Therefore, the use of alternative text (i.e. alt text) provides a back-up to at least ensure the image message is conveyed when images are turned off.", "Therefore, it\u2019s wise to avoid embedding critical messages solely in images by having a fall-back using alt-tags which display even with images turned off.", "As email clients improve and become more sophisticated, we're seeing an increasing use of gif animation as opposed to static images in emails. Terrific, who doesn\u2019t love colour and movement?", "Whilst this can improve the recipient experience, not all email clients will display this animation. Some will actually display a still image made up of one of the frames, typically the first frame.
