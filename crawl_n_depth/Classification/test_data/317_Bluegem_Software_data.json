Initially you can just make out the sub-sea station at the bottom. Eventually, the ocean is completely removed. The vessels in the harbour float like space ships in mid-air and there, lying on the seabed you can see every detail of the sub-sea station. Now that we have a clear picture of the geography of our operating area we can return the water. But we're still under water. We're seeing the same picture as the ROV, but we can see the ROV too and track its path to the sub-sea station.", "Suddenly, a snow flurry appears out of nowhere and the winds pick up. All the vessels in the harbour are pitching and rolling while you concentrate on trying to maintain a level platform to safely deploy your ROV.

Ensure your existing data continues to be reportable", "3.

Now I can share the most important lessons to help you transition to your new system with minimal scar tissue.", "I stress should because that really depends on your prospective new vendor. To put it simply, let\u2019s say you\u2019ve been consistently reporting compliant data, in accordance with a nationally accepted standard like AVETMISS, HEIMS or HEPCAT. Then we can reasonably assume your reported data is accurate and compliant.", "Any vendor worth his salt should be able to effortlessly import compliant data into their hopefully, \u2018compliant\u2019 system \u2013 you would think!

How can you be sure your most recent data is compliant?", "In this case use the NCVER AVS tool to test the latest records you want imported. You can also run test submissions on just about any state or national RTO reporting system. But it\u2019s in your interest to be as confident as you can be in the quality of your data.", "This is common with Enterprise RTOs, where the RTO side of the business is not always the number-one focus. If you deliver a mix of accredited and non-accredited staff training then you won\u2019t benefit from any automated data-migration tools that your vendor may have created.", "But here again, your prospective new vendor can still play an important role in minimising your data-migration costs.", "A good vendor will have thought through the process and come up with a set of import Templates in Microsoft Excel for example. They will have developed tools to import data from those templates. In theory, all you should have to do is export data from your existing system and copy-paste or rename columns to be consistent with the vendor\u2019s templates.", "Again I emphasise the word should. There are other considerations, e.g. you might even use exactly the same column names as the vendor, but your data types or formats may be different. Also, the vendor may have \u201cimport validation rules\u201d that result in your data being rejected, example: expected date format is: 23/05/2011 vs. your date format: 23rd MAY 2011.", "There are systems available that enable you to map your column headers to the vendors and that cater for a wide variety of import data types and formats.", "Again this is a common requirements, particularly if you\u2019re an Enterprise training provider, registered or not. Often you need to collect data that is specific to your industry or your organisation that you won\u2019t find readily in a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system.", "And once again, vendors who\u2019ve thought about these problems can still offer solutions that minimise your data-migration costs. I handled this scenario by building a bank of spare fields with different data types: free text, true/false, date-time, number, etc\u2026 These fields can be assigned and relabelled by my client. For example, a common requirement for public safety officers is \u2018currency in and accredited role or capability\u2019.", "This requires ongoing professional development and assessment, say annually. The feature requires a \u2018currency expiry date\u2019 field. The client was able to utilise one of the spare date fields which was relabelled to \u201cCurrency Expires\u201d. These fields can be (optionally) included in reports and searches. This type of preparation provides a zero-cost implementation in what would otherwise have been an expensive customisation project.", "Mismatches can go both ways of course. What if the vendor requires a data item that your existing system doesn\u2019t provide?", "A good vendor will enable any mandatory data to be defaulted. So if your current system doesn\u2019t provide a necessary piece of data then you can set an appropriate default value to satisfy your new system. Obviously since you\u2019ve never captured this data in the past it\u2019s not important to you, so a default value that satisfies the new system is generally a good option.", "You\u2019d probably prefer to have all of your data in one system, rather than having to work with a separate archive system that holds all your completed activity and transfer only active records to your new system.", "But I\u2019ve had requests from RTOs who want to \u2018park\u2019 the old stuff and keep their new system light and clean.", "In a perfect world both should be possible. But if you decide to archive your old data keep these two points in mind.", "1. If you collect state funding and need to report monthly, e.g. to DET Queensland, Skills Vic or RAPT in WA your state training authority will be looking for consistency across the current reporting year. Students who were reported as completed last month are generally expected to again be reported as completed in the current month.", "If this is your situation then you should consider any training activity in the current year as active and reportable.", "2. In my experience the most common call on archived data is for lost or expiring certificates. If your old system regenerates certificates from original data then you should create re-printable backups, e.g. PDF copies of all certificates before archiving the old system.", "If you choose to migrate all the data the new system should handle completed vs. current training activity differently. For example, you probably don\u2019t want your daily admin activities bogged down with large volumes of completed records that you\u2019ll rarely need to access.", "A good system separates the data so that you can focus on current and future activity, safe in the knowledge that you can easily access completed activity if and when you need to.", "This rule may not apply in Enterprise and Public Safety scenarios where it may be common to access a person\u2019s profile and training history for HR and incident-deployment considerations.", "Your current system may store these as either data or as documents on a file server. Either way there should be a facility to export them as documents. Of these, the most important are your issued certificates. As an RTO you\u2019re obliged to keep copies of these.", "As a general rule templates are neither as numerous or as critical as issued certificates and if you had to recreate these from scratch I a new system that would not constitute a major melt-down. But where possible transfer them to the new system and get pdf copies of your templates so that they can be recreated in the new system if necessary.", "Course documentation, online learning packages (SCORM / xApi), Assessment Tools should all be transferrable to your new system, if supported! By now you will probably have established that if your business needs these documents and your prospective new system doesn\u2019t support them then you have a needs-gap that should be addressed.", "Data Migration is not something you should be scared of. In fact, it\u2019s a decision you\u2019ll have to make sooner or later when migrating to a new system.", "An important step in your preparation is selecting a vendor who has done the necessary
