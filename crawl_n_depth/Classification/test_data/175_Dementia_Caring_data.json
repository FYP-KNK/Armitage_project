The symptoms in question can include:", "As a dementia care Central Coast solution we have a wealth of knowledge on these conditions. Dementia will often be caused when the brain has been damaged by a disease or condition. For instance, a stroke is one of the main causes but it\u2019s certainly not the only one. It\u2019s also possible that dementia occurs due to the aging brain. Indeed, dementia does become more common and likely as we get older. By the time you reach eighty, the chances of you showcasing some signs of dementia are alarmingly common. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to understand the options for dementia carer support in the Central Coast.", "Why Do You Need Professional Dementia Care Services", "You might be wondering why you should opt for professional support for your loved one who is suffering from dementia. First, it\u2019s important to think about the dangers that someone with dementia can bring for themselves and others. As mentioned, one of the key signs and symptoms of dementia is issues with memory. Short term memory is more likely to be impacted than long term memory and it can have a significant effect. It can mean that individuals struggle to remember tasks that they are in the middle of completing. For instance, it\u2019s possible that someone with dementia could be pouring a cup of tea. They could forget they are completing this process in the middle of pouring. This could lead to boiling hot water being poured on their hands instead. If they are cooking they might forget to turn the oven off or forget the hob is switched on. This is one of the reasons why dementia care services central coast residents trust is going to be the right decision. You need to keep your loved one safe.", "There are also long term memory issues that can have an impact as well. A person with dementia may forget who you are. These lapses in memory can last for minutes, hours, days or weeks. As well as being painful for you, it can again lead to a dangerous situation. They may be confused, angry or frightened and react violently to your presence. This can be incredibly difficult to deal with in a way that is safe. It could also put other vulnerable people in the family at risk, including children.", "Another potential risk comes from the side impacts of dementia. Dementia may also impact the motor control of an individual. This makes them more prone to slips, trips, falls and general injuries. This is why it\u2019s important that they are being cared for in the right environment.", "Ultimately, these issues mean that an individual with dementia could need constant, 24/7 care and attention. That could be necessary to ensure that they do not get injured or suffer an accident. Attempting to provide this support will put pressure on you and cause strain on your personal or professional life. It\u2019s true to say that looking after someone with dementia is often a full-time job. That\u2019s why you should make sure that you are leaving it to the professionals with an in-home dementia care central coast solution.", "Is In-Home Care The Right Choice", "You could be wondering whether in-home dementia care Central Coast services is the right decision. In most cases, this is going to be the case and there are a few reasons for this. One of the main reasons why you should select in-home care is that it provides an environment that your loved one is comfortable and familiar with. Research does suggest that patients in unfamiliar environments suffering from dementia can experience greater difficulties.", "A familiar environment may actually help to trigger key memories. It can also ensure that they are able to navigate more effectively with some level of independence. As well as this, your loved one will find being at home less stressful. When they do have a memory lapse or they phase out, it can be comforting if they are in their own home and own bed, rather than a live-in facility. Loved ones will often also resist going into care because they want to keep some form of independence. They don\u2019t want to give up their home and at Dementia Caring we don\u2019t believe they should have to. Instead, our aim is to provide the full support dementia patients require in an environment where they are completely comfortable with their surroundings.", "Do be aware that a home environment can still be effectively altered to ensure it is safe and secure for patients.

Do be aware that it\u2019s unlikely a loved one will notice this themselves. Instead, it will be up to you to recognize the key traits and signs.", "One of the earliest signs of dementia is always going to be issued with memory. Those caring for a person with dementia always remember the first sign of an issue was something simple. For instance, a loved one might constantly be forgetting where they put their keys. A more worrying sign would be if they begin to forget where they live or they start to show signs of phasing out.", "Phasing is a common sign and it\u2019s exactly as it sounds. You could talk to your loved one when suddenly, they phase-out of the conversation completely. They will snap back after a couple of minutes and have no idea what you were talking about.

Some people are forgetful. However, if this marks a significant change in an individual\u2019s memory, it is worth paying attention to.", "How Fast Does Dementia Progress And Develop", "As a top provider of dementia care central coast services, we get asked this question a lot. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no set answer. There\u2019s actually 100 different types of dementia and they all progress at different rates. Some people will notice a significant level of decline in a matter of years. Others can take decades before they see noticeable changes. This makes it difficult to know when you should arrange dementia home care for your loved one.", "The key point here is to make sure that you are keeping a check on the condition. When the signs begin to become apparent, you need to keep a record. Make sure that you understand if there have been any changes. A key point to consider is whether a loved one can live without support. Unfortunately, dementia will always reach the point where this is no longer a safe option. Ideally, dementia home care Central Coast services should be implemented before an accident or issue occurs. This can be possible if you keep a check on the condition as it continues to develop.", "There are various different stages of dementia. It\u2019s the later stages where professional dementia care at home will become essential and caring for a parent with dementia at home yourself will be near impossible. Stage one is marked by the lapses that we mentioned above. Again, there is always a fast recovery and this means that they are difficult to spot.", "Stage two will lead to a patient forgetting key facts and details. However again, there will likely be a rapid recovery and this can be mistaken for typical issues with memory.", "Stage four is the point where care is often introduced. At this stage, individuals are no longer able to manage their own affairs and they will need some form of support. However, it\u2019s important to note they may not require constant attention.", "By stage seven an individual is often completely disoriented. They will typically experience a severe loss of speech. They will need constant care and support for even the most typical functions.", "If you require the best dementia care central coast solution, make sure that you contact us today.

In basic terms, dementia is a form of damage to the brain. However, because there are so many different parts of the brain, this means that there are many different types of dementia \u2013 depending on the part of the brain that has been impacted and the way that it has been affected. In fact, did you know that there are more than 100 types of dementia? This is something a lot of people do not realise. In fact, they assume that dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s is the same thing. It is understandable why you may assume that this is the case. However, Alzheimer\u2019s is simply a form of dementia. It is the most common form, accounting for six in every 10 cases of dementia. However, there are lots of different forms of dementia, all of which have a different impact on a person. This needs to be taken into account when providing care for someone with this illness. For example, if someone suffers from Lewy body dementia, it is not uncommon for them to become aggressive. They also need regular reassurance because they become disorientated and confused easily. However, for someone with Alzheimer\u2019s, it is more likely for the person to have trouble when making sense of place, orientation, and time. For someone who does not have any experience in caring for someone with dementia, it can be difficult to understand how the type of dementia they are experiencing has an impact on their symptoms and their needs. However, this is something you do not need to worry about when you have the assistance of a dementia carer Melbourne from Dementia Caring.

The person may be anxious and they will probably be experiencing challenges in the workplace.", "Stage 4 ", "\u2013 If no one has realised that the person is suffering yet, then they will be stage 4. This is because it becomes impossible for the individual to manage their affairs on their own.

This part of the illness can be the most difficult for family members to cope with. It is important to recognize that your relative or friend still loves you; it is simply the impact that the condition is having on the memory part of their brain. Dementia sufferers experience issues with short-term memory especially, and this is why a lot of people think they are in a period of 20 or 30 years ago, for example. While it can be difficult, it is best not to correct the person. Don\u2019t try to get them to be in the present or ask them if they remember certain memories.

But it is only recently with the rise of the aging population that their attention has turned to Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 one of the most destructive diseases a person can get.", "Alzheimer\u2019s is believed to be caused by the slow accumulation of a specific type of plaque in the brain. What is interesting about this plaque is how it resembles the plaques that build up in people\u2019s arteries. There\u2019s evidence to suggest that a similar process is underway in the brain tissue of those who go on to develop Alzheimer\u2019s as there is in those who get heart disease. Certain dietary patterns foster the formation of plaques which then go on to affect the functioning of the brain, causing progressively worsening symptoms that eventually lead to death.", "When it comes to heart disease, we know the dietary culprits: meat, processed meats, cheese, butter, and eggs. These are the primary drivers of the disease, thanks to their high saturated fat content and pro-inflammatory effect on artery walls. Other drivers include processed foods and sugary food, though to a much lesser degree. In Alzheimer\u2019s it\u2019s a similar story: high levels of cholesterol in the blood appear to fuel the development of the disease, leading some to wonder whether the condition is the \u201cheart disease of the brain.\u201d More research is needed to confirm this, but as it stands it appears diet plays a significant role in the development of the disease.", "How big an effect does diet play? Well if you look at data from Japan, you find that the rate of Alzheimer\u2019s has more than doubled in the last fifty years. In that time, consumption of animal foods went up by more than 500 percent, leading some to wonder whether animal food consumption was a primary driver of the condition. Practically every within-country study conducted to date, whether in Poland, the US, Ireland or Taiwan, come up with similar findings: meats, high-fat dairy, and sweets appear to increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, and whole plant food consumption seems to reduce the risk.", "If you use home care services in Sydney, then the good news is that there are dozens of healthful foods that you can choose to lower your risk of the disease effectively. If you use home care, you can use home care services to provide you with the foods that help to fight Alzheimer\u2019s and prevent the condition from taking over your life, or that of a loved one.", "Let\u2019s take a look at some of the foods that fight Alzheimer\u2019s best.", "Raw Leafy Greens", "Raw leafy greens are perhaps the healthiest food on the planet. Leafy greens contain more nutrients per calorie as a group than practically any other food. But can they help to fight Alzheimer\u2019s?", "Many people in home care in Australia have this neurodegenerative disease, and they need strategies to fight it. Leafy greens may offer a solution. Green vegetables, like kale, rocket, and beet greens are high in a compound called nitrate. Nitrates are beneficial because when we chew on them, they react with the bacteria in our mouths and turn into nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator. People using home care services can, therefore, use leafy greens to help their arteries open up and become more elastic.", "As we discussed earlier, this could help the brain. The more that arteries can open up and stretch out, the better will be the blood supply to the brain, and the healthier people in elderly home care will be. When blood vessels function as they should, there will be no opportunity for damaging plaques to build up and lead to the onset of disease.", "Whole Grains", "Why might whole grains be so beneficial to people with Alzheimer\u2019s in Australian home care? The main reason has to do with the beneficial effect that whole grains have on the microbiome.", "When you eat whole grains, especially \u201cintact\u201d whole grains \u2013 like a whole grain of brown rice or a whole wheat berry \u2013 then you provide raw materials that your gut bacteria can use to grow. When nutrition scientists investigate the poop of people who eat a lot of intact grains, they find that the bacteria use the grains as a habitat, filling their interior with colonies.", "What does this have to do with people in ", "home care in Sydney with Alzheimer\u2019s", "? Well, it turns out that when gut bacteria feed on whole grains, they start churning out beneficial compounds, like butyrate, that are then absorbed into the body. Butyrate then travels up to the brain and has an anti-inflammatory effect, reducing the chances of the body creating dangerous plaques in the first place.", "There are other mechanisms through which whole grains may have a beneficial impact on Alzheimer\u2019s. In fact, many country-level studies show that when populations increase their intake of whole grains, rates of Alzheimer\u2019s fall.", "Legumes", "Should people using in-home care in Sydney eat beans to combat Alzheimer\u2019s? The answer is a firm \u201cyes.\u201d", "Legumes, which includes beans, chickpeas, and lentils, are perhaps the most underrated food on the planet. Nutrition scientists know that legumes offer powerful health-promoting effects to people receiving in-home care support in Sydney, but these benefits are not widely known.", "One of the main benefits of legumes appears to be their remarkable ability to control blood sugar. High levels of sugar in the blood can damage neurons and lead to degenerative brain conditions, like Alzheimer\u2019s, but beans are superfoods when it comes to reducing the blood sugar spike that comes after a meal.", "Scientists think the reason for this is that beans contain a large amount of fiber and resistant starch. Resistant starch is a kind of carbohydrate that the body struggles to digest. Most resistant starch makes it down to the colon where it\u2019s gobbled up by specialist gut bacteria (who then churn out beneficial compounds). When eaten with other foods, beans have a remarkable ability to lower the overall blood sugar impact of the meal, which is why people should try to eat them as often as possible.", "People using home care in Sydney who eat beans can benefit further from something called the \u201csecond meal effect.\u201d The second meal effect is the observation that if you eat legumes for lunch, they carry on protecting your body at dinner time. Beans are so remarkable at lowering blood sugar that scientists have observed that if a person eats them for lunch and then has a bean-free meal for dinner, their blood sugar spike after their dinner will be lower than it would have been had they not eaten any legumes for lunch.", "Blueberries", "Berries are widely regarded by nutrition scientists to be the healthiest fruits you can eat, thanks to the fact that they are packed with beneficial phytonutrients.", "People with Alzheimer\u2019s using Australian home care services could potentially slow the progression of the disease by eating more berries, especially blueberries.", "Berries are high in a beneficial phytonutrient called anthocyanidins. These anthocyanidins are the pigments that give berries their distinctive colors. In general, the darker the berry, the more of these compounds are present. Berries use anthocyanidins to protect themselves from the sun\u2019s rays, helping to keep the sugars inside intact. But humans can appropriate this plant defense mechanism for their own ends.", "When people eat berries, their brains benefit. Phytonutrients in the berries, like anthocyanidins, cross the blood-brain barrier and help to exert an anti-inflammatory effect on the surrounding brain tissue. When scientists tested people who ate berries daily, they found that their brains aged more slowly and that they looked like those of much younger people. People in Australia home care, therefore, could benefit dramatically from consuming these small fruits.", "Nuts And Seeds", "Should those using a home care agency eat nuts and seeds to fight Alzheimer\u2019s? What about the fat content?", "Nuts and seeds may be high in fat, but the evidence suggests that, unlike animal products, they are beneficial to health and could help to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s.", "Nuts are different from fatty cuts of meat because the fat they contain is of a different sort and comes packaged up with a bunch of beneficial phytonutrients which appear to offset the effect. Almonds, for instance, seem to improve the health of the endothelium \u2013 the lining of the artery walls.", "Nuts and seeds, therefore, could be great food for helping people in-home care to boost their brain power and keep Alzheimer\u2019s at bay. Some nuts and seeds, like flax and walnuts, are high in omega-3, an anti-inflammatory essential fatty acid that the brain uses to form new cells. Eating more of these anti-inflammatory foods could improve overall brain health and reduce instances of neurodegenerative disease in the elderly.", "Broccoli And Kale", "Broccoli and kale are superstars of the nutrition world. They\u2019re both members of the brassica family of vegetables, sometimes referred to as cruciferous vegetables. Brassicas, like kale, collards, chard, beet greens, rocket, watercress, and cauliflower contain a unique combination of nutrients which sets them apart from other green veggies, like spinach.", "Perhaps the most crucial effect that they have on the body is their ability to upregulate detoxifying enzymes in the liver. When you chew on raw broccoli or kale, you release something called sulforaphane. Our livers use this chemical to detox the body of all sorts of things, including heavy metals. As you are probably already aware, heavy metals in things like fish and industrially-reared meats, can accumulate in the brain and cause issues, including Alzheimer\u2019s. Brassica vegetables may, therefore, reduce the incidence of these diseases by helping the liver clear toxins from the bloodstream.", "Overall Diet And Alzheimer\u2019s", "Even though specific foods can have a beneficial effect on people in home care with Alzheimer\u2019s, the most critical factor is the overall quality of the diet. It isn\u2019t so much about specific foods that prevent or treat the disease, but what people eat on a day-to-day basis.", "For instance, you could eat all of the foods in this list, but if a person only does so in small amounts, or the rest of their diet is made up of processed sausages and ice cream, then you\u2019re unlikely to see any beneficial effects.", "The reason the incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s was so much lower in the past in certain countries was that they didn\u2019t have access to many of the harmful foods now associated with the disease. They were only able to eat the food that the land provided, and usually, that was whole plant staples with meat on special occasions. On the Japanese island of Okinawa, for instance, 80 percent of calories came from sweet potatoes, with the rest made up of beans, greens, and some fruit.", "Reducing the effects of Alzheimer\u2019s involves committing to dietary change. But the transition doesn\u2019t have to be painful. Once you know what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s rather easy. Take breakfast, for instance. Instead of sugary cereal, choose whole grain muesli or oat porridge. For dinner, instead of shepherd\u2019s pie with lots of beef mince, swap it out for lentils, and serve it with a side of cruciferous veggies. Lunch is easy too: whole grain pittas and hummus (made with chickpeas), with veggie dippers.", "When it comes to fighting Alzheimer\u2019s, small changes can make a big difference. Cutting down on processed foods, animal products, and sugary junk and replacing it with high-nutrient-density alternatives could potentially fight the disease, prevent it from developing, and lead to improvements in the condition of people already suffering. With such a debilitating disease like Alzheimer\u2019s, it\u2019s worth making easy dietary changes. Most of the time, you can make one-for-one substitutions and never even notice you\u2019re eating much more healthily.", "We\u2019ve focused on the elderly in this article, but you can start fighting Alzheimer\u2019s at any age.

Just as with heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, what people eat makes a difference.", "While there is no evidence that nutritional interventions can reverse the progression of the disease, there are suggestions that it may be able to slow it down. Basing the diet around healthy foods could help fight changes in the brain that lead to cognitive decline.", "Music", "Music is an integral part of dementia care. Many people experiencing cognitive decline find that they can still enjoy the sound of music, even when the disease is highly advanced.

Their entire lives become focused on their role as a carer, and they self-attack every time they make a mistake.", "The truth, though, is that there is no such thing as a perfect carer.

Instead of explaining that what they believe is wrong and you\u2019re looking after them, many experienced carers have learned to go with the flow. Those with dementia cannot separate fact from fantasy, and so trying to ground them in reality is a lost cause.

In the early stages of the disease, you may need to implement strategies in the home to reduce fall risk and prepare meals. As the condition advances, you may need to provide around-the-clock bedside care. Eventually, dementia care will become a full-time job.

You may also have to take a career break and provide long-term care in the latter stages.", "Stick With The Drug Regimen", "While regular medicine cannot reverse the disease, it can make it more manageable for some patients and their families. Where possible, stick with the diagnosis and treatment regimen and move forward. Early in the progression of the disease, drug treatment can have a profound effect on how lucid your parent appears. Even towards the latter stages, there is evidence that it can improve cognition and quality of life.", "Prioritise Movement", "Evidence suggests that the more parents with dementia move, the better it is for their brains. Movement helps to stimulate the body to repair and protect its tissues, including the brain.

Watching someone you love, slowly lose their ability to remember things, to remember you, to talk, to walk and the fear of having to lose your independent relative to the thralls of a nursing home.  In the early stages of dementia, there is often only incredibly mild symptoms that relatives may pass off as absentmindedness; they may forget or lose their keys, they may leave milk out, or forget to turn their running water off. It can be stressful for families, they might find themselves worrying about leaving their relatives alone, overnight, and it may seem the only solution, as their symptoms progress further, to put them into care. Dementia can be a slow disease, it usually has around a five to six year prognosis once it is diagnosed in the early stages, but certain factors can mean these figures change. Dementia will manifest in people differently, there are many types of dementia and lots of lifestyle factors play a part in how much people are affected when living at home; if their physical capacity is diminished, if they lose the ability to communicate well or if they are living with any other diseases at the time. ", "But this doesn\u2019t mean that in these early changes, you need to force your relative into a nursing home. There are plenty of new technologies nowadays that are assisting people in living at home for longer, which halts the fear of hefty fees, choosing a nursing home and severing your relatives connection to their home; a place where they feel comfortable, happy and safe. Moving into a home can be a very damaging and stressful time for your relative; they\u2019ll feel confused, scared and be unsure as to why they are leaving home; but thanks to new technologies, this may not have to be the case as we move forward into the new decade. Technology is forever advancing, within medicine and within care, and millions upon millions of people worldwide suffer with some form of dementia or Alzheimers. Their homes must meet regulations to ensure that they are living without any hazards; open fires and gas can pose a threat, as well as homes that aren\u2019t well lit, tidiness of the home to prevent any mishaps such as falls or stumbling around the home. If they are still of age to be driving, it may be worth flagging this up with a nurse or your care assistant to see if they are still capable of using their car; any immediate dangers must be eliminated as well as tests to see if their physical health is up to par. If they need aids around the house such as stairlifts, wheelchairs, medicines or new beds so that they are living safely but still in comfort. Many things can be done to assist care at home for dementia patients; but of course it all begins with noticing the signs and having a clear diagnosis and prognosis.", "Diagnosis is the very beginning of the journey; any mild symptoms should be checked out as soon as possible. You don\u2019t want your relative to feel scared of any new symptoms arising; but denial too, may play a role in this; many relatives do not want to have to admit that their relative has dementia, it is scary and the beginning of a new journey.  Diagnosis can often be done at the hospital, and rule out any other issues such as stroke \u2013 however, some types of dementia are caused by a continuation of mini strokes that may not be detected, so staying vigilant with your relatives behaviour is going to be important for the start of the journey.  If your relative has already been diagnosed with dementia, the important part of care is monitoring changes and deterioration. It is an inevitable part of the disease but for the patient in question, they are often blissfully unaware that anything is wrong with them, even as they return to their childhood state and unable to speak coherently, they will still believe that they are living as normal and will often live in some kind of fantasy world that is heightened by hallucinations; another symptom to look out for.", "So what are these new advances and how can they shape the future of how we care for dementia patients? They are truly innovative and can bring a clearer brighter future for those who are suffering with the disease; dementia care is so important now that we know much more about it. Nursing homes can be costly, it may even mean your relative having to sell all their assets in order to pay for their care; and nursing homes are incredibly overcrowded, there may even be waiting lists, so keeping them at home for longer may well be the best option for all. There is a mass of research being put into dementia, how it affects the body, how it starts and possible cures, but the main thing today, until that solution is found, is to keep the patients feeling secure.  ", "New technologies can ultimately transform the way we deal with dementia, the way patients deal with dementia and families alike, it can be a beacon of hope for those in the future that are wanting their relatives to stay at home for longer. Any poor care in dementia will lead to deaths and patients being admitted to hospitals which only overcrowds wards and puts pressure on medical systems and patients too, which can all be avoided with new simple technologies. Of course, they need to be well financed, it takes financial assistance, patience and attention to detail to bring these ideas to fruition but they are well on the way to being a viable option in the coming months and years. ", "All this technology above may sound beyond wonderful to those who live with dementia but the one element that must not be forgotten and won\u2019t be forgotten is the human element. People with dementia are still people. They still need care, human touch, a conversation, even if they don\u2019t understand that conversation, they like to talk, to express themselves and it\u2019s important that they don\u2019t begin to suffer with loneliness. If they have no family, they may not have someone to come sit with them for a cup of tea for an hour. The improvement with technology can only be a good thing and intervene at early stages, and prevent further problems to help everyone on all levels. Human contact will always be a huge bonus, but often this can take time and money but the core of the problem, on a medical level can be controlled well. Ensuring dementia patients aren\u2019t alone and aren\u2019t feeling isolated from the world can be well managed by other means, but technologies are mostly to be used for the practical side of dementia, keeping patients safe, monitoring their changes, keeping them safe at home and allowing them to live the life they are used to for longer, if they should want it.  ", "Raising more money for the implementation of these technologies will be vital and there are many charities, often in your local city/area which will always be open to donations for dementia support and more and more cities and countries are becoming \u2018dementia friendly\u2019 to help those who live independently and to know people in the area who may suffer with the disease and to ensure they are being looked after. Dementia care in Australia has some pioneering ideas and are leading the way in the future of dementia home care. It is believed that keeping dementia patients at home for longer, may halt the progression of the disease slightly, due to the patients remaining active and still being able to be physical, such as cooking for themselves, if possible, going out to the shop, all this is taken from them if they are put into a nursing home. Their last remaining shreds of independence can be kept in tact until their disease becomes too progressed and they are incapable of living alone, but more often than not, patients are put into nursing homes before they need to be, which is a huge shock to their system. Therefore, we should focus solely on the benefits and positives of keeping dementia patients at home for longer, it\u2019s possible and it\u2019s necessary.

Following decades of research, it\u2019s been shown that music and art can be extremely beneficial for patients with dementia. Whether individuals are newly diagnosed and experiencing minimal symptoms or have been symptomatic for quite some time, engaging in artistic pursuits and craftwork can improve memory and enhance communication skills.\u00a0", "How do art and music help?\u00a0", "Although there isn\u2019t a cure for dementia yet, scientists have made breakthroughs when it comes to the management of various forms of dementia. In patients suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, for example, doctors are now able to understand exactly how the condition progresses and why. In addition to understanding how dementia progresses, research has highlighted ways in which symptoms can be minimised and managed.\u00a0", "Arts, crafts and music are just one of the ways to help reduce the symptoms of dementia, and they can be a valuable element of dementia care and elderly care. With a range of activities, which can be modified according to the individual\u2019s needs, people can engage in music and artwork at any time.", "Enhancing memory", "Simply listening to a song or tune can immediately take you back to a certain time or place, and this is exactly the same for individuals with dementia. Whilst the disease may limit their ability to recall people, names, places or events, music can help to restore these memories, even if it is only on a temporary basis.", "Listening to music can provoke memories which have previously eluded the individual and may take them back to a time in their life they were previously unable to recall. For many individuals, music provides a link to their past which is otherwise severed, and this can be a cause for celebration.\u00a0", "Enabling individuals to recall major life events is worthwhile in itself, but it can also provide a sense of comfort and increased confidence. If patients are aware that their memory is failing, they can find it very frustrating, scary and isolating. By using music to help them recall details of their lives, nurses and carers can help to reduce the symptoms of dementia and enable individuals to cherish their memories.\u00a0", "Improving communication", "Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia can limit a person\u2019s ability to communicate. In many instances, people may find it increasingly difficult to express themselves as the disease progresses. When this happens, people may become frustrated and withdrawn, as they are unable to convey their feelings, thoughts or emotions.\u00a0", "With the opportunity to try free-form art, however, individuals have the change to express themselves in a whole new way. Whether they have previously had an interest in art or not, being able to communicate with others and express their own emotions via drawing or painting can be freeing and therapeutic.\u00a0", "Music has also enhanced communication and expression in people with various forms of dementia and has been successfully trialled by many doctors, nurses and patients. Individuals who previously avoided engaging with people often become far more animated and willing to engage with others when music is being played. Furthermore, studies have shown that individuals with dementia are more likely to engage with each other and those around them when music is played, often in the form of sharing memories and anecdotes.", "Minimising anxiety", "A dementia diagnosis can be anxiety-inducing for the patient, as well as for their friends and family. Whilst dementia invariably reduces a person\u2019s level of independence, it can also heighten their sense of anxiety. In fact, it\u2019s this anxiety and distress which can be extremely upsetting for the individual and those around them. Fortunately, therapeutic activities, such as artwork, have been shown to reduce anxiety by a significant amount.\u00a0", "The act of drawing and painting in itself can be calming, and becoming engrossed in an activity helps to keep the mind focused. As a result, individuals with dementia tend to experience far less anxiety when they are stimulated with music and/or art. In addition to providing short-term anxiety-relief, many individuals express less anxiety in general when they incorporate these activities into their day-to-day lives.", "Furthermore, listening to music can be soothing and anxiety-reducing in itself. Whether it\u2019s listening to a tune which reminds you of your childhood, a song that was played at your wedding or enjoying relaxing melodies, simply having music on can help to minimise feelings of anxiety and depression.", "Reducing depression", "Individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other types of dementia can often experience feelings of depression, particularly if they feel isolated or unable to take part in the things they used to enjoy. Whilst it\u2019s not uncommon for individuals with dementia to also experience depression, there are steps which can reduce these unpleasant emotions and improve their quality of life. Listening to music can be extremely beneficial for people with depression, regardless of their age or medical condition. By provoking positive emotions, music can have a beneficial short and long-term effect on anyone who is battling depression or depressive thoughts.", "Alleviating boredom", "Many people with dementia experience boredom and this can be a precursor to isolation, loneliness and depression. If their condition prevents them from expressing themselves or engaging with other people, they may struggle to find things to do. Similarly, if their mobility is affected by dementia or another, unrelated condition, they may feel unable to take part in things they used to enjoy.\u00a0", "Music and art-based activities can be an extremely effective way of alleviating boredom, and they can be modified to suit the individual\u2019s particular level of ability and their interests. By giving them the freedom to chose how to engage in artwork or music sessions, individuals can control how they approach these activities. Furthermore, these activities can be shared with other people, which can lead to a reduction in boredom. Delivering the perfect balance for individuals with varying abilities, artwork and music is something which can be used to alleviate boredom and frustration throughout every stage of their dementia diagnosis.", "Maintaining sociability", "Individuals with dementia can gradually become more isolated, and even spending time with family and friends may be difficult. If a loved one struggles to play cards or engage in a board game, for example, listening to music or trying some artwork can be a great alternative. Listening to a song or album requires little cognitive input when compared to other activities, so it\u2019s something which can be enjoyed by everyone. If a loved one is reluctant to play a game or engage in conversation, simply enjoying some music with them can be a perfect alternative.\u00a0", "Similarly, doing artwork together can be a relaxing and enjoyable pastime for all involved. With no need to try and memorise the rules to a card game or whose turn it is to play next, artwork is something which doesn\u2019t tend to provoke feelings of anxiety or stress, and this is obviously advantageous for individuals with dementia.", "In addition to this, music and art are activities which are easy to undertake anywhere. A home care package can easily incorporate music and artwork, and individuals can also engage in these activities outdoors or when they\u2019re out and about. If individuals tend to become anxious whilst waiting to attend a medical appointment, for example, it\u2019s easy to pack a small sketchbook and some pencils so that they can take their mind off of their appointment while they wait.", "Suitable for all abilities", "One of the major benefits of both artwork and music is that there are activities which anyone can enjoy and take part in. Suitable for people of all abilities, these activities can be beneficial during the early stages of dementia, as well as when the condition is more advanced. Some individuals may enjoy sculpting pieces from clay or engaging in craft work like macram\u00e9, for example, whilst others may prefer to draw using pencils. Similarly, when listening to music, some individuals may like to take an active role in selecting songs to listen to, others may enjoy singing along and others may simply tap their foot or nod their head in time to the music.\u00a0", "With no pressure to take part in a certain way or to perform the activity in a set methodology, individuals can be encouraged to take part in exactly the way they choose. Indeed, giving individuals with dementia a choice regarding how they do things can be empowering itself. Aside from the benefits associated with art and music, activities which give individuals choice and autonomy also provide them with a sense of control. As dementia tends to rob people of their control and independence, the freedom associated with music and artwork can be highly therapeutic.\u00a0", "Professional Art and Music Therapy", "Delivered by certified professionals, art and music therapy can be effective in numerous situations. In addition to assisting people with dementia, art and music therapies have been shown to help people of all ages when they\u2019re suffering from physical and/or mental illnesses.\u00a0", "Of course, professional music and art therapy can be effective in enhancing communication and memory, as well as reducing anxiety, for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia. If there are local certified art therapy classes or music therapy sessions, for example, your elderly care package may include assistance in attending these groups.\u00a0", "However, you don\u2019t have to rely on professional or certified art and music therapy to benefit from these activities. Whilst professional art and music therapists spend years studying how these activities can help people, you needn\u2019t miss out on the benefit they bring if there isn\u2019t a class locally or if professional art and music therapy is outside of your budget.", "Simply engaging in these activities on an informal basis can be beneficial to people with dementia, particularly if it\u2019s something they can enjoy with other people. Although there is certainly a place for professional music and art therapy within dementia care, this isn\u2019t the only way to ensure people with dementia benefit from artwork and music.", "Individual art and music choices", "Like all forms of dementia care and senior care, activities should be as unique as possible. By tailoring artwork and music to the individual\u2019s particular interests, you can enhance its impact even further. If an individual used to play the cello, for example, they may enjoy listening to compositions which include the cello or classical and orchestral music. Alternatively, if an individual was a champion rock and roll dancer, they may prefer to listen to rock and roll hits from the 1950s and 1960s.\u00a0", "If individuals are able to select their own music playlist, this can be an immersive and enjoyable activity, particularly as it gives them control over what they listen to. However, if individuals with dementia are unable to convey their preferred choice of music, family and friends may be able to assist. By identifying artists and songs the patient used to enjoy, nurses and carers can ensure the same music is available for them to enjoy. Alternatively, trying out different genres and music from various eras can be a great way to discover new tunes and determine which the individual enjoys the most.\u00a0", "When listening to music, some individuals may enjoy controlling the music player themselves and selecting which track to play. With a fully-loaded MP3 player and some headphones, for example, patients can simply skip to the track they want to listen to, thus giving them increased control and freedom. For many patients, the loss of independence and control is a major factor in their experience of dementia, so any activities which restore their freedom and choice are extremely worthwhile.", "Similarly, art-based activities can be tailored to an individual\u2019s specific interests and abilities, so there\u2019s no need to rely on a one-size-fits-all approach.

Furthermore, art and music activities can be undertaken anywhere, so they\u2019re ideal for individuals who wish to receive home care services or respite care.\u00a0", "With dedicated nurses and carers on hand, domiciliary care and elderly care at home can be tailored around their needs. Indeed, senior care enables nurses are carers to focus their attention on the individual more in a home setting, and individuals can benefit from their undivided attention and interaction.

As a result, you should always contact a doctor or seek medical advice before starting any exercise so that you can get some solid advice on what types of exercise to perform, for how long and when you should stop. If you or a loved one with dementia is feeling unwell, breathless or sick after exercise, then you should stop immediately and speak with a doctor as soon as possible.", "Physical activity may also be difficult if you\u2019re already experiencing pains or difficulties with mobility.

This means that oxygen is carried around the body more easily, providing you with more oxygen and a reduced risk of high blood pressure and heart diseases. As you slowly exercise and gradually exert more physical force, you\u2019ll start to build a healthier heart that can be pushed more and more for even further benefits.", "You also reduce the risk of certain cancers such as breast and colon cancer. Exercise can also help protect you against the possibility of stroke and also type 2 diabetes. Osteoporosis (a bone-affecting disease that makes them brittle and weak) can also be avoided with regular physical activity.", "Physical exercise will primarily help you build more strength and also maintain your muscles. Your flexibility will also be improved which means that your joints will work better. This gives you a bit more manoeuvrability which means you can perform tasks more efficiently and independently. From getting dressed yourself to lifting yourself out of the bath, these tasks are easier to perform with a stronger and more flexible body. More independence is never a bad thing especially if you want to regain more control over your life and not become too dependent on those around you.", "Exercise will also help you work up an appetite in order to fuel your physical activity. This means that you\u2019ll likely stick to a better meal plan with improved nutrition and eat more regular meals to keep your body healthy.

If you\u2019re having trouble getting to sleep at night, then expending more energy throughout the day can also help your body rest easily at night.", "In addition to the physical benefits, we also have to talk about the mental benefits of exercise. One of the most life-changing benefits to expect from regular exercise is improved cognitive abilities. As many dementia-related symptoms stem from mental issues, improving your cognition can help to slow down your mental decline and also improve your memory. This means that you\u2019ll be less forgetful and your mind will be more active, resulting in a healthier mental state that will improve your mood, self-esteem and confidence.", "Lastly, we can also talk about the secondary benefits that aren\u2019t necessarily linked directly to exercise. For instance, attending group meetings for exercise means that you\u2019ll have more opportunities to meet people and talk with them. This helps to avoid feelings of isolation and regular interactions can help improve your confidence, self-esteem and even your mood. This can eventually lead to making more friends, having more reliable individuals to trust for safety purposes and also improves your social skills.", "As you can see, physical activity has many primary benefits as well as secondary benefits that happen indirectly.

Physical conditions like bone and joint problems or balance issues may also get in the way of the physical activities that you plan to participate in. While these conditions shouldn\u2019t stop you from completely doing any physical activities, they are important considerations and you absolutely need to speak to a professional before you end up overworking your body.", "One way of ensuring that you\u2019re in safe hands when exercising is to join a group. If you speak to your doctor then you\u2019ll likely get recommendations on where to look for a local fitness group that is designed for those with dementia or challenging physical conditions that need more attention and care. You ideally don\u2019t want to work with a personal trainer unless they\u2019ve worked with people that have your conditions in the past.

Thankfully, there are also many lighter exercise options that don\u2019t require you to attend group sessions and can be performed whenever you want.", "A great example of this would be gardening. Gardening is a physical activity that can be performed in your own home and, in most cases, you won\u2019t even realise that it\u2019s a physical activity because you\u2019ve got something else to focus on. You won\u2019t just be looking at how many calories you\u2019re burning or how much you\u2019re sweating, but instead, you\u2019ll focus on getting your garden sorted out, cleaned and growing beautifully. Gardening also has the advantage that it\u2019s a great hobby that can help strengthen your mind and your body, while also improving your heart in a fun way.", "For something more exotic, tai chi is a gentle Chinese martial art that mixes simple movements and breathing exercises to create a relaxing exercise experience. You shouldn\u2019t expect to sweat it out and build muscles with tai chi, but instead, it focuses more on improving your mental health while also giving you a light workout. The western opposite to this would be yoga, a form of exercise that focuses a bit more on flexibility and weight loss than mindfulness and mental health. Ideally, you\u2019ll want to mix the two of these to create a unique workout that will help increase your agility, flexibility, strength and mental health.", "Lastly, there\u2019s also the most basic form of physical activity we can think of; walking. Walking is often suitable for everyone, it can be a group activity, it\u2019s free and doesn\u2019t need a specialist to guide you, and there\u2019s plenty of walking equipment choices that can help you should you have limited mobility. Group walks are a great way to enjoy a bit of light physical activity with your family or your dementia home carer, and it can be incorporated into anyone\u2019s day. For instance, you could tell yourself that you\u2019ll walk to the store a couple more times a day to pick up groceries, or you could walk around for longer with your dog. Walking can be combined with social activities and easily incorporated into your everyday commitments, making it one of the best choices for light physical activity.", "Some final words", "As you can see, exercise comes with many benefits for people with dementia, and it\u2019s also very simple to take advantage as long as you\u2019re careful about your limitations and physical abilities.

Each of them could carry a different issue and, in some cases, may be a cause for concern.", "For example, if mail is stacking up and being left alone, then it\u2019s important to help them read through the letters and deal with any concerns that they may have. For instance, if it\u2019s an unpaid bill then they could start to receive threatening phone calls from utility services that will hurt their mental state and could cause a lot of undue stress. This is where having a home carer is important because they\u2019ll be able to sort out any outstanding issues for your loved one. However, there are also times when their financial situation could be caused by poor habits, potentially such as gambling, and it\u2019s a good idea to help keep the issue under control.", "Another potential thing to look out for is the food and supplies in their home. If you find that their pantry is empty and that the fridge is lacking, then it could be because your loved one is unable to go outside or has difficulty doing so. It may be due to social isolation which has caused them to be afraid of going outside, or it could be their mobility issues that are preventing them from heading out on their own. It could also be a heavy reliance on fast food and take outs due to stress or depression, and these are all important concerns that should be dealt with as soon as possible. Again, a home carer can help in this case by either helping your loved one do the shopping or even take them outside to walk the markets and stores for food.", "In short, general home care and maintenance should be a big sign if your loved ones need home care support or not.

However, as our senior loved ones grew up in much earlier generations, they likely don\u2019t have the same amount of exposure to technology and, as a result, can\u2019t take advantage of all the advances like smartphones, computers and tablets to stay in touch. This means that they could end up socially isolating themselves because they don\u2019t have anyone to communicate with or they rarely get to speak to others. In fact, many elderly seniors consider TV and radio to be their main form of companionship.", "This is where encouraging your loved ones to use technology can be helpful to ensure they stay connected with friends and family members, but it can still be challenging if you\u2019re tasked with overseeing the learning process. This is where a home care expert can help not only teach your loved ones to use technology, but also provide social comfort so that they don\u2019t feel isolated. Learning to use technology can be a huge benefit even if it can be quite difficult to grasp, but having a trained professional carer at their side will make it that much easier for your loved ones to stay in touch with the rest of the world.", "A carer can also help to introduce your loved ones to the outside world.

For instance, if you feel that your loved ones have gained or lost an excessive amount of weight in a short time, then it could be because they\u2019re eating or cooking too much, that they\u2019re not eating enough or that they\u2019re falling into poor eating habits. If you feel that their weight has changed drastically and not for a good reason, then it\u2019s best to ask them about their eating habits to see how you can help. This is much easier to handle with a carer at their side who can monitor what they\u2019re eating, ensure that they\u2019re getting all the nutrients they need and also help prevent them from falling into poor eating habits.", "Other appearance clues can include how their hair looks, the clothes they\u2019re wearing and also their general facial expression. Things like their clothing and physical appearance can usually come down to if they\u2019re maintaining their hygiene care or if they\u2019re able to wash their clothes comfortably without stressing their bodies. This is also where a carer can come in handy. Having someone who is able to help your loved one improve their appearance by doing their hair, helping to trim it if needed and also helping to pick out their clothes can greatly improve their appearance.

It can help improve their self-esteem, their confidence and also make them more likely to head outside and take part in social situations.

It could be that they\u2019re falling more often and potentially even being taken to hospital due to a fall, it could be that they\u2019ve moved to a downstairs bedroom because they\u2019re unable to climb the stairs on a regular basis, or it could be that they\u2019re travelling to visit you less because they\u2019re unable to walk as far without getting tired.", "These are very common issues to develop over time, but there are many solutions to help remedy this. One is to ensure that there are supports installed around the home such as handles around areas like the toilet and wherever steps are involved. A rather expensive solution for traversing stairs would be to rely on a lift, but this needs to be installed professionally. For areas such as the bathroom, it\u2019s important to consider switching current bathtubs and showers for more mobility-friendly options, such as a sit-down bath or a seating area in the shower. Lastly, for outdoor mobility, investing in a mobility solution can be a great way to encourage your loved ones to go outside more.", "While these solutions are a great way to solve mobility problems, another all-in-one solution is to actually hire a home carer. This is because a home carer can solve many of the issues related to mobility, such as helping your loved ones around the home, helping them outside to meet with friends and family members, or even assisting them with mobility-related tasks such as cleaning, gardening and shopping. Most importantly, having another person around the home helps them ensure that your loved ones do not injure themselves should they fall over, slip in the bathroom or trip on something in their house.", "In short, it\u2019s having a home carer take care of your loved ones will provide plenty of security and safety when it comes to mobility. They\u2019ll help ensure that mobility solutions for your loved ones are effective, and they\u2019ll also relieve them of much of the stress that comes with coping with less mobility as they age.", "Accidents and reports can be very sudden, but if your loved ones are involved then it\u2019s usually a wake-up call that something needs to be done in order to take better care of them. For example, if you\u2019ve recently received a phone call that a loved one is in the hospital because they slipped at home or because they were in a car crash, then it can be difficult to trust them being on their own. Perhaps it\u2019s the slowly declining motor skills or perhaps even slower reflexes that make it difficult for them to drive a vehicle. Whatever the case may be, any accidents and reports involving your senior loved ones should be taken very seriously.", "However, you can\u2019t always be expected to be there for them especially if you have your own family and career to worry about. While frequent visits are perfectly fine, you should consider hiring a home carer to look after them. If you get to know the carer, learn about their personality and slowly build up trust, then they\u2019ll effectively be an honorary member of the family that will get to know your loved one and look after them. This will drastically reduce the possibility of a negative report such as a car accident or a fall at home, and it will give you peace of mind knowing that someone will always be looking out for your loved one.", "Hopefully, this article has given you some good advice on when you should consider hiring a home carer for your loved ones to ensure their safety and wellbeing.", " Copyright \u00a9 2019 Dementia Caring", " ", "Website Development Services", "  By ", "Vickey Parchani", "Dementia comes in many different forms and can affect a wide range of different people. This is why dementia care is an important component of general healthcare that can ensure that those affected by dementia-related diseases can get the help they need in order to live healthy lives despite the symptoms.", "Thankfully, technology is starting to improve the lives of those who live with dementia at home. While home care services have traditionally been the go-to method to take care of those who are affected by dementia-related diseases, technological advances are now starting to make their way into our homes. They can offer dementia patients some relief and even assistance to make everyday life easier to cope with.", "In this article, we\u2019re going to talk about the many different ways that technology can and already has helped many people cope with their symptoms. We\u2019ll also talk about a couple of growing technologies that will likely have a huge impact on how we cope with dementia in the future.", "Why is technology so important for helping people with dementia?", "For a long time, technology has provided us with many ways to live our lives in comfort. Whether it\u2019s easing the stress of memorising something important like phone numbers or giving us the ability to purchase heavy goods online and have them conveniently delivered, technology has the ability to empower our lives. Technology has already greatly advanced the medical field and it\u2019s only just getting started with dementia.", "For those that live with dementia, home care is often the most common choice when it comes to coping with the symptoms. However, home care doesn\u2019t offer independent living on the level that most people would prefer. While technology can\u2019t yet provide a dementia patient with full independence, it\u2019s slowly getting there and can certainly help provide practical solutions to home carers and family members.", "Dementia-focused technology aims to provide people with ways to maintain their preferred lifestyle despite any symptoms of dementia that they\u2019re facing. Assistive and enabling technologies can cover anything from a physical device to an online service that is accessed through the web. They\u2019re often everyday items such as small devices with built-in technologies such as sensors and cameras that are designed to monitor patients while also providing them with assistance when possible.", "Technology to help dementia patients stay connected", "We\u2019re already making great use of technology to help dementia patients stay connected to friends and family members. A common example that most people use is smartphones. Smartphone technology provides everyone with a way to stay in touch either through the use of text messaging, online communication or traditional voice calls. However, technology has advanced enough that smartphones are essentially small computers that can be fitted with sensors and voice-activated software to help someone coping with dementia to live a more comfortable life.", "There are also many phones that stray away from the typical smartphone touchscreen design. These phones are designed to be used much like traditional phones and sport large tactile buttons and a clear display that makes it very easy to operate. While these can lack the features of a smartphone, they\u2019re often still a great way to help a dementia patient stay in touch with loved ones through voice.", "To take a step up, tablet devices are starting to become easier to use thanks to software advances and upgrades. They can be used easily as digital picture frames, video chat devices and even be used to browse the internet on a larger display instead of relying on a smartphone with a comparatively smaller screen. While tablet devices do have a lot of functionality, learning to use them is something that home care services can help their patients with.", "In short, technology has given dementia patients many ways to stay in touch with not just their loved ones and close friends, but also stay in touch with communities through online social media platforms and message boards. This way they can keep up with their hobbies, watch relevant news on a convenient device and also install helpful apps that could help to monitor things such as their diet, budget and even lifestyle.", "Technology provides dementia patients with more safety and security", "Dementia carers and family members often find that they\u2019re worried about the safety and security of those who have to cope with dementia. This is why many people find that it\u2019s necessary to always have watchful eyes close to their loved ones that are struggling with dementia, but this can be taxing on others and rather time-consuming. Thankfully, technology has introduced many ways for us to take better care of our loved ones that are coping with dementia.", "For instance, there are many sensors built into devices that can alert is when someone has a fall. These devices can automatically ring emergency personnel and family members when it triggers, and there are also GPS trackers that can be used to keep track of someone\u2019s location. This means that if someone experiences a bout of dementia and decides to wander outside or down the street, the device can automatically pick this up and alert the relevant people. However, it\u2019s not just about keeping track of your loved ones.", "It\u2019s also equally important to protect them from the home that they live in. Whether it\u2019s certain appliances that aren\u2019t completely safe to use or detectors that should be updated and maintained on a regular basis for more safety, it\u2019s vital to look at the technologies that can help dementia patients live a more comfortable life and also give peace of mind to family members and carers. A good example of this is adding smoke detectors that will also alert family members and carers when they go off or ensuring that the bath doesn\u2019t overflow by installing preventative measures and sensors. There are also devices that can automatically switch off to save energy and also ensure that no appliances are left on for long periods of time. These can even turn off gas-powered appliances such as a cooking range to ensure that the home and your loved one are both kept safe.", "With so many great forms of technology helping to keep our loved ones safe, it\u2019s easy to see just how important these advancements are. Although many of them will require installing new devices and teaching your loved ones how to use certain devices, they\u2019re designed to be simple to use and will help ensure that your loved ones are kept safe at all times.", "Technology helps dementia patients stick to routines and remember important notes", "Dementia is often characterised by a difficult of remembering things. Whether it\u2019s small bits of information such as phone numbers or meeting dates, it\u2019s a challenging prospect for those coping with dementia to stick to routines and remember important information. This is where ", "dementia care services can help", "; with someone else there to help remember important bits of information and routines, it makes coping with dementia a little easier.", "However, technology can also help patients with dementia to remember important information and routines. Whether it\u2019s taking medication at certain times of the day or even alarms to alert them of the different times of day, it can help to minimise stress and also encourage them to keep better track of meal times.", "A simple example of this type of technology could be a special clock that can be downloaded onto smartphones or come as separate portable devices. These clocks could have alarm functionality which will ensure that the person coping with dementia remembers important dates and times throughout the day, and it can also show the date, week and month if necessary. These separate devices and smartphone apps are a great way to remind dementia patients of important things, but this type of functionality can also be added to everyday devices. For instance, a pill dispenser could actually be programmed to open at a specific time and alert the user that they should be taking medication. These are automatic once programmed correctly and will help ensure that people coping with dementia never forget to take their medication.", "Clocks themselves can also be relatively customisable and advanced thanks to technology. Clocks can help to ensure a dementia patient sleeps well at night and helps them maintain a regular sleep schedule. These can simply be modified or set by a home carer or a relative and then activate automatically with a few simple controls should your loved one need to turn off the alarm or disable it temporarily.", "To conclude, technology is a great way to make reminders and help dementia patients stick to routines. Due to the characteristic symptom of having a poor memory, dementia can make it difficult to follow an important routine and could even contribute to skipped medication or even dangerous side effects of medicine due to taking them too often.", "Future technologies can help to predict changes as they happen", "Thanks to the variety of sensors available on devices and also advances in artificial intelligence and learning algorithms, we may be able to start predicting changes and improvements in one\u2019s dementia case. Sensors can be placed around the home or even on the body of the dementia patient to detect everything from their general health quality to their stride and physical body strength. This data can then be fed to an artificial intelligence that will help to determine if there are any changes to your loved one\u2019s health. If it picks up something gradual such as a change in how they walk or their reaction time to certain things, then the data can be used to predict when changes will happen so that preparations can be made in advance.", "Sensors can also monitor vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and temperature without having to be physically with the dementia patient and examining them. These sensors can then be set up to play alarms or alerts when something has gone wrong or when further assistance is needed in an emergency situation. These sensors will typically come in the form of a wristband, a smartphone or even cameras and built-in sensors in the home. By tracking all of this data, it can help to detect any issues before they develop into concerning problems.", "These devices and technologies have the advantage that they typically don\u2019t interfere with one\u2019s life. Since the devices are small or don\u2019t need to be \u201cused\u201d in order to collect that data, it won\u2019t bother your loved ones and they can live their lives normally. Much of this information can also be submitted to medical professionals (if you choose to) so that they can compile it and use it in further research to develop better medical services and technologies for dementia patients.", "Future AI-powered technologies may also even pave the way to voice-controlled robots that can interact with people living with dementia and also alert them of important things. This could include alerting them about taking medication, about the temperature of their body or even who\u2019s knocking at the front door. These voice-controlled robots could play a very important role in how assistive technologies grow and could even become an effective assistant to use in conjunction with dementia home care specialists.", "Some final words", "Technology is constantly growing and thanks to all the data that has been collected and the advancements that are being made, it\u2019s easy to see just how much of an impact technology can make on someone\u2019s life to help them cope with dementia. Regardless of how severe the conditions are, there will likely always be some kind of technologies that can assist those with dementia.", "Whether it\u2019s for safety and security, to help establish or maintain a routine, or even to help stay in touch with loved ones, technology has helped many that have to cope with dementia to live more comfortable lives. While it\u2019s likely not going to completely replace professional dementia home care, it will certainly assist in their lives and make certain tasks easier.", " Copyright \u00a9 2019 Dementia
