Pfitzner has saved an average of $2,115.86 each year on household electricity bills, and has managed to power his home for just 46 cents per day, all while using air-conditioning, electricity and appliances as normal.", "\u201cFor many families, these results sit firmly in the \u2018too good to be true\u2019 realm,\u201d says Chris Williams, CEO & Founder of Natural Solar. \u201cNick was one of the first people in the world to have his Tesla Powerwall installed, and effectively started what we term the \u2018battery boom\u2019 globally. To see the numbers stack up after four years proves the technology is truly here to stay and will likely only continue to grow with a huge demand worldwide.\u201d", "Before installing their first generation Tesla Powerwall and 5kWp solar system, the Pfitzner family were previously paying an average of $572.29 per quarter to power their four bedroom home with an internal laundry, air-conditioning, state of the art appliances, a pool and outdoor entertaining area. For the past four years, the Pfitzner household has seen a drop in their average quarterly price of power by 92% to just $45.16 per quarter. Some quarterly bills have seen the Pfitzner family pay just $19.47 to power their entire home for the entire three month period.", "\u201cWhen you crunch the numbers, it\u2019s astonishing to see the real time, real life savings. For the full four years, the Pfitzner household has only paid $677.34 to power their entire home \u2013 their quarterly electricity bills used to be just $105 less than this. When the price of power is increasing by an average of 10%-15% per annum, these unprecedented savings really speak to the benefits of battery power. At Natural Solar, we are seeing most of our customers that install solar and battery storage in their homes experience a reduction in their power bills by up to 90% and like Nick, have an ROI period of just 7 years,\u201d says Mr Williams.", "Since this initial high profile battery installation in January 2016, Natural Solar has seen the demand for battery storage truly skyrocket. Natural Solar has received more than 425,000 consumer enquiries for battery power, and has installed thousands of battery storage systems in houses around the country. These results are relevant on a global scale with a 15,000 percent worldwide increase in home battery installations in the past four years.", "\u201cThe Tesla Powerwall has truly unleashed savings that many sceptics never before thought possible.

Ironically, given that electric cars might eventually displace petrol vehicles, Exxon abandoned its promising battery research program when oil prices fell in the early 1980s.", "Whittingham realised that lithium is a useful battery material because its atoms readily release their electrons, which can then provide a flow of charge.", "The next advancement was made by Goodenough, who figured out that changing one of the components of Whittingham\u2019s battery, from titanium disulfide to cobalt oxide, resulted in a much more powerful battery. He later found that iron phosphate was a less expensive and less toxic alternative that also worked well.", "The final step that led to the modern commercial battery was taken by Yoshino, who replaced the solid lithium metal in previous batteries with lithium ions embedded in a form of carbon called petroleum coke. This removed the danger posed by highly flammable lithium metal, which burns when exposed to air.", "Crucially, this also meant the battery\u2019s electrodes were not degraded by chemical reactions.

Enquiries from Natural Solar customers (", "www.naturalsolar.com.au", ") has increased in New South Wales by 187% in the past 12 months.", "\u201cThe largest market for battery power as it stands is New South Wales, with Sydney residents by far the biggest and earliest adopters of battery power nationally, accounting for 53% of households with battery storage systems in the country and 42% of customer enquiries for Natural Solar ,\u201d said Mr Williams. \u201cThe proven savings and benefits of battery power, both residentially and commercially, have seen energy storage solutions take priority when it comes to household investments,\u201d says Mr Williams.", "Like the first version of Tesla Powerwall, Tesla Powerwall 2 will allow consumers to store solar energy during sunlight hours, allowing homeowners to use it at night and avoiding the need to sell excess energy to the grid. The functionality of Tesla Powerwall 2 has improved considerably, offering double the storage capacity (from 7kWh to 14kWh).", "One of the first Tesla Powerwall 2 installations in New South Wales will occur for Steve Palazzolo of Ryde, North-West Sydney. His installation including a Tesla Powerwall 2 battery will be used to power his home where he lives with his wife and four children, as well as his home office from where he runs his IT Consultancy business. For Mr Palazzolo, the benefits of a solar and battery home storage solution are two-fold. Not only will he achieve savings and a huge reduction in his quarterly power bills averaging $1,100, Mr Palazzolo will also have further independence from the grid allowing his business will be able to run uninterrupted no matter the state of the network.", "\u201cThe commercial battery market is rapidly increasing, with over an 800% increase in commercial enquiries this financial year. The ability to continue to function during ever increasing grid outages is highly sought after by small to medium businesses as the impact on their business due to outages is at an immeasurable financial and reputational cost,\u201d says Mr Williams.", "Also set to receive his Tesla Powerwall 2 in the coming days is Jake Wallace of North Willoughby. Mr Wallace\u2019s residential installation includes solar panels and a Tesla Powerwall 2 home battery to match his Tesla car. Mr Wallace\u2019s motivation to move from purely a solar solution to the integration of battery power is driven by the savings associated with installing the Tesla Powerwall 2 and the anticipated 6-7 year return on investment for his own renewable energy storage solution. A family of three, the Wallace household uses enough energy on a quarterly basis for a household of six, with appliances and home features (including a pool) increasing his electricity usage.", "\u201cIt\u2019s been 18 months since we saw the initial Australian battery boom, and since then there has been a huge national and political discussion on battery power and the impact this has on the Australian population and consumers. Mass adoption of residential and commercial batteries is already underway and considered to be the new \u2018norm\u2019. Rarely do our customers at Natural Solar enquire for just solar anymore, and this is truly evident in New South Wales in Sydney and beyond. Smart batteries, grid integration and community grids are the next step in Australia for renewables,\u201d says Mr Williams.", "\u201cIt is clear the market has transitioned from an early adopter market to an early majority market, where substantial and proven savings results and a strong ROI can justify the purchase of these solutions.

half years, with projected savings in today\u2019s AUS dollars of over $68,500 over the expected 20-year lifespan of the investment.", "To better understand how the pieces of this deal came together,

solar, batteries or the grid.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe main element customers gravitated to was peace of mind,\u201d Williams says.", "Natural Solar\u2019s focus is the new home market, where it is a fairly straightforward proposition to integrate solar with batteries and combine it with home automation during the development and construction process.\u00a0\u00a0This creates residences with back-up power, lower electricity bills, and a more efficient energy ecosystem.\u00a0\u00a0Williams cites a forthcoming project in Sydney involving 75 homes with solar, batteries, and Amazon or Google

lower capital costs, he notes, but there is so much additional value to be gained by adding batteries to the mix that he has embraced storage as a key differentiator.\u00a0\u00a0Williams indicates that the battery is the most expensive part of the system, representing approximately 55% to 65% of the total costs.\u00a0\u00a0However, he says the additional cost is justified by the value creation potential from the lithium iron phosphate sonnen technology that is stable and warrantied for 10,000 cycles.", "The company installed its first home battery system in early 2016; today over 95% of its customers request storage, including some looking to retrofit batteries into existing systems.\u00a0With the sonnenFlat product, he comments, \u201c70-80% of customers pay upfront for the system, based on our demographic.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The solar-storage combinations can also be financed by a third party and set up to be cash flow positive (relative to the electric bill one would have paid) from day one, and the economics are attractive enough that many customers can own the system outright in as little as seven or eight years.", "With the various activities the storage systems perform (including the storage and release of rooftop solar for self-consumption as well as the rapid and often more shallow cycling necessary to support sale of services to the grid through sonnen), the battery averaged 1.7 daily cycles in the first year, but he indicates they could comfortably accommodate as many as 2.7 cycles daily under the existing warranty.", "sonnen\u2019s offering", "sonnen\u2019s Dunn characterizes the sonnenFlat product as being similar in nature to the company\u2019s offerings in other countries.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of getting electricity from the utility or a competitive retail supplier, consumers pay a fixed price upfront, and a flat monthly fee in exchange for a fixed energy allowance.\u00a0\u00a0In Australia, there are three different plans, based on annual consumption levels: 7,500 kWh for a smaller residential dwelling with three or fewer inhabitants; 10,000 kWh for a somewhat larger family; and 12,500 kWh for a family and dwelling with a more extensive building footprint.\u00a0\u00a0Having a fleet of batteries to deploy at sonnen\u2019s disposal, Dunn says, \u201cenables us to do a raft of other thing in relation to selling energy on the open market,\u201d which helps the company offer a more attractive price to the customer.", "sonnen\u2019s CEO Ostermann explains that a critical part of making this value proposition work is the company\u2019s\u00a0proprietary Virtual Power Plant software, developed by a Berlin-based team of experienced specialists.\u00a0The company\u2019s software\u00a0constantly observes critical parameters such as grid frequency and can manage each battery\u2019s charge and discharge power separately if necessary. Based on those measurements an intelligent algorithm in sonnen\u2019s software\u00a0determines how long and how deep\u00a0to dispatch each storage asset to either inject into or absorb power from the grid.", "If directed to do so, for example, the batteries can react to grid frequency deviations or other defined signals in a matter of seconds.\u00a0As markets and opportunities grow, there is always room to add more features. \u201cWe are investing heavily in deploying\u00a0this piece of software\u00a0into further use-cases,\u201d Ostermann explains, and the company has made\u00a0its Virtual Power Plant software\u00a0compatible with utilities\u2019 systems: Utilities\u00a0can\u00a0purchase a Virtual Power Plant software licence in a package with sonnenBatteries and\u00a0dispatch\u00a0their\u00a0sonnen assets.", "The voice of the customer", "Stephen Fenech, the inaugural sonnenFlat customer loves what he has experienced so far.\u00a0\u00a0He\u2019s a tech journalist (just what one might expect from an early adopter) and comments that his first meeting with Natural Solar took place on July 1, 2017, which also happened to be the day that new electricity tariffs were posted, increasing costs, he says, by 20%.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSo it made clear I needed to be doing something.\u00a0\u00a0I needed to step out of this cycle.\u201d He heard about the impending launch of the sonnenFlat product from the Natural Solar team and wrote about it.\u00a0\u00a0After investigating further, he ultimately decided to take the plunge in October of 2017.", "So how does it work?\u00a0The panels sit on his roof and, the battery is in the laundry.", "\u201cIt sits against a wall only 20 centimeters deep and it\u2019s not intrusive.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s connected to the Internet.\u00a0\u00a0The panels work during the day and I use power they produce, while excess power goes into my battery.\u00a0\u00a0All sonnen owners are linked, so we are all part of this power plant.\u201d", "He pays a flat fee of $40 per month, which he likes.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt is predictable, there are no nasty little bill shocks and surprises \u2013 it\u2019s cheaper than my cellphone plan.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0And like many early adopters, he\u2019s an effective disciple.", "I have showed it to a lot of friends and neighbors\u2026Everybody thinks \u2018I\u2019d like to do this, but I don\u2019t know where to start.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0So I showed it, and explained what was involved and roughly what the price would be.\u00a0A couple of my friends now own systems.", "And he enjoys the savings.\u00a0He no longer pays a variable local utility bill.

This is particularly useful if your roof is shady or has a variety of pitches because these conditions mean that your panels may receive different levels of solar radiance. Thus, if you are trying to optimise power across a group of panels that have different levels of solar irradiance, then there is going to be a level of inefficiency.", "A SolarEdge DC Optimiser will also make it possible for you to monitor your solar array on a panel level.

It\u2019s a little bit tricky, so let us break it down for you:", "What is net metering?", "When energy is generated by the solar panels on your roof, the power will first be sent to your house to be used by your appliances, lights, etc. Any excess energy that isn\u2019t used will then be sent to the electricity grid and you\u2019ll be paid a rebate for supplying this power.", "Net metering measures how much energy you take from the grid as well as how much energy your solar system puts back in and charges or pays you accordingly (depending on whether you have used more or less energy that your panels generated).", "What is gross metering?", "When energy is generated by the solar panels on the roof of your property, it\u2019s sent directly to the electricity grid where it will be available for use by anyone connected to the grid.", "When your property needs power, it will draw the energy for this directly from the grid. Gross metering is measured with two separate meters (one measuring the energy that is feed into the grid and the other measure the energy used by your property) so it\u2019s easy to assess what comes in and out.", "Gross metering is only available in ACT and NSW, and at the end of 2016 all households in NSW that are currently on gross metering will be required to change over to net metering.", "What are Feed In Tariffs?", "The Feed In Tariff is the rebate a home owner is paid in return for the energy they feed into the electricity grid, and it\u2019s determined state by state. The tariff is paid partly by the state government and partly by the energy companies that are using the power you provide.", "The Gross Feed In Tariff in NSW ranges from $0.20/kWh \u2013 $0.60/kWh, while the Net Feed In Tariff varies across the country from $0.05/kWh \u2013 $0.08/kWh.", "Can I add more solar panels to my existing solar system to get a bigger rebate?", "Yes, you can get the rebate for a solar panel system of up to 10kW \u2013 but, unfortunately, you can\u2019t start a solar energy farm in your backyard.", "How does the Tesla Powerwall help with metering?", "The Tesla Powerwall makes a huge financial difference because it allows households to store power for future usage instead of selling it back to the grid.", "This is important because, while you do get a tariff in return for the power that you provide to the grid, there is a good chance that any power you later draw from the grid will be significantly more expensive (especially if you need it during the peak times of 2-8pm from Monday to Friday).", "So storing up the power your solar system generates in the first place (in a Tesla Powerwall) and having it ready to go for free at any time will help you to save money in the long run.", "So, which is best: Gross or Net?", "Generally speaking, net metering with solar energy is the best way to go \u2013 not only because it is the only system available in most states and territories in Australia but also because, when combined with a Tesla Powerwall, it\u2019s the system most likely to provide you with a continual source of clean, affordable energy.", "If you have any other questions about metering, feel free to get in touch with us at Natural Solar any time and we would be happy to talk you through it.

There are some definite naysayers out there (we\u2019re not going to name names) who are motivated for various reasons to speak badly about solar energy. And there\u2019s no doubt that the technology related to solar energy has come a long way in the past few years. But the reality is that solar energy is now an efficient, sustainable, reliable source of good, clean power and it is undoubtedly going to be a big part of the world\u2019s energy future.", "Myth #5: I\u2019ll never be able to recoup my investment in solar energy", "Obviously this one depends on your particular circumstances, but many people believe it will take at least a couple of decades to pay off their solar energy system, which is simply not true. For one thing, installing a solar system on your home is a good way to instantly increase the value of the property. But, even more importantly, the constantly rising energy prices in Australia and the affordability of solar mean that you can pay off your solar system (including one that features the amazing Tesla Powerwall) in well under a decade.", "Myth #6: Solar energy is just for rich people", "This one is connected to the debunked myth above and, again, isn\u2019t correct. The release of the Tesla Powerwall in Australia has been a particularly important part clearing this myth up, because solar batteries of this calibre and efficiency have never before been so accessible or affordable for anybody, not just the wealthy. Undoubtedly, there is a significant outlay required when you install the system, but if you crunch the numbers you will discover it is possible to pay off the initial cost in a few short years, leaving you with a future filled with lower energy bills.", "Myth #7: A solar system will ruin my roof", "Whether your concern is aesthetic (that the solar panels will look ugly on your property) or practical (that the panels will somehow cause your roof to leak or collapse), you can rest easy. Solar energy systems offered by Natural Solar are not only beautiful to look at (if we do say so ourselves) but they are designed to actually protect and preserve the sections of roof they cover.

It does this by performing critical calculations which are algorithms of differential equation optimisation that use a combination of external inputs (such as the meter and panels) and what the inverter is sensing at its point of connection.", "The inverter will then tell the customer through a user interface (such as an online portal or an LCD display) exactly how much power the system is producing, as well as how much total energy is being produced over the lifetime of the system. This function is critical because if you are a home or business owner and have a solar system on your property, you will want to know immediately if there\u2019s a fault in the system.", " The third and final function of the inverter is to make sure that both of the first two things happen in a safe and secure way.
