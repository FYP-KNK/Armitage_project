At the time I just saw it as a crutch to lean on in social situations. Eventually it became a crutch to lean on when I was alone because I didn\u2019t like being alone.

And that she could be a mother to my kids and give them the life that they deserved. That\u2019s how low my self-esteem was, and our family was a shambles.", "It got to the stage where I was dying I was slowly drinking myself to death.

My husband stood by me through everything. He was so supportive.", "And I have to admit, he was very skeptical at the beginning.

And that\u2019s normal \u2013 it\u2019s very normal for people to be skeptical. So he was nervous and he, just like me, took things one day at a time. Every day that went by was another day without alcohol and was another day that he gave himself permission to be excited. Within a few weeks he was equally excited and he was sharing in that excitement with me. Then my kids. Their personalities changed, because they were very little at the time.

Every person is worthy of treatment.", "There is a brilliant beautiful life out there if you can find it in your heart to get better to just make that decision, to just take that step.

If I had to take oral medication [oral naltrexone], I knew that I wouldn\u2019t take it. I wouldn\u2019t stick to it, I\u2019d give up. So the benefit of the implant being inside the body means that it couldn\u2019t be tampered with by me, and once it was in there it took care of the physical cravings for alcohol.", "And this was very very important because once those physical cravings were taken care of, the withdrawals were taken care of, I then had the room, I had the space to focus on the emotional reasons behind my addiction and that was very very important. A lot of people think that addiction is simply about stopping the behavior and it\u2019s not. The behavior is a symptom of a greater problem. So once I took care of the physical addiction \u2013 the cravings for alcohol \u2013 I was then able to move on to the emotional.", "And I moved on to that by undergoing life coaching.

I\u2019m working on it. But it is nowhere near as bad as it used to be. I actually look in the mirror now and I like the person looking back at me. Now that is a huge huge deal because when I was drinking I didn\u2019t even look in the mirror. You know what? In the last year of my drinking I didn\u2019t even know what I looked like \u2013 I avoided mirrors, I didn\u2019t want to look at myself and now I do.

Similar to a muscle that increases in strength after repeated weight lifting, the brain is trained to engage in particular thought processes or behaviors as they occur more frequently. The brain builds a physical pathway for electrical impulses, which reinforces the habit", "[iii]", ".", "Although this process is applicable to virtually any behavior, it is particularly powerful when it relates to the release of dopamine: the body\u2019s primary \u2018pleasure and reward\u2019 hormone. Originally dopamine was the biochemical that drove humans to seek survival; especially in regards to food, water and sexual impulses", "[iv]", ".

Complex environmental and genetic variables have been shown to influence which of these pathways is active in developing a substance dependency or addiction", "[viii]", ".", "The first of these is physical dependence \u2013 an experience where the body requires the substance in order to function normally.

However, unlike physical dependency, the body does not seem to release less dopamine with each encounter.

Through active rewiring of thoughts, feelings and behaviors, \u201cthe brain is able to recruit new neural networks\u201d and create new recovery loops free of the addictive behavior", "[x]", ".", "\u201cIt is important to acknowledge that substance abuse does alter the biochemistry of the brain, and this does play a big role in developing and maintaining addictive behaviors. However, you can never fully destroy the brain\u2019s neural pathways.\u201d Small triggers can cause the old pathways to fire up again, and prompt a relapse. This is why complete abstinence is strongly encouraged in addition to psychological treatments", "[xi]", ".", "\u00a0", "Peter highlights the value in mindfulness and meditation as one technique that can be utilized to rebuild and activate healthy neural networks.", "\u00a0", "\u201cMany people experiencing addiction or substance dependency feel that they cannot overcome emotional distress without the addictive substance for their coping mechanism. However, mindfulness, meditation and thought restructuring exercises equip you with tools to be able to \u2018ride the wave\u2019 so to speak without engaging in the destructive habit.\u201d", "It is very important that people have a comprehensive treatment approach. Peter says, \u201cYou will not recover just by trying to abstain, as your brain will always try and lead you back down the well worn path that is your neural network. At the same time, you cannot build new neural networks if you are still engaging with the old ones \u2013 abstinence is a big key to success.\u201d For those who experience a physical dependency, trying to go \u2018cold turkey\u2019 by yourself can be very dangerous, and a medical support component is required.", "The Banyans Health and Wellness is a comprehensive, medically supported residence that provides all of the treatment approaches outlined above.
