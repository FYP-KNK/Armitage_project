Admission to an acute stroke unit may play a role in the increased survival seen in women.\u201d", "\u201cThere was also a hint that women were more likely to be taking blood pressure lowering medication, but less likely to have been prescribed blood thinning, glucose-lowering or lipid-lowering medication prior to their stroke than men.

It is a global public health study into acute ischaemic stroke aiming to improve the treatment of stroke which affects 15 million people worldwide, causing premature death and disability.

Global Burden of Disease Study has estimated that about 2.35 lakh people died of kidney failure in India in 2016, making chronic kidney disease as the ninth leading cause of death in India, having risen from 15th rank in 2005.\u00a0Treatment of advanced kidney disease that requires dialysis is expensive. Previous studies have shown that most people with kidney failure in India die without receiving an appropriate treatment, mostly because of financial reasons. RACHIS was the first program that removed this financial barrier, allowing the poor to access treatment. The National dialysis program announced in 2014 envisages setting up dialysis centres in all districts of India.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n", "\nThe study found that of all people who started haemodialysis during the period of evaluation RACHIS, about 10 percent had died and another 36 percent had stopped coming to dialysis centres after six months and 10 per cent of them were reported dead.

He said these programs had growth rates well in excess of CPI, and at the moment well in excess of the growth in tax revenue.\n", "\nTwo things could prompt Government action on creating a sustainable health system for Australia, he said.\n", "\n\u201cFirstly, the Commonwealth Government has a medium term fiscal challenge which will force it to spend considerable political capital educating the population to the idea that resources are limited.\n", "\n\u201cSecondly, the same government is committed to a fundamental review of the federal system, leading to a white paper during this term. \u00a0As soon as you start that process you hit the health system, and that will throw up an opportunity to look at the issues through a different lens.\u201d\n", "\nHe said Australia should look to Dutch health reforms as a path forward, he said, as had been suggested by the 2009 National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report.\n", "\nVlado Perkovic said health reform should begin now, as changes could take years to take effect. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is not what\u2019s being spent now, it\u2019s how much we will be spending as percentage of GDP in 10 or 20 years.\u201d\n", "\nHe said it was important not just to rein in spiralling health costs, but also to improve the quality of health care, and reduce the colossal amount of waste. He pointed to a survey carried out by the ANZ Intensive Care Society, that found only five per cent of treatments given to an intensive care patient were supported by reasonable evidence.\n", "\nSteve Hambleton said that Australia\u2019s health care crisis was currently hidden behind comparisons to other countries, where the percentage of health spending was higher than in Australia. For example, Canada spends 12 per cent of GDP on health, compared to Australia\u2019s nine per cent.\n", "\nWith the Australian Government saying it currently cannot afford to spend more on health, Dr Hambleton said the key was being smarter with health funding by concentrating on programmes and services where there is clear evidence of patient benefit. He said health care costs were rising because of an ageing population, more people with chronic and complex conditions, and high costs of new technology and hospital care.\n", "\nAndrew Wilson said the crunch point that would finally prompt action on health care reform would come when it was recognised that Australia\u2019s states, which have very limited revenue raising capacity, could no longer afford to run hospitals.\n", "\nHe was also concerned he said, about the affordability of healthcare for consumers, with rising out-of-pocket expenses, and a two-tiered health system that saw insured consumers able to access more extensive health care through the private system than those who used the public health system, even though 60+% of private health care costs were funded directly or indirectly by the public purse.\n", "\nHe suggested that it was important to look at the costs of the whole health care system and not just the public sector services. \u201cPrivate health care services are experiencing the highest growth in the Australian health care system and if government is concerned about the total cost of health care, it needs to have strategies to look at this and not just to transfer these increasing costs to individuals through increased out-of-pocket expenses\u201d.\n", "\nSteve Irons said a current priority for the Government was a sustainable health system. \u201cResearch is a major part of our health system.\u201d He said consultation was an important part of the Government\u2019s approach, and it would be necessary to engage with the health industry. \u201cWe have to be mindful that health is such a big part of the Budget, and we have to get it right.\u201d\n", "\n            \n                            02/04/2014\n            \n      \n    ", "Level 5, 1 King Street", "\n        Newtown NSW 2042 Australia", "\n        Tel: ", "+61 2 8052 4300", "\n        Fax: +61 2 8052 4301", "\n        ", "info@georgeinstitute.org", "Subscribe to our E-newsletter", "The George Institute acknowledges the Gadigal People of the Eora Nation as the Traditional Custodians of the land on which our Australia office and Global Headquarters are built.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children experience burns at least double the rate of other children. Having consistent access to high quality care is fundamental to good outcomes in burns care.\n", "\nScald injuries are the most common type of burn injuries in Aboriginal Children, which is consistent for other children, followed by flame burns, such as from campfires, and contact burns.\n", "\nStudy leader Professor Rebecca Ivers, of The George Institute and The University of Sydney has been funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council to conduct a four year study examining burns in Aboriginal children in four Australian states (NSW, SA, NT and QLD).\n", "\nThis week at The George Institute for Global Health in Sydney, the study's first meeting was held between leading researchers, clinicians, health economists and policy makers, as well as community leaders, from Westmead, Brisbane, Adelaide, Ceduna and the Northern Territory.\n", "\nInvestigators on the team will examine the care received (including cost), look at the relationship between care and outcome, and identify barriers and facilitators to appropriate care. They will look at what support services are needed for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and their families, and follow-up care for burns, including where and how best treatment could be delivered and by whom.\n", "\nProfessor Ivers said: \"Our aim is to work with clinicians, policy makers and the community to develop a \u2018blueprint\u2019 for reform of services, to ensure Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children receive appropriate and cost-effective care, and inform service delivery and future intervention trials.\"\n", "\nThe outcomes will also have relevance to delivery of other specialist health care services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, in both urban and rural settings.\n", "\n\"Now we are beginning the work, we needed to ensure we are asking the right questions, and therefore able to generate research of relevance to all stakeholders. This roundtable provided an important opportunity to bring together experts and leaders to identify key questions for the study, and begin an ongoing conversation about opportunities for improvement in burn care.\"\n", "\nKurt Towers, Director of Aboriginal Health, and former Manager of the Aboriginal Burns Program for South Australia Health said: \u201cThe significance and devastation of burn injury in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population is often overshadowed by other priorities in Aboriginal health.
