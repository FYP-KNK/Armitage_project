Registrants will also learn recent advances in the management and identification of non-odontogenic and neuralgic pain\\, and be taught methods of pain\\, behavior and anxiety control for difficult patients. Extracted teeth and nonsurgical and surgical models will be used by participants to practice endodontic nonsurgical and surgical techniques\\, and lecture materials and videos will be presented to guide participants through the procedures. \\nA number of live patient demonstrations in endodontic management of the open apex\\, location of the MB2 canal\\, post removal\\, endodontic retreatment\\, and crown preparation of the compromised tooth will also be covered. Intravenous sedation will also be carried out for some of these live patient demonstrations. Operating microscopes will be available for all hands-on exercises. \\nParticipation is designed to broaden clinician\u2019s scope of practice and achieve a more advanced knowledge and abilities in endodontics. \\nDelegates will complete assessments and web based tutorials. Upon completion of the program\\, delegates will receive a special certificate of completion of Mini Residency in Endodontics. \\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\nTopics include\\n\\nDiagnosis\\, pre-op assessment and multidisciplinary treatment planning\\nModern concepts in endodontic access design and location of calcified and MB2 canals\\nUse of Cone Beam CT technology in endodontics\\nCurrent concepts in chemo-mechanical disinfection and obturation with a focus on hybrid warm vertical compaction\\nPrinciples of contemporary endodontic retreatment\\nFractured instrument removal\\nManagement of the open apex\\nUpdate on dental trauma management\\nPrinciples of contemporary endodontic microsurgery\\nPrinciples of crown lengthening\\nComplications and risk management in Endodontics\\nManagement of endodontic misadventures\\nNon-odontogenic Pain and it\u2019s identification and management\\nIV sedation and pain control\\nLive patient demonstrations in management of the open apex\\, endodontic surgery\\, retreatment and crown preparation of a compromised tooth\\n\\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\nLearning Objectives\\n\\nUnderstand how to use the operating microscope\\nUnderstand how to treatment plan the endodontic case\\nUnderstand how to assess CBCT scans\\nUnderstand how to manage complex endodontic cases\\nUnderstand how to manage dental trauma\\nUnderstand the principles of endodontic retreatment\\nUnderstand the principles of endodontic microsurgery\\nUnderstand risk assessment and how to manage complications in endodontics\\nUnderstand crown lengthening and how to restore a compromised tooth\\nUnderstand the different materials used in nonsurgical and surgical endodontics and the indications for these materials\\nAppreciate the complexity of pain control in endodontics\\nUnderstand the difficulties in identifying non-odontogenic pain\\n\\n\u00a0 \\nPresented by:\\n\\nDr Mehdi Rahimi\\,\u00a0Dr Geoffrey Young\\,\u00a0A/Prof. Mark Evans\\,\u00a0Dr Mark Johnstone\\,\u00a0Dr Ehsan Mellati\\,\u00a0Adj A/Prof. Chankhrit Sathorn\\,\u00a0Dr David Barnard\\,\u00a0Dr Ben Lee\\, Prof. Paul Abbott\\,\u00a0Prof. Ove Peters\\,\u00a0Dr Russell Vickers\\, Dr Nour Eldin Tarraf\\,\u00a0Dr Firoz Vellani\\, Dr Sami Haddad\\, Dr Mark Stenhouse\\,\u00a0Dr Langley Tasmania and Dr Harry Mohan \\n\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\nOther Information\\nThe course will run over 4 modules\\, each module being two full days.

This is achieved with enhanced bonding to tooth structure\\, predictable success and no laboratory cost. \\nThe initial part of this course aims to show the participants how to practice cosmetic dentistry in its simplest form including how to start a cosmetic case; what are the limitations and how do we overcome this. \\nUsing these techniques\\, most cases can be accomplished with minimum tooth intervention\\, no local anaesthesia and at a reduced cost to the patient in one visit. The technique can be applied to all ages and the results can be quite astounding. Patients appreciate the one visit procedure and the immediate aesthetic and functional improvement. \\nThis comprehensive hands-on course will also cover all aspects of application of composite technology to clinical practice. \\nThe day aims to achieve improved knowledge and clinical skills in application of composites and enhance the confidence of the practitioner in treatment of simple to complex cases using direct composites to achieve optimal function and aesthetic result. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClick here to register!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLearning Objectives\\n\\nLearn\\, understand and apply the principles of contemporary smile design: how it affects facial aesthetics.\\nDiagnostic importance of composite mock up/ direct intraoral Kessling set up\\nHow to balance the smile: The face.
