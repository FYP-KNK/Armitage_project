Once the tread depth wears down to 1.6mm, the legal minimum limit, this could indicate that your vehicle may no longer maintain a good grip on the road.

You can use them individually, laying them flat on the ground and growing plants in the centre, or stacking them together. You can also cut them in half or hang the whole ring on your exterior walls to make hanging flower beds and paint them to add a touch of colour. When using tyres as planters however, you must remember that they are only good for non-edible plants as the rubber material contains chemicals that the plants can absorb.", "#2. PLAY STRUCTURE", "Another common recycling idea we may be familiar with are children\u2019s swings made from old tyres. Other ideas are seesaws made by cutting tyres in half with the round side as the base, and sand pits with cut tyres as borders.

GARDEN DECORATIONS", "Because of their rubber material, tyres are quite bendable which makes them easy to shape into various designs.

You can then paint them with different colours for a more artistic and decorative touch.", "#4. MULCH", "Aside from garden decorations, old tyres have more use for gardeners.

Mulch is beneficial for plants as it can hold water and prevent the growth of weeds, thereby helping plants grow healthier.", "#5. OUTDOOR PATH/STAIRWAY", "If you\u2019re living near a slope or if a portion of your garden is a slope, you can use them as steps.

Some artistic hands have turned these vehicle parts into beautiful furniture pieces. The rings are stacked together and topped with glass or wooden boards to make tables. They are also made into chairs and ottomans that make wonderful additions to lawns and gardens.", "#7. WALL PROTECTION/BARRIERS", "The treads may thin out and become unsuitable for the road, but they are still thick enough to provide a layer of protection for surfaces around your home. You can carefully cut them into several pieces and cover certain areas of your walls especially the lower portions. The rubber can protect your walls against direct surface damages.", "#8.

Based on various test drives, the difference in performance between budget and quality tyres are not at all subtle, but significant. On dry roads, cheap tyres have been found to perform satisfactorily. But on wet surfaces, proper handling, brake and grip are often difficult for them. This can be due to the rubber compounds used, as well as the design of the individual tread blocks. The cheaper ones are also not optimised for quiet running, which means you can expect some noise while on the road, affecting your driving experience.", "When Splurging is Smarter", "Leading brands such as Bridgestone, Continental, Michelin, Kumho and Pirelli tyres, can cost more initially.

However, many vehicle owners think that this service offers little value and only contributes to their expenses. But if you ask mechanics, mobile tyre service specialists, and even carmakers, all of them will tell you that wheel rotation can have significant long-term benefits.", "Tyre rotation is basically the practice of rearranging and moving each of your vehicle\u2019s wheels from one position to another. As a preventative maintenance task, it can help in equalising tread wear and thus, ensure a longer life and consistent performance.", "To understand why this service is important, let us first examine how the weight or load of our vehicle is distributed among our tyres.", "In rear-wheel drive cars, weight distribution between front and back wheels is typically balanced, close to 50/50. On the other hand, in front-wheel drive vehicles, the front wheels typically carry majority of the weight, with a typical distribution of 60:40 from front to rear. The result of this is that the front tyres take the bulk of the damage, often degrading at almost twice the rate of rear tyres. Add to that the stress that comes from braking and you\u2019ll end up with worn-out front wheels in no time. Tyre rotation is the remedy to this problem.", "When you rotate your tyres regularly, especially for front-wheel drive cars, you allow even tread wear which is critical to ensuring maximum tyre life. Tyres that wear at the same rate also ensure a safer and smoother driving experience.", "The frequency of this task depends on the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Generally, manufacturers recommend wheels to be rotated every 8,000 to 12,000 kilometres or when uneven tread wear is evident. Rotation patterns also vary and depend on a few factors, such as whether you have directional or non-directional tyres, and if your vehicle is front-wheel, all-wheel, rear-wheel or four-wheel drive.", "Common rotation patterns include the Rearward Cross, the Forward Cross, Front to Rear, X pattern, and Side to Side.", "Tyre rotation may sound simple at first glance, but it actually takes specialists to ensure the tyres are rotated and fitted properly.
