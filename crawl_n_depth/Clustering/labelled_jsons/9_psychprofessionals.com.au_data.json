As a parent myself who has worked therapeutically with children and parents over the past 8 years I have come to find the hardest thing to first overcome is the parents\u2019 insecurity about how well they parent. In all my time as a therapist (or a parent) I have never come across a parent that felt they were doing enough for their children (myself included). Of all the ways we identify and judge ourselves (and others) few factors weigh as heavily as how we see ourselves as parents. In our society, to be considered a \u201cbad\u201d parent is one of the worst labels a person can have. As such most people put great pressure on themselves to be a \u201cgood\u201d parent. \u00a0This pressure, while it can be a good motivator, can also be quite disruptive to the child and exhausting for the parent, the consequences of which can lead to increased tension and stress, poor boundaries, and increased emotional outbursts (from the child and the parent) to name a few. But what is a \u201cGood\u201d Parent, and what is good parenting?", "To answer this, we need to look at what good parenting is not!! Firstly, good parenting is not \u201ccontrolling\u201d your child! No one has control of their child, the child controls the child. Effective parenting guides and encourages a child to make good decisions regarding behavior in different contexts.", "Secondly, a child throwing a tantrum is not always a reflection of bad parenting. Healthy and happy children will push boundaries and tantrum from time to time. Further to this, some children simply have different temperaments and will respond to different parenting strategies differently.", "\u00a0", "Finally, good parenting is not being calm and happy all the time (or even most of the time). Let\u2019s face It, kids can be obnoxious, loud, irrational, and overly emotional at the best of times. It is not realistic to expect anyone to endure this without getting upset to some degree. This does not mean that you do not love your children or that you are a bad parent. It is important however, for us as parents to teach our children how to manage difficult emotions, and we cannot do this by helping them to avoid difficult emotions, and we don\u2019t do it by staying calm all the time ourselves. Children learn to manage difficulty in two main ways, a) by watching their parents manage difficult emotions and b) by dealing with difficult emotions themselves.", "The reason people put so much pressure on themselves as parents is because a) they love their kids and only want what is best for them, and b) they do not want to be seen as a bad parent. Firstly, we are never going to be able to give our children everything, and when we do not meet this unrealistic expectation we are left with feelings of shame, guilt, inadequacy, etc. which only makes it harder to provide the care we would like to provide. Secondly, given there is no clearly defined measure of good/bad parenting people will always put pressure on themselves to be better to avoid that label. The problem is, being a good parent is a value, not a goal. We never get to check \u201cbe a good parent\u201d off a list of things to do. It should be viewed as a value that helps guide our goals, behaviours, and relationships with our children. It is important that we have realistic expectations of ourselves as parents and understand that having \u201cbe a good parent\u201d as a value that we constantly strive towards is what makes a good parent.", "Adam has a broad range of experience including working with children, adolescents and their families.

I\u2019m here to explain the important things you need to know about \u2018benzos\u2019 in the hopes to spread awareness about the aspects that not enough people are talking about.", "What are Benzos?", "When we say \u2018benzos\u2019 we are referring to a class of prescription medication called Benzodiazepines (you can see why we shorten it huh? Such a mouthful!). In Australia, almost 7 million prescriptions for benzos are issued every year. This medication is generally prescribed for two reasons: 1.) as a sleeping tablet or; 2.) as a tranquilliser to assist with anxiety.", "How do I know if my medication is a benzo?", "There are a few really commonly prescribed benzos that you may have heard of- Valium (Diazepam), Xanax (Alprazolam) or Temaze (Temazepam) just to name a few. The best way to know if your prescription medication is a benzo is to ask your General Practitioner (GP). However, these days we have a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips, so feel free to search the name of your medication online and you will find information about the class of drug. Keep in mind that any information you read online about advice or side effects should be discussed with your GP.", "How do I use benzos safely?", "The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners released some new guidelines for GPs in 2015 with the aim of improving patient care. These guidelines state that benzos should not be the first line of treatment and that non-drug therapies should also be explored. What does this mean? Basically, it means that if you are having difficulties with sleep or anxiety, other treatments such as psychological therapy should be explored first or in conjunction with medication. Why? Well the guidelines also state that benzos should generally be regarded as a ", "short-term", " therapeutic option, and if used daily, rarely should be continued beyond four weeks. So you\u2019re really going to have to learn to manage your symptoms without medication if you can only use benzos for such a short period of time.", "What are the risks associated with taking benzos?", "As with all medication, it is a good idea to be aware of the possible side effects of benzos prior to taking them. That being said, most people experience few side effects when taking them. The biggest risk is becoming dependent on benzos if taking them for longer than four weeks. What\u2019s so bad about becoming dependent? There\u2019s a few problems with this:", "\n\u2013 You never really learn to manage your underlying symptoms.", "\n\u2013 Your body becomes used to having the medication in its\u2019 system, and may start to require a higher dosage in order for it to continue being effective.", "\n\u2013 If you choose to resist taking a higher dosage, you may start to feel withdrawal symptoms even though you\u2019re still taking it.", "\n\u2013 If you attempt to cut back or stop taking it, you may experience some unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.", "How do I know if I am dependent on this medication?", "There are some tell-tale signs that perhaps you are becoming dependent on your benzo medication if you have been taking them long-term. Ironically enough, they can start to cause the symptoms they are designed to prevent- i.e. anxiety and difficulty sleeping. If you feel you cannot cope without taking them, if you experience increased discomfort close to the time of your next pill, or if the medication is not having the same effect as when you first started taking it, these may be indicators that you are dependent on this medication.", "Should they be banned altogether?", "Benzos are usually very effective at managing anxiety and improving sleep. If used short term or every now and then, and used in conjunction with psychologically therapy, they are generally quite safe. Banning them altogether would probably be a bit extreme, but we do need to ensure that the word is spread about their potential risks so that they are used in the safest possible way.", "Should I stop taking this medication if my GP has prescribed it?", "Definitely not!!! If you have been taking benzos for months or even years, it can be very dangerous to go cold-turkey and stop taking your medication altogether. A slow reduction in the medication is necessary, and only to be performed under the guidance of your GP and with support from your psychologist.", "Where do I get help if I am concerned about dependence?", "There are several places to get help:", "\n\u2013 Speak to your GP about your concerns.", "\n\u2013 See a psychologist or mental health practitioner for assistance in managing your symptoms.
