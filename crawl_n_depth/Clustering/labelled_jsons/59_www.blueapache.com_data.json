If we consider that voice packets are red cars on the freeway, we will need to ensure that red cars are not slowed down. When this occurs with voice packets, it will affect call quality.", "In Australia, the average contention ratio of most Internet Service Providers (ISP) is 50:1. What this means is that up to 50 broadband customers are sharing the same bandwidth at any given time. In the previous example, this would be similar to a large group of motorists sharing the same road.", "Some ISPs may promote a lower contention ratio. However, whilst traveling from the ISP to a SIP Trunk provider, there are various hops along the route where traffic traverses over other ISP networks in order to get to the intended destination.

Without QoS, all traffic on a network is viewed as the same. Thus, streaming a YouTube video would have the same claim to the available bandwidth as an ongoing voice call.

Encoding and decoding the voice stream at each end may introduce latency (delays). A loss of voice quality may also result from the use of low quality codecs. While some modern codecs work well over the internet, it still adds a layer of latency.

An email from a legitimate address will often use the same address as the website. For example, an email from blueAPACHE would be from name@blueapache.com.

Is it from an organisation that you do not normally deal with or are not expecting to hear from? If it mention flights you may have never booked, parcels you did not send or refunds you are not expecting, then be very cautious. If possible, contact the sending organisation to confirm if they sent it to you.", "3) Does the email contain external links? If the link says one thing but points to a different server, it is likely to be malicious. One way to check this without clicking the link is to hover your mouse over the link. A pop up will show you where the link redirects to.", "4) Is the website domain not quite right? Fake domains closely resemble actual ones, but will have small differences \u2013\u00a0for instance, www.linkedlin.com or www.facbook.com. http://www.whois.com/whois/ is a free service that you can use to find who the domain is registered to. It only\u00a0takes a few seconds to use and could save you weeks of inconvenience.", "5) Does the email contain any attachments? If the attachment is a file with a .exe, .cmd or .bat extension, it could be a malicious program that will install code onto your computer when run. Check with the sender if the file was sent by them and what it does upon running.", "6) Do the graphics look different? Scammers try to imitate real organisations as closely as possible by using the same logo, graphics and colours, but it will often be of poor quality. When poorly executed, some of them also contain spelling or grammatical errors.", "\u00a0", "What should you do if you have received a malicious email?", "If you think the email you\u2019ve received could be malicious, get an expert to check it out.
