While the predominant use will be for the Landfilling of residual dry wastes and limited regulated wastes generated from the construction and demolition industry, there will be ancillary operations such as resource recovery and recycling by mechanical and labour means, to minimize the amount of reusable material being disposed of in the landfill cell.

Due to the current mining operation working multiple shifts, and with larger and more equipment, it is anticipated the noise emissions from proposed facility will reduce, even though more road going trucks will frequent this site. Noise studies are being completed to verify this.", "There will be addition visual and noise buffers installed in the form screening utilizing local native tree and shrub species. These will be placed in rehabilitated areas between the operation and residential zones.", "Dust", "Dust will be controlled in a number of ways. There will be a large area of the site rehabilitated so that vegetation covering the once bare land reduces windblown dust from these areas.", "The dust generated from traffic areas will be controlled by the use of selected road topping, traffic management, and frequent watering by the onsite water truck.
