", "VENEZUELA'S MAJOR FORESTRY PROJECTS", "(Excerpted from American Embassy-Caracas Report)", "Summary", "Venezuela has begun a number of large forestry projects to satisfy the fiber requirements of that nation's pulp and paper Mills. Raw material needs are particularly acute with respect to secondary fibers for the paper and board industry, long-fibered pulp for newsprint, and softwood timber for use in the construction industry. The pulp and paper industry is heavily dependent on imports, with 83 percent of all pulp requirements being imported. As these projects reach maturity, opportunities for U.S. businessmen will arise in construction, consulting/engineering, and equipment sales.", "Because of current pulp, short fiber, and timber shortages, Venezuela has embarked on an ambitious planting/development program for Caribbean pine and eucalyptus in the southern Anzoategui and northern Monagas State areas, respectively. The objective is to convert the Sabanas into a gigantic forestry and industry complex capable of supporting several pulp Mills that would not only supply domestic needs but also provide valuable export income. The two major government agencies responsible for these developments are Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) and Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CNR).", "Uverito ", "Project ", "The Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "was begun in 1969 by Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana with the intention of planting 218 million trees on 150,000 hectares by 1985, in order to produce long fiber pulp-mainly for the production of newsprint. Long fiber pulp is currently imported at an annual rate of 80,000 tons. Caribbean pine (Hondurensis), imported from Guatemala and other Central American countries, is the type of tree being planted. To date, about 80 million trees have been planted on 110,000 acres, with an additional 110 million planned for 1984. Plans are being made to harvest trees for pulp production in 1984. Eventually, 4,000 hectares out of every 10,000 will be harvested for pulp, with the remainder being conserved for timber production (maturity: about 10 to 15 years). By 1986, CVG expects to reach the 4,000 hectare level, with an expected yield of 180 cubic meters per hectare. CVG will require forestry equipment and technical assistance for the extraction process.", "In preparation for the harvesting period, CVG has plans to build a pulp mill capable of producing 200,000 tons annually, which should be completed by the 1984 deadline. Decisions on outside equity participation and exact composition have yet to be made, but the mill will be separately managed from the rest of the forestry ", "proj", "ect, and probably will be structured in the manner of other CVG corporations such as SIDOR, VENALUM. and ALCASE. While a feasibility study had been made at the initial conception of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project, ", "it considered tropical woods rather than pines as the basic raw material. A probable timetable for Uverito development is: late 1978-79 for new feasibility studies; 1979-81 for decisions on equity participation; 1981-82 for start of construction; and 1984 for start-up of production.", "CONARE", "Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CONARE) was created in August 1975, with the mandate to take responsibility for Venezuela's forestry industry (excluding Uverito). Under Federal decree No. 1341 of December 16, 1975, CONARE was authorized to incorporate the private sector into Venezuela's forestry programs. While CONARE has several small experimental forests throughout the country, its major area of development is in South Anzoategui and Monagas States, on land owned by the National Agrarian Institute. Here CONARE has about 100,000 hectares which it plans to divide into seven huge blocks and to develop, in conjunction with its Venezuelan and foreign partners, a large Caribbean pine and eucalyptus plantation.", "Companies established by CONARE include: (1) Corporacion Forestal Guayamure, with an area of about 10,000 hectares of Caribbean pine; (2) Forestor, with an area of 75,000 hectares which will be planted to eucalyptus to support a 300,000 ton-year pulp mill; and (3) Corporacion Forestal Sipao S.A., which will plant 18,000 hectares of short-fibered eucalyptus.", "Other Projects", "Corporation Venezolana de Fomento is doing a feasibility study for a bagasse mill at Rio Turbio. Industry", "\nsources are skeptical of this project's success, in part due to water shortages in the area. A ", "project ", "to construct a short fiber mill in Central Portuguesa is also being considered. While no construction has begun, several firms have placed orders for its production.", "Equipment", "With harvesting periods due around 1984, and with initial experimental thinnings already started, the demand for forestry equipment should begin to increase. The manager of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "has already visited the United States to study equipment. The proximity of the United States, which facilitates maintenance, is an important competitive factor.", "In response to the upcoming increases in supply of raw materials there appears to be a new interest in investment in paper machines; several local firms are considering purchases of new machines in the near future. However, industry members are awaiting changes in Government price control policy before making large investments.", "Forestry studies have indicated the need for improved planting methods. Consequently, there should be new purchases of equipment to plant and maintain forests. A Georgia ", "company ", "has already sold quite a few of its semiautomatic transplanters to CONARE, Uverito, and Manpa paper ", "company. ", "Centralized Management", "There has been considerable discussion concerning the placing of Venezuela's forest and pulp industry under one government coordinating agency. Since most of the forestry projects are located in the same area (southern Anzoategui, Monagas, and Uverito) coordination between the entities developing these areas will be required for long-term investments such as pulp Mills. Plans call for a ministerial level commission to coordinate forestry development between Uverito, CONARE, and the private sector. It is reported that the Government is considering consolidating the industry under CONARE'S manageIn ent.", "RECENT DEVELOPMENTS", "1. Newsprint Mill Planned in Australia", "Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd. (ANM) has announced a go-ahead for construction of a A$155 million newsprint mill at Albury, in New South Wales. The New South Wales Government had encouraged the construction of the mill with various incentives, including housing, payroll tax rebates, machinery subsidies, employee training subsidies, and financial assistance in locating key perSonnel.", "The mill will eventually have the capacity to produce 180,000 tons of newsprint a year, raising ANM'S total annual capacity to more than 380,000 tons. More than 90 percent of the raw material furnished would be thermomechanical pulp produced at the mill; the remainder will be imported in the form of bleached sulfate pulp. About 450,000 cubic meters-year of radiata pine is available from about 53,000 hectares of State-owned forest in the area around Albury. ANM presently operates a newsprint mill in Tasmania, and the combined production from both Mills would satisfy about 70 percent of Australia's annual newsprint consumption. This will reduce the country's dependence on imported newsprint\u2014 about 200,000 tons annually, mainly from New ", "Zealand ", "and Canada\u2014and will save about A$70 million in foreign exchange.", "The planning and design of the mill is well under way, and the selection of equipment has reached an advanced", "stage. The ", "project, ", "which is due for completion in 1981, has been welcomed by state and local governments of New South Wales, although there have been some protests from a wide range of community groups, following environmental and economic impact studies on the proposed mill. The ", "project ", "will provide employment for about 800 people during the construction phase, and 650 people when in actual operation. It has been reported that about A-100 million will be borrowed from domestic sources for the ", "project ", "by ANM, with additional capital sought overseas.", "The decision by ANM to construct the new mill at Albury could put the ", "company ", "in direct competition with one of its major shareholders, New Zealand's Tasman Pulp and Paper Co.

Raja Garuda Mas is located at Besitong in North Sumatra province near the border with Aceh. Established in 1974, the firm began operations with only a plywood mill but, in the intervening years, has added two sawmill units and a plant which produces wood-cement panels for prefabricated houses.", "In addition to plywood for construction purposes, the facility also turns out decorative veneer for furniture. Most of the equipment in the plywood plant is of Japanese manufacture though there were two large peelers from a U.S. manufacturer, Production Machinery Inc. of Portland, Oregon. Capacity of the plywood operation is 12,000-15,000 sheets (measuring four feet by eight feet, with a thickness of four millimeters) per day. The plant operates 24 hours per day with the exception of 2 days each month when shut down for maintenance.", "Garuda Mas' sawmill units were set up in 1977 to", "19", "comply with an Indonesian Government regulation compelling holders of timber concessions to process logs locally. As at the plywood facility, most of the equipment was imported from Japan.", "Also in 1977, the ", "company ", "began to manufacture wood-cement panels using as raw material the waste from its plywood and sawmill operations. Wood waste is chipped in a hammer mill, and is washed and mixed with cement to produce panels measuring one meter by twenty centimeters, with a thickness of five centimeters. These panels are used principally in the construction of low-cost, prefabricated houses. At present Garuda Mas produces about 3,000 panels per day.", "Garuda Mas obtains its timber from large concessions controlled by the firm in Aceh province, near the town of Idi. Logs are floated down the Besitong River to the plant site on the river bank. The river also serves as the company's inlet for imported raw materials, which are brought in by barge, mainly from Singapore. Most of the finished products are trucked to Medan's port, Belawan, for shipment to Java or abroad.", "P.T.

Much of the plant's equipment, which appears quite modern, is from Taiwan, though there is some from Japan and West Germany as well. Raw material, in the form of boxed pulp, is imported from the Scandinavian countries, Canada and the United States.

Butts", "Pulpwood", "Deliveries of domestically produced pulpwood to U.S. pulp Mills during January\u2013June 1978 substantially accelerated over the relatively flat first quarter, which was roughly equal to the first quarter of 1977. This year's 6 month deliveries of domestic wood were 660,000 cords over 1977 deliveries, with nearly all of the increase occurring during April\u2013June (table S-2). It appears that the severe winter of 1977-78 (as in 1976-77) slowed logging and hauling activities, but that lost timber production was made up after spring arrived. Softwoods were 75 percent of total domestic wood deliveries while hardwoods provided 25 percent. Pulpwood imports during the first half-year of this year accelerated significantly over 1977 figures, with the nearly half-million cords being 28 percent over yearearlier figures. Thus, total mill pulpwood receipts of 38.6 million cords (domestic and imported) for the JanuaryJune period are 800,000 cords or 2 percent over total receipts for the 1977 period. This figure compares with 36.9 million cords in 1976, up 1.7 million cords or close to 5 percent. As stated, in spite of reported slowdowns of logging activites due to severe winter and wet spring conditions in some areas, pulpwood deliveries to the Mills held up and increased slightly over 1977 figures. The climatic impact on wood supply could well have been softened by increased receipts of chips and sawdust. A check of American Pulpwood Association monthly reports on pulpwood receipts at the Mills shows that mill deliveries of wood residuals\u2014chips and sawdust\u2014during JanuaryJune 1978 increased nearly 18 percent over 1977 while the roundwood form of pulpwood deliveries increased only one-half of one percent. These residuals, or waste chiefly from lumber and plywood mill operations and other timber converting plants, supplied 44 percent of pulpwood deliveries during the 1978 period, up from 40 percent during the comparable months of 1977. Availability of such residues for pulping is directly related to log conversion in the lumber and plywood sec", "tors; which, in turn, is related to the level of housing starts and general construction activity. A high level of activity in solid wood product demand has led to availability of substantial supplies of residual chips and sawdust at the converting Mills. Such waste residuals as pulpwood also supply a generally strong export market. However, chip (pulpwood) exports (table S-14), primarily to Japan, shows only a 27,000-cord increase. Thus the indications are that increased pulpwood requirements at the domestic pulp Mills in 1978 have been met by a combination of increased receipts of pulpwood, mainly wood residuals, and a drawdown of woodyard inventories. Mill pulpwood inventories at the end of June totaled 5.0 million cords, down 360,000 cords from March 31 levels and 1.2 million cords during the first 6 months, or 19 percent below the level of December 31, 1977. The volume of pulpwood consumed in pulp manufacture has shown growth closely correlated to the combination of increased mill pulpwood receipts and a substantial drawdown of mill wood inventories. Total U.S. consumption of pulpwood during January\u2013June 1978, at 39.8 million cords, is up 1.4 million cords or 3.7 percent from the comparable 1977 period. Leading regions in pulpwood consumption continue to be the South Central and South Atlantic, where Mills in each region utilized close to 12.7 million cords during the first 6 months of 1978, representing 64 percent of total U.S. pulpwood consumed. The 8.2 million cords consumed in western Mills (21 percent of the U.S. total) puts the region in third place; with the Northeast Mills (3.6 million cords), and the North Central Mills (2.7 million cords) a distant fourth and fifth. On a percentage basis, the greatest increase in pulpwood use occurred in the Northeast region's Mills\u2014up 17 percent. The regional pulpwood consumption data suggest a related increase in pulp production and capacity utilization in those States. However, regional pulp production data are not available. The first 6-months of data suggest that total pulpwood receipts at the Mills could approach 76.3 million cords by the end of 1978, up 3.8 percent from 73.5 million cords in", "(3)", "1977, and 4.8 percent over the 72.8 million cords delivered in 1976. Annual pulpwood consumption will grow at a slightly higher rate. The 6-month data suggest 1978 pulpwood annual consumption will be close to 79.7 million cords, 4.7 million cords or 6 percent over 1977 figures, and 6.5 million cords and 9 percent over 1976. Pulpwood consumption for the first half of 1978, adjusted to an annual rate, indicates that pulpwood production and deliveries must increase in the second half by about 2 million cords over the January\u2013June figures to satisfy mill requirements without the further drawing down of woodyard inventory levels. Currently, woodyard inventories are at their lowest point in 10 years. Except in the Northeast, regional pulpwood inventories at the Mills are down 300,000 to 400,000 cords from last year's levels in each region. With increasing emphasis on recovery of wastepaper as a source of paper and boardmaking fibers, the pressure to increase pulpwood supplies May soften during the last half of 1978.", "Wastepaper and Other Raw Materials", "The consumption of non-wood fibers in papermaking, such as straw, rags, and bagasse (table S-2) increased by 14,000 tons in the first half of 1978 over 1977. However, on an annual basis, consumption of nonwood fibers should be about 200,000 tons below 1976 levels. Nonwood fibers constitute a minor portion of the \u201cother\u201d fibrous materials utilized in pulp production.", "Wastepaper is the major secondary fiber raw materials source. Receipts of wastepaper at Mills during the first half of 1978 totaled 6.1 million tons and constituted 95 percent of the non-wood fibrous materials utilized. The January\u2013June data suggest that a total of about 12 million tons of all grades of wastepaper will be delivered to the Mills in 1978; compared with a reported 10.4 million tons received in 1977 and 12.2 million tons for 1976. Data from the Bureau of the Census for 1977 is preliminary. Figures for 1977 nonwood fibrous materials consumption are estimated to be 1.5 to 2.0 million tons too low, which would give a total of 12.0 to 12.4 million tons delivered.", "The primary data base improvements developing in 1978 are guidelines to industry reporting of wastepaper consumption. The data suggest that the full-year rate of wastepaper receipts will realistically reach 12.2 to 12.5 million tons for 1978. Wastepaper consumption at the paper, paperboard and related products Mills, is slightly more than 6 million tons for the first 6 months and roughly equals receipts. With the improved reporting, the full 1978 consumption of all wastepaper grades in such Mills should exceed the 12.1 million tons estimated for", "1977 by 2 to 3 percent above the 1976 level. The total for 1978 could possibly reach 12.5 million tons. During January-June, wastepaper receipts led consumption by about 60,000 tons. Excess receipts were reflected in 766,000 tons of inventories, up 8 percent over December 1977 figures and just 6,000 tons below the 1976 level. All these data combined indicate a relatively stable total demand for wastepaper as a raw material in the paper and board industry. The leading grades of wastepaper consumed continued to be the bulky grades, with old corrugated at 42 percent of the total, mixed waste at 24 percent, and waste news at 17 percent. Consumption of high grades of wastepaper varied little from year earlier figures because of competition from abundant and cheap virgin market pulp. The wastepaper inventories of 766,000 tons at paper, paperboard, and allied products Mills, increased about 9 percent over December and June 1977 inventories, and returned to the generally higher level reached in 1974. This increased inventory level could well be associated with the growing interest in and expansion or use of old corrugated in linerboard Mills as a portion of the fiber used in unbleached liner manufacture. The influence of this waste grade in the inventory trend is also seen in the substantial increase in consumption of old corrugated, which, over the 1978 six-month period, increased 360,000 tons, or 17 percent, over the like period in 1977. Exports of old corrugated during the period, at 255,000 tons, were nearly 30,000 tons behind 1977 six-month figures. A net gain of close to 330,000 tons in sales of old corrugated by the wastepaper industry appears to have been achieved. This net gain in movement of old corrugated does not make up, however, for the substantial export loss of 64,000 tons of high grade, higher value pulp substitutes, compared with 1977 exports. With European economies improving, European demand for U.S. papermaking fiber, including the high grade wastepapers, is expected to increase. Countries such as England, Sweden, Holland, Italy and West Germany, in their attempts to increase recovery and recycling of domestic wastepaper and reduce reliance upon wastepaper imports, will challenge U.S. wastepaper. Both the domestic and world fiber markets pose a very real challenge to the wastepaper industry to furnish quality packs in required volume at prices competitive with virgin pulp and indigenous wastepaper stocks. There is no indication that the cellulosic insulation industry, utilizing substantial volumes of old news, has recovered from the debacle of last winter. Trade journals, however, are reporting the insulators\u2019 demand for wastepaper will strengthen with the coming of cool weather, and old newspaper prices will improve.", "Get this book in print", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "increase over the same period last year. Most of the increase was in the Appalachian hardwood region which produced 20 percent of the hardwood lumber in the first half of 1978. Actual production in the Appalachian region was 628 million board feet, up 14 percent over last year. In the Southern hardwood region, hardwood lumber production for the same period was 1,457 million board feet, only slightly higher (1 percent) than last year. The remaining hardwood producing regions, the majority in the North Central States, produced 1,075 million board feet through June 1978, a 5 percent increase over the same period last year.", "Imports of hardwood lumber remained practically at the same level as the first 6 months of last year at 159 million board feet, with Canada supplying 31 percent, Brazil 24 percent, Malaysia 15 percent, and the Philippines 9 percent. Exports of hardwood lumber ran slightly ahead of imports at 163 million board feet. Canada purchased 50 percent of U.S. hardwood lumber exports, followed by France 17 percent, West Germany 13 percent, and the Netherlands 8 percent. Therefore, with production at 3,160 million board feet and exports and imports at the above levels, hardwood lumber imports account for 5 percent of domestic hardwood lumber apparent consumption.", "Lighter-colored hardwoods, such as oak, are replacing the once dominant darkwoods, such as walnut, in furniture manufacturing. Teakwood is especially expensive as a result of the self-imposed embargo on the export of unprocessed wood products from Thailand. Thailand is the major U.S. source of high quality teak, which is still unrivaled in boat deck construction. U.S. importers and boat builders are seeking to persuade the Thai's to reverse their embargo decision.", "Hardwood Plywood", "Hardwood plywood imports for the first half of 1978 were 2,440 million square feet (MMSF-surface measure), 12 percent above the similar period last year. The Republic of Korea was the major supplier at 1,326 MMSF or 53 percent. Taiwan was the next largest supplier at 31 percent, followed by Japan 7 percent, and the Philippines 5 percent. Hardwood plywood with a Philippine mahogany (sometimes called lauan) face accounted for 45 percent of hardwood plywood imports.", "Although monthly production figures for hardwood plywood are not available, yearly figures are published by the Bureau of the Census. In 1977, hardwood plywood production was 1,478 MMSF, an 8 percent increase over 1976. Manufacturers' shipments of hardwood plywood were 1,339 MMSF in 1977, valued at $4.68 million. Imports of hardwood plywood for domestic consumption", "were 4,186 MMSF valued at $429 million in 1977. Therefore, imports as a percent of domestic consumption were 76.5 percent (quantity basis) in 1977. U.S. exports of hardwood plywood were minimal at 4.1 percent of manufacturers' shipments. Manufacturers' shipments of hardwood plywood shipped in the unfinished state (to prefinishers) were 859 MMSF or 64 percent of manufacturers' shipments. The remaining 36 percent was shipped as prefinished; i.e., hardwood plywood manufactured and prefinished in the same establishment. Prefinished hardwood plywood made from purchased plywood was 2,190 MMSF. Purchases were made from domestic and foreign manufacturers. The South Atlantic States produced 44 percent of the quantity of production of veneer core (type II, moisture resistant) hardwood playwood in 1977. Type II, moistureresistant hardwood plywood represented 75 percent of hardwood plywood production in 1977. The Pacific States accounted for 34 percent of production, the East and North Central States 9 percent, the New England and Middle Atlantic States 6 percent. Although the Pacific States supplied 34 percent of production, only 51 percent of net volume of hardwood sawtimber on commercial timberland in the United States is located on the West Coast. Therefore, most of the hardwood plywood produced on the West Coast is dependent on hardwood veneer imports. Hardwood veneer imports in 1977 were 1,703 MMSF, an increase of 7 percent over 1976. In the first 6 months of 1978, imports were 794 MMSF, a decrease of 5 percent over the same period in 1977. Canada was the leading supplier of hardwood veneer to the United States\u2014mostly birch at 401 MMSF or 51 percent of U.S. imports from January\u2013June 1978. The Philippines was the second largest supplier of hardwood veneers to the United States at 188 MMSF or a 24 percent import share; Brazil supplied 85 MMSF or 11 percent; Peru 22 MMSF or 3 percent; and Malaysia, Indonesia, and Taiwan each supplied 1 percent. The Republic of Korea and Taiwan, the two largest suppliers of hardwood plywood to the United States, depend on Southeast Asian countries for their raw material supply\u2014hardwood logs. Japan is also a major importer of Southeast Asian hardwood logs. The supply of hardwood logs from the tropical less-developed countries to these producing countries May undergo major changes in the next two decades. Primarily, major forestry and wood product industry projects in these countries are aimed at developing the forest products industry to an extent that timber harvested would be converted to lumber, plywood, or paper products domestically, and then sold for internal consumption or export. Significant progress in industry development will, however, take some time\u2014at least until the end of the century. More importantly, however, is the alarming", "\nrate of deforestation in the developing countries of South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. At a June 1978 conference in Washington, D.C., private and public officials met to discuss the deforestation problem and its social, environmental, and economic implications for these countries and the world. Deforestration was attributed to (1) the expanding population's need to clear", "land for settlement and agriculture and (2) the extensive use of wood for fuel. While land clearing and settlement are considered as economic progress by the general population, such consequences as erosion, endangering delicate ecosystems, climate changes, and decrease of world wood supply are the results.", "SWEDISH PULP AND PAPER INDUSTRY: 1977 ", "REVIEW ", "AND OUTLOOK", "By the American Embassy in Stockholm", "Summary", "The recession in Sweden's key pulp and paper industry, one of the mainstays of the nation's prosperity and economic stability, continued through calender year 1977. Pulp and paper export prices remained very depressed throughout the year and yielded little or no profit to producers. By year's end, several companies found themselves in a precarious financial situation, and some were on the verge of bankruptcy. However, the ini-tial months of 1978 appeared to mark a turning point not only for Sweden's pulp and paper industry but for the West European industry as well. Economic activity in Western Europe seemed, at long last, to be on the upturn, and this was favorably reflected in a growing demand for pulp and paper. Moreover, the pressure from North American producers has eased in the West European market as a result of the rising demand for pulp and paper at home.", "Around mid-1978, optimism was growing in Sweden's pulp and paper industry. The large pulp inventories built up by Mills during 3 lean years to sustain mill employment have finally been brought down to normal operating levels. The backlog of orders for pulp and paper is increasing, mill operations are being stepped up, and export sales prices are being adjusted upward, though still not enough to compensate producers fully for their growing costs.", "Industry Remained Depressed in 1977", "The year 1977 brought little relief to Sweden's hardhit pulp industry. The total volume of export shipments in that year was no larger than in 1976 due mainly to the unsatisfactory rate of economic activity in Western Europe, which normally takes about 90 percent of Sweden's aggregate pulp exports. Other factors adversely affecting Sweden's pulp export trade were the continued high domestic cost inflation; the unstable currency market, particularly the declining U.S. dollar rate; and the keen competition in Sweden's traditional West European pulp market from North American, notably Canadian, producers. To meet the increasing North American competi. tion, the Swedish pulp industry was forced to make several", "downward price adjustments during 1977, and this occurred at a time when cost inflation at home was at an unprecedented level. This, of course, aggravated the already grave problems confronting Swedish pulp producers, bringing many of them to the verge of bandruptcy.", "The market situation in 1977 called for curtailed operations at many Mills. As a result, the industry as a whole used only 68 percent of its existing productive capacity during the year. A Bright spot in an otherwise cloudy picture was that the industry, largely through production cutbacks and intensive selling efforts in nonEuropean markets, was successful in bringing down mill pulp inventories from the costly and unwieldly level of well over 1.5 million metric tons at the end of 1976 to just over a million tons at the end of 1977. This heavy financial burden on Swedish pulp companies, resulting from previous Government-supported pulp inventory buildups to sustain mill employment, was thus well on the way to being eliminated late in 1977, which augured well for mill production during the months ahead. For data on Swedish production and exports of wood pulp by grade, see figures 1 and 2.", "Only 73 Percent of Capacity Used in 1977", "In terms of capacity utilization, Sweden's paper industry did better than the pulp industry during 1977. Production of paper and paperboard in that year totaled 5.1 million metric tons. This represented a gain of 2.3 percent over 1976 but, due to several new additions to plant facilities, production in 1977 amounted to only 73 percent of the industry's rated productive capacity. A relatively slow growth rate in West European paper and board consumption in conjunction with varying exchange rates and depressed prices were factors adversely affecting developments in Sweden's paper industry. Export shipments, however, were maintained at a relatively satisfactory level, but at prices that yielded little or no profit to producers. Moreover, mill inventories of paper and board continued to accumulate during the year and effectively prevented producers from making any upward adjustments in export or home market prices.", "Sweden's exports of paper and board during 1977 totaled 3.7 million tons, compared to 3.4 million tons in 1976. The increase was attributed mainly to larger shipments of kraft liner, fluting paper, and various grades of", "\nprinting paper. A notable feature was that virtually all of the increase in exports attained during 1977 consisted of paper and board destined to countries outside the European Common Market, mainly to customers in Asia and Africa. For data on Swedish production and export of paper and board, see figures 3 and 4.", "Continued Freeze of EC Paper Ceilings", "Under the import tariff dismantling terms of Sweden's free trade agreement with the European Community (EC), tariffs on paper and board, except newsprint, imported from Sweden were lowered from 10 to 8 percent ad valorem effective July 1, 1977. The tariff dismantling schedule calls for a reduction in EC tariffs on most grades of paper and board from 12 percent in 1973 to zero duty by 1984. The next tariff cut to 6 percent is to be January 1, 1979.", "Eight import ceilings are enforced by the EC for specific categories of paper and board supplied by Sweden. Originally, it was the intention of the EC to raise these ceilings by 5 percent annually. Paper and board imports from Sweden in excess of these ceilings are, in most cases, dutiable at a penalty rate, which is the full rate of 12 percent ad valorem that existed before the free trade agreement was concluded. During 1977, Swedish exporters were obliged to pay penalty rates for exceeding four of the eight import ceilings. Early in 1978 it was announced that the EC, reportedly at the request of some member nations (France and Belgium were specifically mentioned in the Swedish press), had decided on a continued freeze of three ceilings during calendar year 1978. This means that the earlier intended 5 percent increase of those ceilings will not be implemented for the third year in succession. It is noted in this connection that the EC, in 1976, had reached a decision to freeze all eight of its ceilings for imports of Swedish paper and board. This move was taken in retaliation against the imposition in the same year of Swedish import restrictions on shoes.", "Outlook Improves for Pulp and Paper Industry", "The market Outlook for Sweden's pulp and paper industry, which early in 1978 was judged with considerable caution, not to say pessimism, is now generally regarded in industry circles to be improving. The industry foresees an improvement in its overall order book position during the months ahead, especially with respect to export orders. Developments since the end of 1977 indicate that the Western European economy is beginning to show signs of recovery, and although the upturn has been slight, it has already had a favorable effect on activity in Sweden's pulp and paper industry. Moreover, the rising demand for pulp", "and paper in North America is reported by Swedish trades to have eased the price pressure from North American producers in the West European market.", "Swedish pulp and paper industry spokesmen recently stated that they have now, for the first time since 1974, been enabled to make upward adjustments in export prices. This, they say is a welcome development not only because the EC Commission has accused Swedish and other Nordic producers, of dumping their chemical pulp in the EC market, but also because the Swedish industry will now be in a position to reduce somewhat the losses suffered in recent years. Swedish producers attribute their low price policy in the Common Market to the need for competing in prices with North American exporters. Growing demand at home is said to be reducing American and Canadian interest in the West European market. This, in conjunction with a continued sharp reduction in previously unwieldy mill pulp inventories, paved the way for some eagerly awaited improvements in Swedish pulp export prices. After having reduced prices to extremely low levels, the Swedish pulp industry was, at long last, in a position to announce upward price adjustments for export shipments during the third quarter of 1978. For major pulp grades, those prices are the following (per ton, cost, insurance, and freight\u2014c.i.f., West European ports): longfiber bleached sulfate\u2014$340; bleached sulfite\u2014 $325; birchwood pulp\u2014$320. Although these prices are from $15 to $20 higher than those previously quoted, they are still not quite adequate to compensate producers for their rising production costs. According to one industry official, a price of about $380 per ton for most major pulp grades would be needed to give producers what they now regard as a reasonable profit margin.", "According to industry sources, Sweden's pulp industry is expected to step up operations substantially during the second half of 1978 now that the previously large mill pulp inventories have been brought down to normal operating levels. As a result, the rate of capacity utilization in calendar 1978 is expected to average about 80 percent, compared to 68 percent in 1977. Total pulp production (chemical, semi-chemical, and mechanical, except defibrated and exploded pulps entering directly into hardboard and insulation board production) is expected to increase to 8.4 million metric tons in 1978 from 7.7 million tons in 1977, a gain of over 9 percent. This production increase will be made possible largely as the result of a recovery of markets in Western Europe previously lost to North American producers, and of a substantial increase in pulp shipments to Asian countries, notably Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. A rather substantial increase in paper and board production is also predicted. According to industry sources, output in 1978 is", "\nexpected to attain an all-time high and exceed that of 1977 by at least 12 percent.", "1978-83 Expansion Plans", "Despite several lean years, Sweden's pulp and paper industry plans to proceed with its expansion and plant improvement program during the coming 5-year period. This was revealed in a recent study conducted by the Swedish Pulp and Paper Association. The industry, however, has decided to go slow with the implementation of this program during 1978 and has cut back on previously earmarked investment in new plant and equipment for the current year. According to the study, the Swedish pulp industry's present annual capacity totals 1 1.5 million metric tons. This figure includes all grades of wood pulp (both captive and market pulps) but excludes defibrated and exploded pulps used directly for the manufacture of hardboard or insulation board. By 1983, total annual capacity is expected to amount to 12.5 million tons. The industry's present capacity of 11.5 million tons is distributed as follows: chemical pulp, 8.2 million tons; and semi-chemical pulp, 0.5 million tons. There will be little change in this capacity during 1979. As for paper, the industry's present plans call for an overall capacity increase of 1.3 million metric tons, to 8.3 million tons, by 1983. This is equivalent to an average annual increase of 3.5 percent. The industry's present capacity is distributed by major grades as follows: kraft papers, 1.4 million metric tons; newsprint, 1.6 million tons; other printing papers, 1.1 million tons; paperboard, 2.2 million tons (half of paperboard capacity consists of kraft liner); other papers, 0.7 million tons. Of the total planned capacity expansion, almost one million tons will be in paper grades, with the emphasis on newsprint. A new newsprint machine using chiefly", "FOREST PRODUCTS ", "REVIEW ", "recycled paper is scheduled to go into production at the end of 1978. In the case of paperboard, capacity additions totaling about 340,000 tons are planned. Most of this increase will be for kraft liner and bleached folding boxboard.", "Acquisition of Additional Corrugated Board Capacity Abroad", "Late in 1977, the Swedish Pulp and Paper Association announced that Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA), a leading Swedish forest industry concern, had acquired 80 percent of the share capital of the French corrugated fiberboard ", "company ", "Sofac-Socapa. Acquisition of the French ", "company, ", "which manufactures some 30,000 tons of corrugated fiberboard packaging material annually, gave SCA corrugated fiberboard manufacturing facilities in France a total capacity of about 125,000 tons yearly.", "In addition, SCA reportedly signed an agreement some months ago with the Anglo-Irish ", "Company ", "Jefferson/Smurfit under which the Swedish concern obtained 49 percent of the capital stock of jefferson/smurfit's corrugated fiberboard business in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. That business comprises eight corrugated fiberboard Mills and three converting plants with an aggregate annual capacity of 160,000 tons. These latest acquisitions brought the total corrugated fiberboard capacity of companies wholly and jointly owned by SCA to approximately 600,000 tons yearly.", "By purchasing an interest in paper-making and paperconverting facilities in foreign countries, SCA hopes to ensure a good and steady outlet for its own pulp and paper production in northern Sweden.

", "VENEZUELA'S MAJOR FORESTRY PROJECTS", "(Excerpted from American Embassy-Caracas Report)", "Summary", "Venezuela has begun a number of large forestry projects to satisfy the fiber requirements of that nation's pulp and paper Mills. Raw material needs are particularly acute with respect to secondary fibers for the paper and board industry, long-fibered pulp for newsprint, and softwood timber for use in the construction industry. The pulp and paper industry is heavily dependent on imports, with 83 percent of all pulp requirements being imported. As these projects reach maturity, opportunities for U.S. businessmen will arise in construction, consulting/engineering, and equipment sales.", "Because of current pulp, short fiber, and timber shortages, Venezuela has embarked on an ambitious planting/development program for Caribbean pine and eucalyptus in the southern Anzoategui and northern Monagas State areas, respectively. The objective is to convert the Sabanas into a gigantic forestry and industry complex capable of supporting several pulp Mills that would not only supply domestic needs but also provide valuable export income. The two major government agencies responsible for these developments are Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) and Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CNR).", "Uverito ", "Project ", "The Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "was begun in 1969 by Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana with the intention of planting 218 million trees on 150,000 hectares by 1985, in order to produce long fiber pulp-mainly for the production of newsprint. Long fiber pulp is currently imported at an annual rate of 80,000 tons. Caribbean pine (Hondurensis), imported from Guatemala and other Central American countries, is the type of tree being planted. To date, about 80 million trees have been planted on 110,000 acres, with an additional 110 million planned for 1984. Plans are being made to harvest trees for pulp production in 1984. Eventually, 4,000 hectares out of every 10,000 will be harvested for pulp, with the remainder being conserved for timber production (maturity: about 10 to 15 years). By 1986, CVG expects to reach the 4,000 hectare level, with an expected yield of 180 cubic meters per hectare. CVG will require forestry equipment and technical assistance for the extraction process.", "In preparation for the harvesting period, CVG has plans to build a pulp mill capable of producing 200,000 tons annually, which should be completed by the 1984 deadline. Decisions on outside equity participation and exact composition have yet to be made, but the mill will be separately managed from the rest of the forestry ", "proj", "ect, and probably will be structured in the manner of other CVG corporations such as SIDOR, VENALUM. and ALCASE. While a feasibility study had been made at the initial conception of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project, ", "it considered tropical woods rather than pines as the basic raw material. A probable timetable for Uverito development is: late 1978-79 for new feasibility studies; 1979-81 for decisions on equity participation; 1981-82 for start of construction; and 1984 for start-up of production.", "CONARE", "Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CONARE) was created in August 1975, with the mandate to take responsibility for Venezuela's forestry industry (excluding Uverito). Under Federal decree No. 1341 of December 16, 1975, CONARE was authorized to incorporate the private sector into Venezuela's forestry programs. While CONARE has several small experimental forests throughout the country, its major area of development is in South Anzoategui and Monagas States, on land owned by the National Agrarian Institute. Here CONARE has about 100,000 hectares which it plans to divide into seven huge blocks and to develop, in conjunction with its Venezuelan and foreign partners, a large Caribbean pine and eucalyptus plantation.", "Companies established by CONARE include: (1) Corporacion Forestal Guayamure, with an area of about 10,000 hectares of Caribbean pine; (2) Forestor, with an area of 75,000 hectares which will be planted to eucalyptus to support a 300,000 ton-year pulp mill; and (3) Corporacion Forestal Sipao S.A., which will plant 18,000 hectares of short-fibered eucalyptus.", "Other Projects", "Corporation Venezolana de Fomento is doing a feasibility study for a bagasse mill at Rio Turbio. Industry", "\nsources are skeptical of this project's success, in part due to water shortages in the area. A ", "project ", "to construct a short fiber mill in Central Portuguesa is also being considered. While no construction has begun, several firms have placed orders for its production.", "Equipment", "With harvesting periods due around 1984, and with initial experimental thinnings already started, the demand for forestry equipment should begin to increase. The manager of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "has already visited the United States to study equipment. The proximity of the United States, which facilitates maintenance, is an important competitive factor.", "In response to the upcoming increases in supply of raw materials there appears to be a new interest in investment in paper machines; several local firms are considering purchases of new machines in the near future. However, industry members are awaiting changes in Government price control policy before making large investments.", "Forestry studies have indicated the need for improved planting methods. Consequently, there should be new purchases of equipment to plant and maintain forests. A Georgia ", "company ", "has already sold quite a few of its semiautomatic transplanters to CONARE, Uverito, and Manpa paper ", "company. ", "Centralized Management", "There has been considerable discussion concerning the placing of Venezuela's forest and pulp industry under one government coordinating agency. Since most of the forestry projects are located in the same area (southern Anzoategui, Monagas, and Uverito) coordination between the entities developing these areas will be required for long-term investments such as pulp Mills. Plans call for a ministerial level commission to coordinate forestry development between Uverito, CONARE, and the private sector. It is reported that the Government is considering consolidating the industry under CONARE'S manageIn ent.", "RECENT DEVELOPMENTS", "1. Newsprint Mill Planned in Australia", "Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd. (ANM) has announced a go-ahead for construction of a A$155 million newsprint mill at Albury, in New South Wales. The New South Wales Government had encouraged the construction of the mill with various incentives, including housing, payroll tax rebates, machinery subsidies, employee training subsidies, and financial assistance in locating key perSonnel.", "The mill will eventually have the capacity to produce 180,000 tons of newsprint a year, raising ANM'S total annual capacity to more than 380,000 tons. More than 90 percent of the raw material furnished would be thermomechanical pulp produced at the mill; the remainder will be imported in the form of bleached sulfate pulp. About 450,000 cubic meters-year of radiata pine is available from about 53,000 hectares of State-owned forest in the area around Albury. ANM presently operates a newsprint mill in Tasmania, and the combined production from both Mills would satisfy about 70 percent of Australia's annual newsprint consumption. This will reduce the country's dependence on imported newsprint\u2014 about 200,000 tons annually, mainly from New ", "Zealand ", "and Canada\u2014and will save about A$70 million in foreign exchange.", "The planning and design of the mill is well under way, and the selection of equipment has reached an advanced", "stage. The ", "project, ", "which is due for completion in 1981, has been welcomed by state and local governments of New South Wales, although there have been some protests from a wide range of community groups, following environmental and economic impact studies on the proposed mill. The ", "project ", "will provide employment for about 800 people during the construction phase, and 650 people when in actual operation. It has been reported that about A-100 million will be borrowed from domestic sources for the ", "project ", "by ANM, with additional capital sought overseas.", "The decision by ANM to construct the new mill at Albury could put the ", "company ", "in direct competition with one of its major shareholders, New Zealand's Tasman Pulp and Paper Co.

Most of the equipment in the plywood plant is of Japanese manufacture though there were two large peelers from a U.S. manufacturer, Production Machinery Inc. of Portland, Oregon. Capacity of the plywood operation is 12,000-15,000 sheets (measuring four feet by eight feet, with a thickness of four millimeters) per day. The plant operates 24 hours per day with the exception of 2 days each month when shut down for maintenance.", "Garuda Mas' sawmill units were set up in 1977 to", "19", "comply with an Indonesian Government regulation compelling holders of timber concessions to process logs locally. As at the plywood facility, most of the equipment was imported from Japan.", "Also in 1977, the ", "company ", "began to manufacture wood-cement panels using as raw material the waste from its plywood and sawmill operations. Wood waste is chipped in a hammer mill, and is washed and mixed with cement to produce panels measuring one meter by twenty centimeters, with a thickness of five centimeters. These panels are used principally in the construction of low-cost, prefabricated houses. At present Garuda Mas produces about 3,000 panels per day.", "Garuda Mas obtains its timber from large concessions controlled by the firm in Aceh province, near the town of Idi. Logs are floated down the Besitong River to the plant site on the river bank. The river also serves as the company's inlet for imported raw materials, which are brought in by barge, mainly from Singapore.

Much of the plant's equipment, which appears quite modern, is from Taiwan, though there is some from Japan and West Germany as well. Raw material, in the form of boxed pulp, is imported from the Scandinavian countries, Canada and the United States.

", "COMMODITY TRENDS: PULP, PAPER, AND BOARD PRODUCTS", "January-June 1977-78", "By Howard A. Post and Donald W. Butts", "Pulpwood", "Deliveries of domestically produced pulpwood to U.S. pulp Mills during January\u2013June 1978 substantially accelerated over the relatively flat first quarter, which was roughly equal to the first quarter of 1977. This year's 6 month deliveries of domestic wood were 660,000 cords over 1977 deliveries, with nearly all of the increase occurring during April\u2013June (table S-2). It appears that the severe winter of 1977-78 (as in 1976-77) slowed logging and hauling activities, but that lost timber production was made up after spring arrived. Softwoods were 75 percent of total domestic wood deliveries while hardwoods provided 25 percent. Pulpwood imports during the first half-year of this year accelerated significantly over 1977 figures, with the nearly half-million cords being 28 percent over yearearlier figures. Thus, total mill pulpwood receipts of 38.6 million cords (domestic and imported) for the JanuaryJune period are 800,000 cords or 2 percent over total receipts for the 1977 period. This figure compares with 36.9 million cords in 1976, up 1.7 million cords or close to 5 percent. As stated, in spite of reported slowdowns of logging activites due to severe winter and wet spring conditions in some areas, pulpwood deliveries to the Mills held up and increased slightly over 1977 figures. The climatic impact on wood supply could well have been softened by increased receipts of chips and sawdust. A check of American Pulpwood Association monthly reports on pulpwood receipts at the Mills shows that mill deliveries of wood residuals\u2014chips and sawdust\u2014during JanuaryJune 1978 increased nearly 18 percent over 1977 while the roundwood form of pulpwood deliveries increased only one-half of one percent. These residuals, or waste chiefly from lumber and plywood mill operations and other timber converting plants, supplied 44 percent of pulpwood deliveries during the 1978 period, up from 40 percent during the comparable months of 1977. Availability of such residues for pulping is directly related to log conversion in the lumber and plywood sec", "tors; which, in turn, is related to the level of housing starts and general construction activity. A high level of activity in solid wood product demand has led to availability of substantial supplies of residual chips and sawdust at the converting Mills. Such waste residuals as pulpwood also supply a generally strong export market. However, chip (pulpwood) exports (table S-14), primarily to Japan, shows only a 27,000-cord increase. Thus the indications are that increased pulpwood requirements at the domestic pulp Mills in 1978 have been met by a combination of increased receipts of pulpwood, mainly wood residuals, and a drawdown of woodyard inventories. Mill pulpwood inventories at the end of June totaled 5.0 million cords, down 360,000 cords from March 31 levels and 1.2 million cords during the first 6 months, or 19 percent below the level of December 31, 1977. The volume of pulpwood consumed in pulp manufacture has shown growth closely correlated to the combination of increased mill pulpwood receipts and a substantial drawdown of mill wood inventories. Total U.S. consumption of pulpwood during January\u2013June 1978, at 39.8 million cords, is up 1.4 million cords or 3.7 percent from the comparable 1977 period. Leading regions in pulpwood consumption continue to be the South Central and South Atlantic, where Mills in each region utilized close to 12.7 million cords during the first 6 months of 1978, representing 64 percent of total U.S. pulpwood consumed. The 8.2 million cords consumed in western Mills (21 percent of the U.S. total) puts the region in third place; with the Northeast Mills (3.6 million cords), and the North Central Mills (2.7 million cords) a distant fourth and fifth. On a percentage basis, the greatest increase in pulpwood use occurred in the Northeast region's Mills\u2014up 17 percent. The regional pulpwood consumption data suggest a related increase in pulp production and capacity utilization in those States. However, regional pulp production data are not available. The first 6-months of data suggest that total pulpwood receipts at the Mills could approach 76.3 million cords by the end of 1978, up 3.8 percent from 73.5 million cords in", "(3)", "1977, and 4.8 percent over the 72.8 million cords delivered in 1976. Annual pulpwood consumption will grow at a slightly higher rate. The 6-month data suggest 1978 pulpwood annual consumption will be close to 79.7 million cords, 4.7 million cords or 6 percent over 1977 figures, and 6.5 million cords and 9 percent over 1976. Pulpwood consumption for the first half of 1978, adjusted to an annual rate, indicates that pulpwood production and deliveries must increase in the second half by about 2 million cords over the January\u2013June figures to satisfy mill requirements without the further drawing down of woodyard inventory levels. Currently, woodyard inventories are at their lowest point in 10 years. Except in the Northeast, regional pulpwood inventories at the Mills are down 300,000 to 400,000 cords from last year's levels in each region. With increasing emphasis on recovery of wastepaper as a source of paper and boardmaking fibers, the pressure to increase pulpwood supplies May soften during the last half of 1978.", "Wastepaper and Other Raw Materials", "The consumption of non-wood fibers in papermaking, such as straw, rags, and bagasse (table S-2) increased by 14,000 tons in the first half of 1978 over 1977. However, on an annual basis, consumption of nonwood fibers should be about 200,000 tons below 1976 levels. Nonwood fibers constitute a minor portion of the \u201cother\u201d fibrous materials utilized in pulp production.", "Wastepaper is the major secondary fiber raw materials source. Receipts of wastepaper at Mills during the first half of 1978 totaled 6.1 million tons and constituted 95 percent of the non-wood fibrous materials utilized. The January\u2013June data suggest that a total of about 12 million tons of all grades of wastepaper will be delivered to the Mills in 1978; compared with a reported 10.4 million tons received in 1977 and 12.2 million tons for 1976. Data from the Bureau of the Census for 1977 is preliminary. Figures for 1977 nonwood fibrous materials consumption are estimated to be 1.5 to 2.0 million tons too low, which would give a total of 12.0 to 12.4 million tons delivered.", "The primary data base improvements developing in 1978 are guidelines to industry reporting of wastepaper consumption. The data suggest that the full-year rate of wastepaper receipts will realistically reach 12.2 to 12.5 million tons for 1978. Wastepaper consumption at the paper, paperboard and related products Mills, is slightly more than 6 million tons for the first 6 months and roughly equals receipts. With the improved reporting, the full 1978 consumption of all wastepaper grades in such Mills should exceed the 12.1 million tons estimated for", "1977 by 2 to 3 percent above the 1976 level. The total for 1978 could possibly reach 12.5 million tons. During January-June, wastepaper receipts led consumption by about 60,000 tons. Excess receipts were reflected in 766,000 tons of inventories, up 8 percent over December 1977 figures and just 6,000 tons below the 1976 level. All these data combined indicate a relatively stable total demand for wastepaper as a raw material in the paper and board industry. The leading grades of wastepaper consumed continued to be the bulky grades, with old corrugated at 42 percent of the total, mixed waste at 24 percent, and waste news at 17 percent. Consumption of high grades of wastepaper varied little from year earlier figures because of competition from abundant and cheap virgin market pulp. The wastepaper inventories of 766,000 tons at paper, paperboard, and allied products Mills, increased about 9 percent over December and June 1977 inventories, and returned to the generally higher level reached in 1974. This increased inventory level could well be associated with the growing interest in and expansion or use of old corrugated in linerboard Mills as a portion of the fiber used in unbleached liner manufacture. The influence of this waste grade in the inventory trend is also seen in the substantial increase in consumption of old corrugated, which, over the 1978 six-month period, increased 360,000 tons, or 17 percent, over the like period in 1977. Exports of old corrugated during the period, at 255,000 tons, were nearly 30,000 tons behind 1977 six-month figures. A net gain of close to 330,000 tons in sales of old corrugated by the wastepaper industry appears to have been achieved. This net gain in movement of old corrugated does not make up, however, for the substantial export loss of 64,000 tons of high grade, higher value pulp substitutes, compared with 1977 exports. With European economies improving, European demand for U.S. papermaking fiber, including the high grade wastepapers, is expected to increase. Countries such as England, Sweden, Holland, Italy and West Germany, in their attempts to increase recovery and recycling of domestic wastepaper and reduce reliance upon wastepaper imports, will challenge U.S. wastepaper. Both the domestic and world fiber markets pose a very real challenge to the wastepaper industry to furnish quality packs in required volume at prices competitive with virgin pulp and indigenous wastepaper stocks. There is no indication that the cellulosic insulation industry, utilizing substantial volumes of old news, has recovered from the debacle of last winter. Trade journals, however, are reporting the insulators\u2019 demand for wastepaper will strengthen with the coming of cool weather, and old newspaper prices will improve.", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "About Google Books", "\n\u2022 ", "Overview", "\n\u2022 ", "Blog", "\n\u2022 ", "User Stories", "\n\u2022 ", "General Help", "\n", "Partner Program", "\n\u2022 ", "For Publishers & Authors", "\n\u2022 ", "Join Now", "\n\u2022 ", "Partner Help", "Library Project", "\n\u2022 ", "Overview", "\n\u2022 ", "Library Partners", "\n\u2022 ", "Librarian Help", "Perspectives", "\n            \u2022 ", "What's the Issue?", "\n            \u2022 ", "Facts & Fiction", "\n            \u2022 ", "Legal Analysis", "\n", " ", "October 13, 2011 | ", "View archived version", "The main ", "Google Privacy Policy", " describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's products and services, including Google Play.

These barges, which at present bring imported raw materials for the plant, will, after the expansion, be used to ship finished products to Java. Shipments to Medan will continue to go by truck. Investment in the plant to date is calculated at U.S. $3 million. With the expansion of facilities contemplated, that investment will almost double. In addition to the domestic market, Garuda Mas sells significant quantities overseas. Sawtimber is exported to the United States, the Netherlands and Singapore, while railroad crossties are sold to Belgium. Limited quantities of plywood have been sent to the United Kingdom, where it passes rugged British quality standards. The major market for plywood, however, is Indonesia itself, particularly Java. Domestic plywood prices are often as much as 50 percent above prevailing world market levels. Demand is strong and shows no signs of slackening. To service its clients on Java, Garuda Mas maintains a sales office in Jakarta. It has also recently appointed a firm in Surabaya to handle distribution in Eastern Indonesia. Garuda Mas' Medan office will soon move to a new five-story structure in the heart of the city. The firm, which employs 1,900 persons, is entirely under the control of five brothers of Chinese extraction who reside in Medan. Source: American Embassy Indonesia report dated August 1978.", "4. Papua New Guinea: Timber Industry Expansion Underway", "Papua New Guinea has the potential of being one of", "the giants of the southeast Asian timber industries. It is second only to Indonesia in total forest area and a close third (after Malaysia) in readily harvestable acreage. Permits have been issued to harvest up to 1 million hectares", "of forest area, and an additional 1.2 million hectares of", "timber rights are available for leasing by developers. Another 8 million hectares is capable of being logged but timber rights would have to be negotiated with local owners. Papua New Guinea (PNG) has a total wood processing industry of 130 factories including 90 sawmills, one plywood mill, three veneer Mills and one woodchip mill. The industry employs 4,000 people, pays about $7 million per year in wages, and has a total investment of $42 million in land, buildings and plants. The industry currently earns about US $3 million in exports, or about 4 percent of total National export earn", "ings. Markets for these products are in Japan and Australia while Korea, Taiwan, and the Netherlands are beginning to buy some timber products. The industry also provides an estimated 60,000 cubic meters of sawn timber and 3,600 cubic meters of plywood for local consumption. The value of the locally consumed timber is US $24 million. The PNG Forestry Industry grew rapidly until about 1973-74 when world prices Fell. In 1974-75 two very large sawmills started operation; but despite this, total production Fell dramatically in 1974 and 1975. Production picked up in 1976 but Fell again in 1977.", "Industry Problems", "The stagnation of the timber industry May be attributed to lower international timber prices, the high cost of production in PNG, and strict government regulations. Papua New Guinea forests contain many different types of hardwoods\u2014in some cases as many as 100 different varieties in a single square mile. Core rot is prevalent. Minimum wage laws and low worker education levels have combined to make PNG a high Labor cost country. As a result of these conditions sawmilling a cubic yard of timber costs $85 as compared to $25 in the United States. Since PNG Government regulations have required a quick transition from export of logs to export of sawn timber, it is easy to comprehend why the timber industry has not prospered.", "Future Prospects", "The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Primary Industry, Julius Chan, has announced upcoming changes in Papua New Guinea's regulations. The changes will encourage greater log exports and will require less construction of social infrastructure on the part of new investors. Some tax breaks will be given to those companies already involved in sawmilling. Though roughly 6 dozen sawmills have closed down in the past 3 years, several are now in various stages of being re-opened under new management. In addition, serious negotiations are under way for major foreign investment in the timber industry. The most immediate is the plan of Hyundai, the Korean firm, to build a multi-million dollar woodchip mill in New Britain. Other projects under serious negotiation include a $2 million logging operation in Manus, a $2.5 million logging operation in the eastern highlands, and a $5-10 million forestry development ", "project ", "in Vanimo near the Irian Jaya border. The Department of Primary Industry is estimating that the new regulations will allow for a tripling of log exports over the next 3 years. This expansion will come partially through greater utilization of existing", "\ncapacity and partially out of additions of new capacity.", "Change in Industry Structure", "If the new regulations take effect as expected, there should be a great increase in the amount of logging. Many companies have found themselves in a position where they could sell logs but not sawn timber. The Government requirement to keep a fixed ratio between the two limited the company's log exports.", "In the meantime, many sawmills are turning inward to local markets. At present most furniture and wood products are still imported despite the great deal of surplus wood left over from sawmilling operations. Local firms are now beginning to build furniture, boxes, furniture parts, etc., and this industry is expected to grow in the next few years. The Government of Papua New Guinea has recently let a tender for a consulting contract to help develop a plan for such an industry in the Central province.", "Source: American Embassy Papua New Guinea report dated August 1978.", "5.

Forest industry leaders stated that the best opportunity to increase wood product supply to meet housing and other demands is by making more timber available from the National Forest lands, which hold more than 50 percent of the Nation's inventory of softwood sawtimber. The industry suggested that immediate and near-term needs for expanded production of wood products must be met from the area where timber resources are located and where productionn capacity is underused, which is in the West. It was also suggested that the Government provide appropriate incentives to stimulate investments which would expand production capacity and improve productivity through further technological developments to increase yields from raw materials.

", "VENEZUELA'S MAJOR FORESTRY PROJECTS", "(Excerpted from American Embassy-Caracas Report)", "Summary", "Venezuela has begun a number of large forestry projects to satisfy the fiber requirements of that nation's pulp and paper Mills. Raw material needs are particularly acute with respect to secondary fibers for the paper and board industry, long-fibered pulp for newsprint, and softwood timber for use in the construction industry. The pulp and paper industry is heavily dependent on imports, with 83 percent of all pulp requirements being imported. As these projects reach maturity, opportunities for U.S. businessmen will arise in construction, consulting/engineering, and equipment sales.", "Because of current pulp, short fiber, and timber shortages, Venezuela has embarked on an ambitious planting/development program for Caribbean pine and eucalyptus in the southern Anzoategui and northern Monagas State areas, respectively. The objective is to convert the Sabanas into a gigantic forestry and industry complex capable of supporting several pulp Mills that would not only supply domestic needs but also provide valuable export income. The two major government agencies responsible for these developments are Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) and Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CNR).", "Uverito ", "Project ", "The Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "was begun in 1969 by Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana with the intention of planting 218 million trees on 150,000 hectares by 1985, in order to produce long fiber pulp-mainly for the production of newsprint. Long fiber pulp is currently imported at an annual rate of 80,000 tons. Caribbean pine (Hondurensis), imported from Guatemala and other Central American countries, is the type of tree being planted. To date, about 80 million trees have been planted on 110,000 acres, with an additional 110 million planned for 1984. Plans are being made to harvest trees for pulp production in 1984. Eventually, 4,000 hectares out of every 10,000 will be harvested for pulp, with the remainder being conserved for timber production (maturity: about 10 to 15 years). By 1986, CVG expects to reach the 4,000 hectare level, with an expected yield of 180 cubic meters per hectare. CVG will require forestry equipment and technical assistance for the extraction process.", "In preparation for the harvesting period, CVG has plans to build a pulp mill capable of producing 200,000 tons annually, which should be completed by the 1984 deadline. Decisions on outside equity participation and exact composition have yet to be made, but the mill will be separately managed from the rest of the forestry ", "proj", "ect, and probably will be structured in the manner of other CVG corporations such as SIDOR, VENALUM. and ALCASE. While a feasibility study had been made at the initial conception of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project, ", "it considered tropical woods rather than pines as the basic raw material. A probable timetable for Uverito development is: late 1978-79 for new feasibility studies; 1979-81 for decisions on equity participation; 1981-82 for start of construction; and 1984 for start-up of production.", "CONARE", "Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CONARE) was created in August 1975, with the mandate to take responsibility for Venezuela's forestry industry (excluding Uverito). Under Federal decree No. 1341 of December 16, 1975, CONARE was authorized to incorporate the private sector into Venezuela's forestry programs. While CONARE has several small experimental forests throughout the country, its major area of development is in South Anzoategui and Monagas States, on land owned by the National Agrarian Institute. Here CONARE has about 100,000 hectares which it plans to divide into seven huge blocks and to develop, in conjunction with its Venezuelan and foreign partners, a large Caribbean pine and eucalyptus plantation.", "Companies established by CONARE include: (1) Corporacion Forestal Guayamure, with an area of about 10,000 hectares of Caribbean pine; (2) Forestor, with an area of 75,000 hectares which will be planted to eucalyptus to support a 300,000 ton-year pulp mill; and (3) Corporacion Forestal Sipao S.A., which will plant 18,000 hectares of short-fibered eucalyptus.", "Other Projects", "Corporation Venezolana de Fomento is doing a feasibility study for a bagasse mill at Rio Turbio. Industry", "\nsources are skeptical of this project's success, in part due to water shortages in the area. A ", "project ", "to construct a short fiber mill in Central Portuguesa is also being considered. While no construction has begun, several firms have placed orders for its production.", "Equipment", "With harvesting periods due around 1984, and with initial experimental thinnings already started, the demand for forestry equipment should begin to increase. The manager of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "has already visited the United States to study equipment. The proximity of the United States, which facilitates maintenance, is an important competitive factor.", "In response to the upcoming increases in supply of raw materials there appears to be a new interest in investment in paper machines; several local firms are considering purchases of new machines in the near future. However, industry members are awaiting changes in Government price control policy before making large investments.", "Forestry studies have indicated the need for improved planting methods. Consequently, there should be new purchases of equipment to plant and maintain forests. A Georgia ", "company ", "has already sold quite a few of its semiautomatic transplanters to CONARE, Uverito, and Manpa paper ", "company. ", "Centralized Management", "There has been considerable discussion concerning the placing of Venezuela's forest and pulp industry under one government coordinating agency. Since most of the forestry projects are located in the same area (southern Anzoategui, Monagas, and Uverito) coordination between the entities developing these areas will be required for long-term investments such as pulp Mills. Plans call for a ministerial level commission to coordinate forestry development between Uverito, CONARE, and the private sector. It is reported that the Government is considering consolidating the industry under CONARE'S manageIn ent.", "RECENT DEVELOPMENTS", "1. Newsprint Mill Planned in Australia", "Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd. (ANM) has announced a go-ahead for construction of a A$155 million newsprint mill at Albury, in New South Wales. The New South Wales Government had encouraged the construction of the mill with various incentives, including housing, payroll tax rebates, machinery subsidies, employee training subsidies, and financial assistance in locating key perSonnel.", "The mill will eventually have the capacity to produce 180,000 tons of newsprint a year, raising ANM'S total annual capacity to more than 380,000 tons. More than 90 percent of the raw material furnished would be thermomechanical pulp produced at the mill; the remainder will be imported in the form of bleached sulfate pulp. About 450,000 cubic meters-year of radiata pine is available from about 53,000 hectares of State-owned forest in the area around Albury. ANM presently operates a newsprint mill in Tasmania, and the combined production from both Mills would satisfy about 70 percent of Australia's annual newsprint consumption. This will reduce the country's dependence on imported newsprint\u2014 about 200,000 tons annually, mainly from New ", "Zealand ", "and Canada\u2014and will save about A$70 million in foreign exchange.", "The planning and design of the mill is well under way, and the selection of equipment has reached an advanced", "stage. The ", "project, ", "which is due for completion in 1981, has been welcomed by state and local governments of New South Wales, although there have been some protests from a wide range of community groups, following environmental and economic impact studies on the proposed mill. The ", "project ", "will provide employment for about 800 people during the construction phase, and 650 people when in actual operation. It has been reported that about A-100 million will be borrowed from domestic sources for the ", "project ", "by ANM, with additional capital sought overseas.", "The decision by ANM to construct the new mill at Albury could put the ", "company ", "in direct competition with one of its major shareholders, New Zealand's Tasman Pulp and Paper Co.

Raja Garuda Mas is located at Besitong in North Sumatra province near the border with Aceh. Established in 1974, the firm began operations with only a plywood mill but, in the intervening years, has added two sawmill units and a plant which produces wood-cement panels for prefabricated houses.", "In addition to plywood for construction purposes, the facility also turns out decorative veneer for furniture. Most of the equipment in the plywood plant is of Japanese manufacture though there were two large peelers from a U.S. manufacturer, Production Machinery Inc. of Portland, Oregon. Capacity of the plywood operation is 12,000-15,000 sheets (measuring four feet by eight feet, with a thickness of four millimeters) per day. The plant operates 24 hours per day with the exception of 2 days each month when shut down for maintenance.", "Garuda Mas' sawmill units were set up in 1977 to", "19", "comply with an Indonesian Government regulation compelling holders of timber concessions to process logs locally. As at the plywood facility, most of the equipment was imported from Japan.", "Also in 1977, the ", "company ", "began to manufacture wood-cement panels using as raw material the waste from its plywood and sawmill operations. Wood waste is chipped in a hammer mill, and is washed and mixed with cement to produce panels measuring one meter by twenty centimeters, with a thickness of five centimeters. These panels are used principally in the construction of low-cost, prefabricated houses. At present Garuda Mas produces about 3,000 panels per day.", "Garuda Mas obtains its timber from large concessions controlled by the firm in Aceh province, near the town of Idi. Logs are floated down the Besitong River to the plant site on the river bank. The river also serves as the company's inlet for imported raw materials, which are brought in by barge, mainly from Singapore. Most of the finished products are trucked to Medan's port, Belawan, for shipment to Java or abroad.", "P.T. Lontar Papyrus Paper Industry", "Established in 1974, Lontar Papyrus Paper Industry is situated in Aceh province, about twenty kilometers from the town of Langsa. The sole owner of the facility is a Medan resident of Chinese descent. Except for two technicians from Taiwan, the plant is staffed by local Indonesians. Much of the plant's equipment, which appears quite modern, is from Taiwan, though there is some from Japan and West Germany as well. Raw material, in the form of boxed pulp, is imported from the Scandinavian countries, Canada and the United States.

Most of the increase was in the Appalachian hardwood region which produced 20 percent of the hardwood lumber in the first half of 1978. Actual production in the Appalachian region was 628 million board feet, up 14 percent over last year. In the Southern hardwood region, hardwood lumber production for the same period was 1,457 million board feet, only slightly higher (1 percent) than last year. The remaining hardwood producing regions, the majority in the North Central States, produced 1,075 million board feet through June 1978, a 5 percent increase over the same period last year.", "Imports of hardwood lumber remained practically at the same level as the first 6 months of last year at 159 million board feet, with Canada supplying 31 percent, Brazil 24 percent, Malaysia 15 percent, and the Philippines 9 percent. Exports of hardwood lumber ran slightly ahead of imports at 163 million board feet. Canada purchased 50 percent of U.S. hardwood lumber exports, followed by France 17 percent, West Germany 13 percent, and the Netherlands 8 percent. Therefore, with production at 3,160 million board feet and exports and imports at the above levels, hardwood lumber imports account for 5 percent of domestic hardwood lumber apparent consumption.", "Lighter-colored hardwoods, such as oak, are replacing the once dominant darkwoods, such as walnut, in furniture manufacturing. Teakwood is especially expensive as a result of the self-imposed embargo on the export of unprocessed wood products from Thailand. Thailand is the major U.S. source of high quality teak, which is still unrivaled in boat deck construction. U.S. importers and boat builders are seeking to persuade the Thai's to reverse their embargo decision.", "Hardwood Plywood", "Hardwood plywood imports for the first half of 1978 were 2,440 million square feet (MMSF-surface measure), 12 percent above the similar period last year. The Republic of Korea was the major supplier at 1,326 MMSF or 53 percent. Taiwan was the next largest supplier at 31 percent, followed by Japan 7 percent, and the Philippines 5 percent. Hardwood plywood with a Philippine mahogany (sometimes called lauan) face accounted for 45 percent of hardwood plywood imports.", "Although monthly production figures for hardwood plywood are not available, yearly figures are published by the Bureau of the Census. In 1977, hardwood plywood production was 1,478 MMSF, an 8 percent increase over 1976. Manufacturers' shipments of hardwood plywood were 1,339 MMSF in 1977, valued at $4.68 million. Imports of hardwood plywood for domestic consumption", "were 4,186 MMSF valued at $429 million in 1977. Therefore, imports as a percent of domestic consumption were 76.5 percent (quantity basis) in 1977. U.S. exports of hardwood plywood were minimal at 4.1 percent of manufacturers' shipments. Manufacturers' shipments of hardwood plywood shipped in the unfinished state (to prefinishers) were 859 MMSF or 64 percent of manufacturers' shipments. The remaining 36 percent was shipped as prefinished; i.e., hardwood plywood manufactured and prefinished in the same establishment. Prefinished hardwood plywood made from purchased plywood was 2,190 MMSF. Purchases were made from domestic and foreign manufacturers. The South Atlantic States produced 44 percent of the quantity of production of veneer core (type II, moisture resistant) hardwood playwood in 1977. Type II, moistureresistant hardwood plywood represented 75 percent of hardwood plywood production in 1977. The Pacific States accounted for 34 percent of production, the East and North Central States 9 percent, the New England and Middle Atlantic States 6 percent. Although the Pacific States supplied 34 percent of production, only 51 percent of net volume of hardwood sawtimber on commercial timberland in the United States is located on the West Coast. Therefore, most of the hardwood plywood produced on the West Coast is dependent on hardwood veneer imports. Hardwood veneer imports in 1977 were 1,703 MMSF, an increase of 7 percent over 1976. In the first 6 months of 1978, imports were 794 MMSF, a decrease of 5 percent over the same period in 1977. Canada was the leading supplier of hardwood veneer to the United States\u2014mostly birch at 401 MMSF or 51 percent of U.S. imports from January\u2013June 1978. The Philippines was the second largest supplier of hardwood veneers to the United States at 188 MMSF or a 24 percent import share; Brazil supplied 85 MMSF or 11 percent; Peru 22 MMSF or 3 percent; and Malaysia, Indonesia, and Taiwan each supplied 1 percent. The Republic of Korea and Taiwan, the two largest suppliers of hardwood plywood to the United States, depend on Southeast Asian countries for their raw material supply\u2014hardwood logs. Japan is also a major importer of Southeast Asian hardwood logs. The supply of hardwood logs from the tropical less-developed countries to these producing countries May undergo major changes in the next two decades. Primarily, major forestry and wood product industry projects in these countries are aimed at developing the forest products industry to an extent that timber harvested would be converted to lumber, plywood, or paper products domestically, and then sold for internal consumption or export. Significant progress in industry development will, however, take some time\u2014at least until the end of the century. More importantly, however, is the alarming", "\nrate of deforestation in the developing countries of South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. At a June 1978 conference in Washington, D.C., private and public officials met to discuss the deforestation problem and its social, environmental, and economic implications for these countries and the world. Deforestration was attributed to (1) the expanding population's need to clear", "land for settlement and agriculture and (2) the extensive use of wood for fuel. While land clearing and settlement are considered as economic progress by the general population, such consequences as erosion, endangering delicate ecosystems, climate changes, and decrease of world wood supply are the results.", "SWEDISH PULP AND PAPER INDUSTRY: 1977 ", "REVIEW ", "AND OUTLOOK", "By the American Embassy in Stockholm", "Summary", "The recession in Sweden's key pulp and paper industry, one of the mainstays of the nation's prosperity and economic stability, continued through calender year 1977. Pulp and paper export prices remained very depressed throughout the year and yielded little or no profit to producers. By year's end, several companies found themselves in a precarious financial situation, and some were on the verge of bankruptcy. However, the ini-tial months of 1978 appeared to mark a turning point not only for Sweden's pulp and paper industry but for the West European industry as well. Economic activity in Western Europe seemed, at long last, to be on the upturn, and this was favorably reflected in a growing demand for pulp and paper. Moreover, the pressure from North American producers has eased in the West European market as a result of the rising demand for pulp and paper at home.", "Around mid-1978, optimism was growing in Sweden's pulp and paper industry. The large pulp inventories built up by Mills during 3 lean years to sustain mill employment have finally been brought down to normal operating levels. The backlog of orders for pulp and paper is increasing, mill operations are being stepped up, and export sales prices are being adjusted upward, though still not enough to compensate producers fully for their growing costs.", "Industry Remained Depressed in 1977", "The year 1977 brought little relief to Sweden's hardhit pulp industry. The total volume of export shipments in that year was no larger than in 1976 due mainly to the unsatisfactory rate of economic activity in Western Europe, which normally takes about 90 percent of Sweden's aggregate pulp exports. Other factors adversely affecting Sweden's pulp export trade were the continued high domestic cost inflation; the unstable currency market, particularly the declining U.S. dollar rate; and the keen competition in Sweden's traditional West European pulp market from North American, notably Canadian, producers. To meet the increasing North American competi. tion, the Swedish pulp industry was forced to make several", "downward price adjustments during 1977, and this occurred at a time when cost inflation at home was at an unprecedented level. This, of course, aggravated the already grave problems confronting Swedish pulp producers, bringing many of them to the verge of bandruptcy.", "The market situation in 1977 called for curtailed operations at many Mills. As a result, the industry as a whole used only 68 percent of its existing productive capacity during the year. A Bright spot in an otherwise cloudy picture was that the industry, largely through production cutbacks and intensive selling efforts in nonEuropean markets, was successful in bringing down mill pulp inventories from the costly and unwieldly level of well over 1.5 million metric tons at the end of 1976 to just over a million tons at the end of 1977. This heavy financial burden on Swedish pulp companies, resulting from previous Government-supported pulp inventory buildups to sustain mill employment, was thus well on the way to being eliminated late in 1977, which augured well for mill production during the months ahead. For data on Swedish production and exports of wood pulp by grade, see figures 1 and 2.", "Only 73 Percent of Capacity Used in 1977", "In terms of capacity utilization, Sweden's paper industry did better than the pulp industry during 1977. Production of paper and paperboard in that year totaled 5.1 million metric tons. This represented a gain of 2.3 percent over 1976 but, due to several new additions to plant facilities, production in 1977 amounted to only 73 percent of the industry's rated productive capacity. A relatively slow growth rate in West European paper and board consumption in conjunction with varying exchange rates and depressed prices were factors adversely affecting developments in Sweden's paper industry. Export shipments, however, were maintained at a relatively satisfactory level, but at prices that yielded little or no profit to producers. Moreover, mill inventories of paper and board continued to accumulate during the year and effectively prevented producers from making any upward adjustments in export or home market prices.", "Sweden's exports of paper and board during 1977 totaled 3.7 million tons, compared to 3.4 million tons in 1976. The increase was attributed mainly to larger shipments of kraft liner, fluting paper, and various grades of", "\nprinting paper. A notable feature was that virtually all of the increase in exports attained during 1977 consisted of paper and board destined to countries outside the European Common Market, mainly to customers in Asia and Africa. For data on Swedish production and export of paper and board, see figures 3 and 4.", "Continued Freeze of EC Paper Ceilings", "Under the import tariff dismantling terms of Sweden's free trade agreement with the European Community (EC), tariffs on paper and board, except newsprint, imported from Sweden were lowered from 10 to 8 percent ad valorem effective July 1, 1977. The tariff dismantling schedule calls for a reduction in EC tariffs on most grades of paper and board from 12 percent in 1973 to zero duty by 1984. The next tariff cut to 6 percent is to be January 1, 1979.", "Eight import ceilings are enforced by the EC for specific categories of paper and board supplied by Sweden. Originally, it was the intention of the EC to raise these ceilings by 5 percent annually. Paper and board imports from Sweden in excess of these ceilings are, in most cases, dutiable at a penalty rate, which is the full rate of 12 percent ad valorem that existed before the free trade agreement was concluded. During 1977, Swedish exporters were obliged to pay penalty rates for exceeding four of the eight import ceilings. Early in 1978 it was announced that the EC, reportedly at the request of some member nations (France and Belgium were specifically mentioned in the Swedish press), had decided on a continued freeze of three ceilings during calendar year 1978. This means that the earlier intended 5 percent increase of those ceilings will not be implemented for the third year in succession. It is noted in this connection that the EC, in 1976, had reached a decision to freeze all eight of its ceilings for imports of Swedish paper and board. This move was taken in retaliation against the imposition in the same year of Swedish import restrictions on shoes.", "Outlook Improves for Pulp and Paper Industry", "The market Outlook for Sweden's pulp and paper industry, which early in 1978 was judged with considerable caution, not to say pessimism, is now generally regarded in industry circles to be improving. The industry foresees an improvement in its overall order book position during the months ahead, especially with respect to export orders. Developments since the end of 1977 indicate that the Western European economy is beginning to show signs of recovery, and although the upturn has been slight, it has already had a favorable effect on activity in Sweden's pulp and paper industry. Moreover, the rising demand for pulp", "and paper in North America is reported by Swedish trades to have eased the price pressure from North American producers in the West European market.", "Swedish pulp and paper industry spokesmen recently stated that they have now, for the first time since 1974, been enabled to make upward adjustments in export prices. This, they say is a welcome development not only because the EC Commission has accused Swedish and other Nordic producers, of dumping their chemical pulp in the EC market, but also because the Swedish industry will now be in a position to reduce somewhat the losses suffered in recent years. Swedish producers attribute their low price policy in the Common Market to the need for competing in prices with North American exporters. Growing demand at home is said to be reducing American and Canadian interest in the West European market. This, in conjunction with a continued sharp reduction in previously unwieldy mill pulp inventories, paved the way for some eagerly awaited improvements in Swedish pulp export prices. After having reduced prices to extremely low levels, the Swedish pulp industry was, at long last, in a position to announce upward price adjustments for export shipments during the third quarter of 1978. For major pulp grades, those prices are the following (per ton, cost, insurance, and freight\u2014c.i.f., West European ports): longfiber bleached sulfate\u2014$340; bleached sulfite\u2014 $325; birchwood pulp\u2014$320. Although these prices are from $15 to $20 higher than those previously quoted, they are still not quite adequate to compensate producers for their rising production costs. According to one industry official, a price of about $380 per ton for most major pulp grades would be needed to give producers what they now regard as a reasonable profit margin.", "According to industry sources, Sweden's pulp industry is expected to step up operations substantially during the second half of 1978 now that the previously large mill pulp inventories have been brought down to normal operating levels. As a result, the rate of capacity utilization in calendar 1978 is expected to average about 80 percent, compared to 68 percent in 1977. Total pulp production (chemical, semi-chemical, and mechanical, except defibrated and exploded pulps entering directly into hardboard and insulation board production) is expected to increase to 8.4 million metric tons in 1978 from 7.7 million tons in 1977, a gain of over 9 percent. This production increase will be made possible largely as the result of a recovery of markets in Western Europe previously lost to North American producers, and of a substantial increase in pulp shipments to Asian countries, notably Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. A rather substantial increase in paper and board production is also predicted. According to industry sources, output in 1978 is", "\nexpected to attain an all-time high and exceed that of 1977 by at least 12 percent.", "1978-83 Expansion Plans", "Despite several lean years, Sweden's pulp and paper industry plans to proceed with its expansion and plant improvement program during the coming 5-year period. This was revealed in a recent study conducted by the Swedish Pulp and Paper Association. The industry, however, has decided to go slow with the implementation of this program during 1978 and has cut back on previously earmarked investment in new plant and equipment for the current year. According to the study, the Swedish pulp industry's present annual capacity totals 1 1.5 million metric tons. This figure includes all grades of wood pulp (both captive and market pulps) but excludes defibrated and exploded pulps used directly for the manufacture of hardboard or insulation board. By 1983, total annual capacity is expected to amount to 12.5 million tons. The industry's present capacity of 11.5 million tons is distributed as follows: chemical pulp, 8.2 million tons; and semi-chemical pulp, 0.5 million tons. There will be little change in this capacity during 1979. As for paper, the industry's present plans call for an overall capacity increase of 1.3 million metric tons, to 8.3 million tons, by 1983. This is equivalent to an average annual increase of 3.5 percent. The industry's present capacity is distributed by major grades as follows: kraft papers, 1.4 million metric tons; newsprint, 1.6 million tons; other printing papers, 1.1 million tons; paperboard, 2.2 million tons (half of paperboard capacity consists of kraft liner); other papers, 0.7 million tons. Of the total planned capacity expansion, almost one million tons will be in paper grades, with the emphasis on newsprint. A new newsprint machine using chiefly", "FOREST PRODUCTS ", "REVIEW ", "recycled paper is scheduled to go into production at the end of 1978. In the case of paperboard, capacity additions totaling about 340,000 tons are planned. Most of this increase will be for kraft liner and bleached folding boxboard.", "Acquisition of Additional Corrugated Board Capacity Abroad", "Late in 1977, the Swedish Pulp and Paper Association announced that Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA), a leading Swedish forest industry concern, had acquired 80 percent of the share capital of the French corrugated fiberboard ", "company ", "Sofac-Socapa. Acquisition of the French ", "company, ", "which manufactures some 30,000 tons of corrugated fiberboard packaging material annually, gave SCA corrugated fiberboard manufacturing facilities in France a total capacity of about 125,000 tons yearly.", "In addition, SCA reportedly signed an agreement some months ago with the Anglo-Irish ", "Company ", "Jefferson/Smurfit under which the Swedish concern obtained 49 percent of the capital stock of jefferson/smurfit's corrugated fiberboard business in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. That business comprises eight corrugated fiberboard Mills and three converting plants with an aggregate annual capacity of 160,000 tons. These latest acquisitions brought the total corrugated fiberboard capacity of companies wholly and jointly owned by SCA to approximately 600,000 tons yearly.", "By purchasing an interest in paper-making and paperconverting facilities in foreign countries, SCA hopes to ensure a good and steady outlet for its own pulp and paper production in northern Sweden. Following these recent acquisitions, SCA now has an interest in corrugated fiberboard companies in Denmark, West Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and of course, Sweden.", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "Figure 1.

Raw material needs are particularly acute with respect to secondary fibers for the paper and board industry, long-fibered pulp for newsprint, and softwood timber for use in the construction industry. The pulp and paper industry is heavily dependent on imports, with 83 percent of all pulp requirements being imported. As these projects reach maturity, opportunities for U.S. businessmen will arise in construction, consulting/engineering, and equipment sales.", "Because of current pulp, short fiber, and timber shortages, Venezuela has embarked on an ambitious planting/development program for Caribbean pine and eucalyptus in the southern Anzoategui and northern Monagas State areas, respectively. The objective is to convert the Sabanas into a gigantic forestry and industry complex capable of supporting several pulp Mills that would not only supply domestic needs but also provide valuable export income. The two major government agencies responsible for these developments are Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) and Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CNR).", "Uverito ", "Project ", "The Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "was begun in 1969 by Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana with the intention of planting 218 million trees on 150,000 hectares by 1985, in order to produce long fiber pulp-mainly for the production of newsprint. Long fiber pulp is currently imported at an annual rate of 80,000 tons. Caribbean pine (Hondurensis), imported from Guatemala and other Central American countries, is the type of tree being planted. To date, about 80 million trees have been planted on 110,000 acres, with an additional 110 million planned for 1984. Plans are being made to harvest trees for pulp production in 1984. Eventually, 4,000 hectares out of every 10,000 will be harvested for pulp, with the remainder being conserved for timber production (maturity: about 10 to 15 years). By 1986, CVG expects to reach the 4,000 hectare level, with an expected yield of 180 cubic meters per hectare.

This was accomplished through aggressive market development and competitive pricing by the world market pulp producers. In the soft world market and aggressive selling atmosphere in the first half of the year, U.S. export market pulp lost some ground from volumes shipped during January\u2013June 1977\u20131.306 million short tons compared with 1.378 million short tons of exports (table S-14). Pulp exports, however, are only a small part (5 percent) of total U.S. pulp production. Market pulp Mills, operating at about 96 percent of capacity during January\u2013June according to the American Paper Institute (API), compared with a 94 percent operating rate during the 1977 period, funneled more of their pulps toward the domstic paper, paperboard and allied products Mills.", "Total woodpulp production of captive, or integrated and market pulp Mills is reported at 24 million tons for the first 6 months of 1978, compared with 23.9 million tons for the 1977 period (table S-3). These data, however, are incomplete because the date covering miscellaneous \u201cother\u201d grades of pulp, including defibrated, exploded, screenings and related wood fibers, are not available. The final pulp production figure will probably approach 25.5 million tons for January\u2013June 1977. On an annual basis, pulp production would approximate 51.3 million tons for 1978; up from an estimated 50 plus million tons for 1977, and from 48.8 million tons for 1976. Thus, the pulp industry has been producing to meet a slowly improving demand for its product. Producer inventory data are not yet available from the Bureau of the Census; but API data indicate no inventory building at the pulp Mills. Pulp inventories at the converting Mills also show essentially no change from 1977 levels (table S-4, table S-5).", "The leading pulp grades in demand in both domestic and export markets continue to be the bleached and unbleached sulfates (table S-3, table S-14). The total of all sulfate pulp grades, at 18.1 million tons for the first 6 months, was 500,000 tons or 2.8 percent over 1977 sixmonth figures. This tonnage also continues, as in 1977, to represent nearly 75 percent of the total reported 24.0 million tons of pulp production. Production of groundwood grades, including growing volumes of thermomechanical pulps, decreased from 2.3 million tons in the 1977 period to 2.1 million tons for January-June 1978. Semi-chemical pulp production also Fell slightly, from 2.1 million tons to 2.0 million tons for 1978. The production of corrugating medium, based on this pulp, Fell; while the use of wastepapers in a combination furnished medium increased (table S-5). This increased use of wastepaper in combination medium furnishes, especially old corrugated, is reflected in the wastepaper consumption data, by grade (table S-2). Old corrugated consumption at the user Mills, at 2.5 million tons, grew 460,000 tons or 17 percent over 1977 six-month consumption figures.", "The production of Special alpha and dissolving pulps dropped slightly from 1977 figures (table S-3). This is reflected in the 8 percent reduced consumption of those grades (table S-5) at the non-paper Mills, where producers of rayon fibers, cellophane and related chemical-converted pulp-based products are being steadily challenged in the market by other man-made fibers, filaments and films. The reduction of Special alpha and dissolving pulp production was also influenced by a drop in exports of these grades from 413,000 tons in January\u2013June 1977 to 403,000 for the 1978 period: a drop of 2.4 percent in exports (table S-14).", "The total picture, however, for the pulp producers during January\u2013June 1978 has been one of some improvement. The estimated final 1978 pulp production figure, at 51.3 million tons, will be an all-time record high; close to 2.5 percent above 1977 production.

Growing demand, stemming from the second quarter upturn in the U.S. economy as well as buying by offshore economies, provided added impetus to the 1978 growth of paper and board production. As reported by the Bureau of the Census, U.S. paper and board output in the second quarter totaled 16.3 million tons, a gain of 5.3 percent over the first quarter figure. For the half year, production equalled 30.8 million tons, 3.5 percent higher than the comparable year-ago level. As published by the American Paper Institute, the capacity utilization rates for paper Mills averaged 93.4 percent in the first 6 months of 1978 while those for paperboard Mills averaged 91.9 percent in the same period. Capacity utilization rates in the comparable period a year ago averaged 91.7 percent and 91.1 percent, respectively. Production of the paper grades, which amounted to 7.4 million tons in the second quarter, was up 2.3 percent over the first quarter figure and totaled 14.6 million tons for the first 6 months of the year, a 5.9 percent increase over the comparable 1977 period. Reflecting sharp gains in the nondurables sector and a pickup in export trade, the packaging-oriented paperboard segment showed a ", "7.7 ", "percent favorable quarter-to-quarter change and totaled 14.3 million tons in the January\u2013June period. Since the growth pattern emulated that shown in 1977, there was only a small improvement in the comparative 1977-78 half-year totals. Production of the building paper and board components, reflecting the continued high level of construction activity, climbed 8.9 percent higher in the second quarter and amounted to 2.8 million tons for the first half of 1978, a 4.9 percent increase over the first 6 months of 1977. In the paper sector, year-to-year improvements were evident in production of virtually all grades of paper but continued to be centered mainly in the printing and writing papers, which are currently reflecting the expanding demand from the burgeoning magazine industry and continuing growth in overall advertising. As a group, printing and writing paper represents the bulk of all paper output, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total paper output. Production of these papers was up 8.5 percent in the first half of 1978 compared with the similar period in 1977. The other two major paper grade sectors, tissues and coarse papers were up 3.1 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. Preliminary reports on second quarter production of some paper grades such as newsprint, coated two-sides printing papers, bristols, and the bag and sack papers, indicated lower second quarter output. Paperboard production finished the second quarter on the upbeat with a notable trend in the quickening tempo of linerboard production. Production of linerboard, the bedrock for the industry, increased 6.6 percent in the", "second quarter and totaled 6.8 million tons for the half year. Annualized, the second quarter rate would represent record production levels. Output of the combination paperboard grades, which use wastepaper as the major fiber source, moved up in the second quarter but finished the half year only 1.6 percent higher than the same period a year ago. Production of the bleached paperboard grades showed a comparative year-to-year decline of 14 percent as a strong second quarter performance, particularly in milk carton stock, was unable to offset a poor first quarter output and a similar strong second quarter showing a year ago. Second quarter production of the building paper and board grades was 8.7 percent higher than the first quarter total.

This was an 11 percent increase over the same period in 1977. Actual starts of residential construction for the first 6 months showed 986,400 starts, an increase of 4.0 percent. Single family dwellings comprised 72 percent of the total housing starts, compared to 75 percent a year earlier. The percent of single family starts is a key indicator for solid wood product demand since more lumber and plywood are used in single family construction than in multiple unit construction. In general, common walls and use of substitute materials such as brick and block in multi-family construction reduce the amount of structural wood products used.", "Lumber", "For the first 6 months of 1978, production, shipments, and orders received of softwood lumber were running slightly less than the same period in 1977. Production of softwood lumber was less than half of one percent below the first half of 1977, while shipments were 1 percent less and orders received were about 2 1/2 percent less. The reduced levels of production and orders of softwood lumber during such a high rate of demand possibly reflect the severe winter weather over the first part of the year, reducing logging operations and construction activity, and the anticipation by lumber wholesalers that housing demand\u2014thus lumber demand\u2014will taper off by the end of 1978.", "Specifically, softwood lumber production in the southern pine region for the first 6 months of 1978 was essentially the same as in 1977; the Douglas fir region showed a 4.8 percent increase in production; the western pine region a 4.0 percent decrease; the California redwood region, a 6.3 percent decrease, and other softwood regions at virtually the same pace. The southern pine region produced 26 percent of the total softwood lumber for January\u2013June 1978; 30 percent for the Douglas fir region, 31 percent for the western pine region, and 7.3 percent for the California redwood region. Therefore, the Pacific Northwest continues to produce the majority of the softwood lumber needs for the domestic and export market. However, indications are that the direction of", "flow of softwood lumber from the Southern and Pacific Northwest-producing region are changing. Freight rates on the Nation's rail lines from the Pacific Northwest to the northeastern consuming regions are, according to industry sources, becoming cost prohibitive. The southern producing region (basically the southeastern States) has an increasing advantage in the freight proportion of the lumber costs to the northeastern wholesaler. Also, various sources indicate that the Pacific Northwest producers are directing sales to western markets and export. U.S. exports of softwood lumber to all countries for the first six months of 1978 were 703 million board feet, a 12 percent decrease from the same period last year. Japan and Canada were the two leading purchasers of U.S. softwood lumber, buying 203 and 193 million board feet, respectively. These two countries purchased 56 percent of U.S. lumber exports. Australian purchases ranked third at 68 million board feet and Italy ranked fourth at 58 million board feet.

The Republic of Korea (South Korea) increased its U.S. softwood log purchases by 250 percent in the first 6 months of 1978 over the same period in 1977, to 225 million board feet or 13 percent of the export volume. Industry sources indicate that Korea's purchases of U.S. softwood logs are ultimately consumed by (1) the domestic market, and (2) the export market, to either Europe or Japan. The lower wage rates of the Korean forest products industry allow these products to be exported competitively with the United States.", "Imports of U.S. softwood sawtimber logs were virtually negligible in comparison to consumption at 41 million board feet, for the first 6 months of 1978. Practically all U.S. imports of softwood logs come from Canada. Canada regulates the export of unprocessed softwood logs with the intent to export only softwood logs that are in excess supply of domestic demand. The United", "\nStates prohibits the export of softwood logs from Federal lands (basically National Forest lands), but does not prohibit export of logs from State and private lands. Softwood log exports have been controversial in the United States, especially during high domestic demand cycles.", "Lumber Imports", "Imports of softwood lumber, on the other hand, consistute a significant proportion of U.S. consumption of that item.

Canada continues to dominate the import share with 99 percent of total U.S. purchases of softwood lumber. In the first 6 months of 1978 imports accounted for 27 percent of apparent U.S. domestic consumption. For the first half of 1977, imports of softwood lumber accounted for 25 percent of apparent domestic consumption. The devaluation of the Canadian dollar, low Canadian raw material costs, and relatively cheap transportation, especially from Bri-tish Columbia to eastern U.S. markets, have helped the Canadian exporters market their softwood products in this country.", "Plywood", "Softwood plywood production for the first 6 months of 1978 was 10,157 million board feet (3/8-inch basis), a 2 percent increase over the like period in 1977. Shipments of softwood plywood ran slightly less, however, Orders received were 1 percent greater for the first 6 months of this year over the like period last year. Exports of softwood plywood of 176 million square feet were running slightly less than the volume exported by mid-year 1977. The major drop in total volume of softwood plywood exports from 1976 to 1977 of 60 percent was due in major part, to (1) the increase in domestic demand for softwood plywood in 1977-78, (2) the Canadian resolution of Labor disputes in their forest products industry, and (3) the devaluation of the Canadian dollar. Also, the strong market for U.S. plywood in Canada in 1976 quickly diminished in 1977. Imports of softwood plywood are virtually negligible as a part of domestic consumption at 18 million square feet for the first 6 months of this year, and represent less than one-half of one percent of the apparent domestic consumption of softwood plywood.", "Softwood Prices", "Softwood lumber Producers Price Index (PPI\u2014formerly Wholesale Price Index) increased 22 percent from", "June 1977 to June 1978, and increased 16 percent from December 1977 to June of this year. The relatively high price increases of lumber and plywood compared to the \u201call commodities\u201d index led to President Carter\u2019s remark in his April 11, 1978, anti-inflation message that directed the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Council on Environmental Quality to find ways to increase timber sales from Federal lands. Increased timber sales from National Forests would, hopefully, ease supply price pressures on lumber and wood products. Another issue that would potentially affect timber sales volume, is the Road less Area ", "Review ", "and Evaluation (RARE II). About 62 million acres of roadless and undeveloped National Forest land are being reviewed under RARE II for the completion of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The RARE II process of land-use planning should be completed by the end of 1978. The industry points to the 26.5 million acres of commerical forest land being reviewed under RARE II as a necessary timber source to meet the projected rising demand for timber products until the end of the century.", "Other softwood product PPI'S in June 1978 were millwork at 244.9, a 27 percent increase over June 1977; softwood plywood at 236.0, a 16 percent increase over June 1977; and softwood veneer at 249.1 (1971=100), a 36 percent increase over last year.", "The current housing boom was the key factor in price increases to above a 20 percent level in the 1-year period. However, the increasing cost of raw material (the softwood log) to the primary producers of softwood products over the past several years is also an important factor influencing price increases. For instance, U.S. Forest Service statistics show that Douglas fir peeler (used for veneer and eventually plywood) log prices increased on the average from 1971 to 1977 about 19 percent each year to around $300 per thousand board feet. In 1971, Douglas fir peeler logs were selling at $128 per thousand. Douglas fir sawtimber log prices showed an average annual increase of 23.4 percent from 1971 to 1977 or a total of 163.5 percent in the 7-year period. The average price of all grades of Douglas fir sawtimber logs in 1977 was about $227 per MBF.", "Prices quoted are for water and inland sales used in domestic consumption. Export sales have generally been at considerably higher prices than domestic sales. In 1977, the price differential between domestic and export log sales was about $85 per thousand board feet for Douglas fir peeler logs, due partly to the higher grade of peeler logs sold for export.", "Hardwoods", "Hardwood lumber production for the first 6 months of 1978 was 3,160 million board feet, about a 5 percent", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "@book{united1978forest,\n  title={Forest Products Review},\n  author={United States.

", "VENEZUELA'S MAJOR FORESTRY PROJECTS", "(Excerpted from American Embassy-Caracas Report)", "Summary", "Venezuela has begun a number of large forestry projects to satisfy the fiber requirements of that nation's pulp and paper Mills. Raw material needs are particularly acute with respect to secondary fibers for the paper and board industry, long-fibered pulp for newsprint, and softwood timber for use in the construction industry. The pulp and paper industry is heavily dependent on imports, with 83 percent of all pulp requirements being imported. As these projects reach maturity, opportunities for U.S. businessmen will arise in construction, consulting/engineering, and equipment sales.", "Because of current pulp, short fiber, and timber shortages, Venezuela has embarked on an ambitious planting/development program for Caribbean pine and eucalyptus in the southern Anzoategui and northern Monagas State areas, respectively. The objective is to convert the Sabanas into a gigantic forestry and industry complex capable of supporting several pulp Mills that would not only supply domestic needs but also provide valuable export income. The two major government agencies responsible for these developments are Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) and Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CNR).", "Uverito ", "Project ", "The Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "was begun in 1969 by Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana with the intention of planting 218 million trees on 150,000 hectares by 1985, in order to produce long fiber pulp-mainly for the production of newsprint. Long fiber pulp is currently imported at an annual rate of 80,000 tons. Caribbean pine (Hondurensis), imported from Guatemala and other Central American countries, is the type of tree being planted. To date, about 80 million trees have been planted on 110,000 acres, with an additional 110 million planned for 1984. Plans are being made to harvest trees for pulp production in 1984. Eventually, 4,000 hectares out of every 10,000 will be harvested for pulp, with the remainder being conserved for timber production (maturity: about 10 to 15 years). By 1986, CVG expects to reach the 4,000 hectare level, with an expected yield of 180 cubic meters per hectare. CVG will require forestry equipment and technical assistance for the extraction process.", "In preparation for the harvesting period, CVG has plans to build a pulp mill capable of producing 200,000 tons annually, which should be completed by the 1984 deadline. Decisions on outside equity participation and exact composition have yet to be made, but the mill will be separately managed from the rest of the forestry ", "proj", "ect, and probably will be structured in the manner of other CVG corporations such as SIDOR, VENALUM. and ALCASE. While a feasibility study had been made at the initial conception of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project, ", "it considered tropical woods rather than pines as the basic raw material. A probable timetable for Uverito development is: late 1978-79 for new feasibility studies; 1979-81 for decisions on equity participation; 1981-82 for start of construction; and 1984 for start-up of production.", "CONARE", "Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CONARE) was created in August 1975, with the mandate to take responsibility for Venezuela's forestry industry (excluding Uverito). Under Federal decree No. 1341 of December 16, 1975, CONARE was authorized to incorporate the private sector into Venezuela's forestry programs. While CONARE has several small experimental forests throughout the country, its major area of development is in South Anzoategui and Monagas States, on land owned by the National Agrarian Institute. Here CONARE has about 100,000 hectares which it plans to divide into seven huge blocks and to develop, in conjunction with its Venezuelan and foreign partners, a large Caribbean pine and eucalyptus plantation.", "Companies established by CONARE include: (1) Corporacion Forestal Guayamure, with an area of about 10,000 hectares of Caribbean pine; (2) Forestor, with an area of 75,000 hectares which will be planted to eucalyptus to support a 300,000 ton-year pulp mill; and (3) Corporacion Forestal Sipao S.A., which will plant 18,000 hectares of short-fibered eucalyptus.", "Other Projects", "Corporation Venezolana de Fomento is doing a feasibility study for a bagasse mill at Rio Turbio. Industry", "\nsources are skeptical of this project's success, in part due to water shortages in the area. A ", "project ", "to construct a short fiber mill in Central Portuguesa is also being considered. While no construction has begun, several firms have placed orders for its production.", "Equipment", "With harvesting periods due around 1984, and with initial experimental thinnings already started, the demand for forestry equipment should begin to increase. The manager of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "has already visited the United States to study equipment. The proximity of the United States, which facilitates maintenance, is an important competitive factor.", "In response to the upcoming increases in supply of raw materials there appears to be a new interest in investment in paper machines; several local firms are considering purchases of new machines in the near future. However, industry members are awaiting changes in Government price control policy before making large investments.", "Forestry studies have indicated the need for improved planting methods. Consequently, there should be new purchases of equipment to plant and maintain forests.

", "Centralized Management", "There has been considerable discussion concerning the placing of Venezuela's forest and pulp industry under one government coordinating agency. Since most of the forestry projects are located in the same area (southern Anzoategui, Monagas, and Uverito) coordination between the entities developing these areas will be required for long-term investments such as pulp Mills. Plans call for a ministerial level commission to coordinate forestry development between Uverito, CONARE, and the private sector. It is reported that the Government is considering consolidating the industry under CONARE'S manageIn ent.", "RECENT DEVELOPMENTS", "1. Newsprint Mill Planned in Australia", "Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd. (ANM) has announced a go-ahead for construction of a A$155 million newsprint mill at Albury, in New South Wales. The New South Wales Government had encouraged the construction of the mill with various incentives, including housing, payroll tax rebates, machinery subsidies, employee training subsidies, and financial assistance in locating key perSonnel.", "The mill will eventually have the capacity to produce 180,000 tons of newsprint a year, raising ANM'S total annual capacity to more than 380,000 tons. More than 90 percent of the raw material furnished would be thermomechanical pulp produced at the mill; the remainder will be imported in the form of bleached sulfate pulp. About 450,000 cubic meters-year of radiata pine is available from about 53,000 hectares of State-owned forest in the area around Albury. ANM presently operates a newsprint mill in Tasmania, and the combined production from both Mills would satisfy about 70 percent of Australia's annual newsprint consumption. This will reduce the country's dependence on imported newsprint\u2014 about 200,000 tons annually, mainly from New ", "Zealand ", "and Canada\u2014and will save about A$70 million in foreign exchange.", "The planning and design of the mill is well under way, and the selection of equipment has reached an advanced", "stage. The ", "project, ", "which is due for completion in 1981, has been welcomed by state and local governments of New South Wales, although there have been some protests from a wide range of community groups, following environmental and economic impact studies on the proposed mill. The ", "project ", "will provide employment for about 800 people during the construction phase, and 650 people when in actual operation.

Most of the equipment in the plywood plant is of Japanese manufacture though there were two large peelers from a U.S. manufacturer, Production Machinery Inc. of Portland, Oregon. Capacity of the plywood operation is 12,000-15,000 sheets (measuring four feet by eight feet, with a thickness of four millimeters) per day.

Wood waste is chipped in a hammer mill, and is washed and mixed with cement to produce panels measuring one meter by twenty centimeters, with a thickness of five centimeters. These panels are used principally in the construction of low-cost, prefabricated houses. At present Garuda Mas produces about 3,000 panels per day.", "Garuda Mas obtains its timber from large concessions controlled by the firm in Aceh province, near the town of Idi. Logs are floated down the Besitong River to the plant site on the river bank.

Butts", "Pulpwood", "Deliveries of domestically produced pulpwood to U.S. pulp Mills during January\u2013June 1978 substantially accelerated over the relatively flat first quarter, which was roughly equal to the first quarter of 1977. This year's 6 month deliveries of domestic wood were 660,000 cords over 1977 deliveries, with nearly all of the increase occurring during April\u2013June (table S-2). It appears that the severe winter of 1977-78 (as in 1976-77) slowed logging and hauling activities, but that lost timber production was made up after spring arrived. Softwoods were 75 percent of total domestic wood deliveries while hardwoods provided 25 percent. Pulpwood imports during the first half-year of this year accelerated significantly over 1977 figures, with the nearly half-million cords being 28 percent over yearearlier figures. Thus, total mill pulpwood receipts of 38.6 million cords (domestic and imported) for the JanuaryJune period are 800,000 cords or 2 percent over total receipts for the 1977 period. This figure compares with 36.9 million cords in 1976, up 1.7 million cords or close to 5 percent. As stated, in spite of reported slowdowns of logging activites due to severe winter and wet spring conditions in some areas, pulpwood deliveries to the Mills held up and increased slightly over 1977 figures. The climatic impact on wood supply could well have been softened by increased receipts of chips and sawdust. A check of American Pulpwood Association monthly reports on pulpwood receipts at the Mills shows that mill deliveries of wood residuals\u2014chips and sawdust\u2014during JanuaryJune 1978 increased nearly 18 percent over 1977 while the roundwood form of pulpwood deliveries increased only one-half of one percent. These residuals, or waste chiefly from lumber and plywood mill operations and other timber converting plants, supplied 44 percent of pulpwood deliveries during the 1978 period, up from 40 percent during the comparable months of 1977. Availability of such residues for pulping is directly related to log conversion in the lumber and plywood sec", "tors; which, in turn, is related to the level of housing starts and general construction activity. A high level of activity in solid wood product demand has led to availability of substantial supplies of residual chips and sawdust at the converting Mills. Such waste residuals as pulpwood also supply a generally strong export market. However, chip (pulpwood) exports (table S-14), primarily to Japan, shows only a 27,000-cord increase. Thus the indications are that increased pulpwood requirements at the domestic pulp Mills in 1978 have been met by a combination of increased receipts of pulpwood, mainly wood residuals, and a drawdown of woodyard inventories. Mill pulpwood inventories at the end of June totaled 5.0 million cords, down 360,000 cords from March 31 levels and 1.2 million cords during the first 6 months, or 19 percent below the level of December 31, 1977. The volume of pulpwood consumed in pulp manufacture has shown growth closely correlated to the combination of increased mill pulpwood receipts and a substantial drawdown of mill wood inventories. Total U.S. consumption of pulpwood during January\u2013June 1978, at 39.8 million cords, is up 1.4 million cords or 3.7 percent from the comparable 1977 period. Leading regions in pulpwood consumption continue to be the South Central and South Atlantic, where Mills in each region utilized close to 12.7 million cords during the first 6 months of 1978, representing 64 percent of total U.S. pulpwood consumed. The 8.2 million cords consumed in western Mills (21 percent of the U.S. total) puts the region in third place; with the Northeast Mills (3.6 million cords), and the North Central Mills (2.7 million cords) a distant fourth and fifth. On a percentage basis, the greatest increase in pulpwood use occurred in the Northeast region's Mills\u2014up 17 percent. The regional pulpwood consumption data suggest a related increase in pulp production and capacity utilization in those States. However, regional pulp production data are not available. The first 6-months of data suggest that total pulpwood receipts at the Mills could approach 76.3 million cords by the end of 1978, up 3.8 percent from 73.5 million cords in", "(3)", "1977, and 4.8 percent over the 72.8 million cords delivered in 1976. Annual pulpwood consumption will grow at a slightly higher rate. The 6-month data suggest 1978 pulpwood annual consumption will be close to 79.7 million cords, 4.7 million cords or 6 percent over 1977 figures, and 6.5 million cords and 9 percent over 1976. Pulpwood consumption for the first half of 1978, adjusted to an annual rate, indicates that pulpwood production and deliveries must increase in the second half by about 2 million cords over the January\u2013June figures to satisfy mill requirements without the further drawing down of woodyard inventory levels. Currently, woodyard inventories are at their lowest point in 10 years. Except in the Northeast, regional pulpwood inventories at the Mills are down 300,000 to 400,000 cords from last year's levels in each region. With increasing emphasis on recovery of wastepaper as a source of paper and boardmaking fibers, the pressure to increase pulpwood supplies May soften during the last half of 1978.", "Wastepaper and Other Raw Materials", "The consumption of non-wood fibers in papermaking, such as straw, rags, and bagasse (table S-2) increased by 14,000 tons in the first half of 1978 over 1977. However, on an annual basis, consumption of nonwood fibers should be about 200,000 tons below 1976 levels. Nonwood fibers constitute a minor portion of the \u201cother\u201d fibrous materials utilized in pulp production.", "Wastepaper is the major secondary fiber raw materials source. Receipts of wastepaper at Mills during the first half of 1978 totaled 6.1 million tons and constituted 95 percent of the non-wood fibrous materials utilized. The January\u2013June data suggest that a total of about 12 million tons of all grades of wastepaper will be delivered to the Mills in 1978; compared with a reported 10.4 million tons received in 1977 and 12.2 million tons for 1976. Data from the Bureau of the Census for 1977 is preliminary. Figures for 1977 nonwood fibrous materials consumption are estimated to be 1.5 to 2.0 million tons too low, which would give a total of 12.0 to 12.4 million tons delivered.", "The primary data base improvements developing in 1978 are guidelines to industry reporting of wastepaper consumption. The data suggest that the full-year rate of wastepaper receipts will realistically reach 12.2 to 12.5 million tons for 1978. Wastepaper consumption at the paper, paperboard and related products Mills, is slightly more than 6 million tons for the first 6 months and roughly equals receipts. With the improved reporting, the full 1978 consumption of all wastepaper grades in such Mills should exceed the 12.1 million tons estimated for", "1977 by 2 to 3 percent above the 1976 level. The total for 1978 could possibly reach 12.5 million tons. During January-June, wastepaper receipts led consumption by about 60,000 tons. Excess receipts were reflected in 766,000 tons of inventories, up 8 percent over December 1977 figures and just 6,000 tons below the 1976 level. All these data combined indicate a relatively stable total demand for wastepaper as a raw material in the paper and board industry. The leading grades of wastepaper consumed continued to be the bulky grades, with old corrugated at 42 percent of the total, mixed waste at 24 percent, and waste news at 17 percent. Consumption of high grades of wastepaper varied little from year earlier figures because of competition from abundant and cheap virgin market pulp. The wastepaper inventories of 766,000 tons at paper, paperboard, and allied products Mills, increased about 9 percent over December and June 1977 inventories, and returned to the generally higher level reached in 1974. This increased inventory level could well be associated with the growing interest in and expansion or use of old corrugated in linerboard Mills as a portion of the fiber used in unbleached liner manufacture. The influence of this waste grade in the inventory trend is also seen in the substantial increase in consumption of old corrugated, which, over the 1978 six-month period, increased 360,000 tons, or 17 percent, over the like period in 1977. Exports of old corrugated during the period, at 255,000 tons, were nearly 30,000 tons behind 1977 six-month figures. A net gain of close to 330,000 tons in sales of old corrugated by the wastepaper industry appears to have been achieved. This net gain in movement of old corrugated does not make up, however, for the substantial export loss of 64,000 tons of high grade, higher value pulp substitutes, compared with 1977 exports. With European economies improving, European demand for U.S. papermaking fiber, including the high grade wastepapers, is expected to increase. Countries such as England, Sweden, Holland, Italy and West Germany, in their attempts to increase recovery and recycling of domestic wastepaper and reduce reliance upon wastepaper imports, will challenge U.S. wastepaper. Both the domestic and world fiber markets pose a very real challenge to the wastepaper industry to furnish quality packs in required volume at prices competitive with virgin pulp and indigenous wastepaper stocks. There is no indication that the cellulosic insulation industry, utilizing substantial volumes of old news, has recovered from the debacle of last winter.

The reduction of Special alpha and dissolving pulp production was also influenced by a drop in exports of these grades from 413,000 tons in January\u2013June 1977 to 403,000 for the 1978 period: a drop of 2.4 percent in exports (table S-14).", "The total picture, however, for the pulp producers during January\u2013June 1978 has been one of some improvement.

Growing demand, stemming from the second quarter upturn in the U.S. economy as well as buying by offshore economies, provided added impetus to the 1978 growth of paper and board production. As reported by the Bureau of the Census, U.S. paper and board output in the second quarter totaled 16.3 million tons, a gain of 5.3 percent over the first quarter figure. For the half year, production equalled 30.8 million tons, 3.5 percent higher than the comparable year-ago level. As published by the American Paper Institute, the capacity utilization rates for paper Mills averaged 93.4 percent in the first 6 months of 1978 while those for paperboard Mills averaged 91.9 percent in the same period. Capacity utilization rates in the comparable period a year ago averaged 91.7 percent and 91.1 percent, respectively.

Since the growth pattern emulated that shown in 1977, there was only a small improvement in the comparative 1977-78 half-year totals. Production of the building paper and board components, reflecting the continued high level of construction activity, climbed 8.9 percent higher in the second quarter and amounted to 2.8 million tons for the first half of 1978, a 4.9 percent increase over the first 6 months of 1977. In the paper sector, year-to-year improvements were evident in production of virtually all grades of paper but continued to be centered mainly in the printing and writing papers, which are currently reflecting the expanding demand from the burgeoning magazine industry and continuing growth in overall advertising. As a group, printing and writing paper represents the bulk of all paper output, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total paper output. Production of these papers was up 8.5 percent in the first half of 1978 compared with the similar period in 1977. The other two major paper grade sectors, tissues and coarse papers were up 3.1 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. Preliminary reports on second quarter production of some paper grades such as newsprint, coated two-sides printing papers, bristols, and the bag and sack papers, indicated lower second quarter output.

This was an 11 percent increase over the same period in 1977. Actual starts of residential construction for the first 6 months showed 986,400 starts, an increase of 4.0 percent. Single family dwellings comprised 72 percent of the total housing starts, compared to 75 percent a year earlier. The percent of single family starts is a key indicator for solid wood product demand since more lumber and plywood are used in single family construction than in multiple unit construction. In general, common walls and use of substitute materials such as brick and block in multi-family construction reduce the amount of structural wood products used.", "Lumber", "For the first 6 months of 1978, production, shipments, and orders received of softwood lumber were running slightly less than the same period in 1977. Production of softwood lumber was less than half of one percent below the first half of 1977, while shipments were 1 percent less and orders received were about 2 1/2 percent less. The reduced levels of production and orders of softwood lumber during such a high rate of demand possibly reflect the severe winter weather over the first part of the year, reducing logging operations and construction activity, and the anticipation by lumber wholesalers that housing demand\u2014thus lumber demand\u2014will taper off by the end of 1978.", "Specifically, softwood lumber production in the southern pine region for the first 6 months of 1978 was essentially the same as in 1977; the Douglas fir region showed a 4.8 percent increase in production; the western pine region a 4.0 percent decrease; the California redwood region, a 6.3 percent decrease, and other softwood regions at virtually the same pace. The southern pine region produced 26 percent of the total softwood lumber for January\u2013June 1978; 30 percent for the Douglas fir region, 31 percent for the western pine region, and 7.3 percent for the California redwood region. Therefore, the Pacific Northwest continues to produce the majority of the softwood lumber needs for the domestic and export market. However, indications are that the direction of", "flow of softwood lumber from the Southern and Pacific Northwest-producing region are changing. Freight rates on the Nation's rail lines from the Pacific Northwest to the northeastern consuming regions are, according to industry sources, becoming cost prohibitive. The southern producing region (basically the southeastern States) has an increasing advantage in the freight proportion of the lumber costs to the northeastern wholesaler. Also, various sources indicate that the Pacific Northwest producers are directing sales to western markets and export. U.S. exports of softwood lumber to all countries for the first six months of 1978 were 703 million board feet, a 12 percent decrease from the same period last year. Japan and Canada were the two leading purchasers of U.S. softwood lumber, buying 203 and 193 million board feet, respectively. These two countries purchased 56 percent of U.S. lumber exports. Australian purchases ranked third at 68 million board feet and Italy ranked fourth at 58 million board feet.

Exports of softwood plywood of 176 million square feet were running slightly less than the volume exported by mid-year 1977. The major drop in total volume of softwood plywood exports from 1976 to 1977 of 60 percent was due in major part, to (1) the increase in domestic demand for softwood plywood in 1977-78, (2) the Canadian resolution of Labor disputes in their forest products industry, and (3) the devaluation of the Canadian dollar. Also, the strong market for U.S. plywood in Canada in 1976 quickly diminished in 1977.

Old corrugated consumption at the user Mills, at 2.5 million tons, grew 460,000 tons or 17 percent over 1977 six-month consumption figures.", "The production of Special alpha and dissolving pulps dropped slightly from 1977 figures (table S-3). This is reflected in the 8 percent reduced consumption of those grades (table S-5) at the non-paper Mills, where producers of rayon fibers, cellophane and related chemical-converted pulp-based products are being steadily challenged in the market by other man-made fibers, filaments and films. The reduction of Special alpha and dissolving pulp production was also influenced by a drop in exports of these grades from 413,000 tons in January\u2013June 1977 to 403,000 for the 1978 period: a drop of 2.4 percent in exports (table S-14).", "The total picture, however, for the pulp producers during January\u2013June 1978 has been one of some improvement. The estimated final 1978 pulp production figure, at 51.3 million tons, will be an all-time record high; close to 2.5 percent above 1977 production. This improvement is geared to the 2.7 percent growth in paper and board production (table S-6).", "Paper and Board", "Preliminary data on paper and board apparent consumption (production + imports - exports) sets the quantity at 34.5 million tons for the January\u2013June 1978 period, a record rate. The second quarter rate of 16.8 million tons was 5.3 percent greater than that reported for the first quarter. The relationship of consumption to real GNP in 1978 (a commonly used measure) exceeds the norm and introduces the possibility of inventory accumulation as a factor for the variance. Inventories May have been built as", "\na hedge against possible paper industry strikes. Growing demand, stemming from the second quarter upturn in the U.S. economy as well as buying by offshore economies, provided added impetus to the 1978 growth of paper and board production. As reported by the Bureau of the Census, U.S. paper and board output in the second quarter totaled 16.3 million tons, a gain of 5.3 percent over the first quarter figure. For the half year, production equalled 30.8 million tons, 3.5 percent higher than the comparable year-ago level. As published by the American Paper Institute, the capacity utilization rates for paper Mills averaged 93.4 percent in the first 6 months of 1978 while those for paperboard Mills averaged 91.9 percent in the same period. Capacity utilization rates in the comparable period a year ago averaged 91.7 percent and 91.1 percent, respectively. Production of the paper grades, which amounted to 7.4 million tons in the second quarter, was up 2.3 percent over the first quarter figure and totaled 14.6 million tons for the first 6 months of the year, a 5.9 percent increase over the comparable 1977 period. Reflecting sharp gains in the nondurables sector and a pickup in export trade, the packaging-oriented paperboard segment showed a ", "7.7 ", "percent favorable quarter-to-quarter change and totaled 14.3 million tons in the January\u2013June period. Since the growth pattern emulated that shown in 1977, there was only a small improvement in the comparative 1977-78 half-year totals. Production of the building paper and board components, reflecting the continued high level of construction activity, climbed 8.9 percent higher in the second quarter and amounted to 2.8 million tons for the first half of 1978, a 4.9 percent increase over the first 6 months of 1977. In the paper sector, year-to-year improvements were evident in production of virtually all grades of paper but continued to be centered mainly in the printing and writing papers, which are currently reflecting the expanding demand from the burgeoning magazine industry and continuing growth in overall advertising. As a group, printing and writing paper represents the bulk of all paper output, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total paper output. Production of these papers was up 8.5 percent in the first half of 1978 compared with the similar period in 1977. The other two major paper grade sectors, tissues and coarse papers were up 3.1 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. Preliminary reports on second quarter production of some paper grades such as newsprint, coated two-sides printing papers, bristols, and the bag and sack papers, indicated lower second quarter output. Paperboard production finished the second quarter on the upbeat with a notable trend in the quickening tempo of linerboard production. Production of linerboard, the bedrock for the industry, increased 6.6 percent in the", "second quarter and totaled 6.8 million tons for the half year. Annualized, the second quarter rate would represent record production levels. Output of the combination paperboard grades, which use wastepaper as the major fiber source, moved up in the second quarter but finished the half year only 1.6 percent higher than the same period a year ago. Production of the bleached paperboard grades showed a comparative year-to-year decline of 14 percent as a strong second quarter performance, particularly in milk carton stock, was unable to offset a poor first quarter output and a similar strong second quarter showing a year ago. Second quarter production of the building paper and board grades was 8.7 percent higher than the first quarter total. Output of building papers, amounting to 1,006 thousand tons, represented a 13.8 percent improvement over the comparable 6-month period in 1977.", "Imports Up Markedly", "Aside from higher newsprint imports, which tradi-tionally amount to more than 60 percent of the total U.S. requirement of newsprint, imports in the past 2 years have been expanded because of higher domestic demand for printing papers, particularly coated lightweight magazine paper which is in tight supply in the United States. For the first 6 months of the year, import tonnage of all paper, board and converted products totaled 4.6 million tons, up 25.5 percent over the similar period in 1977. The value of imports, totaling $1.4 billion, was up by 25 percent over the first 6 months of 1977. Second quarter imports, climbing further, were up 16.5 percent over the first quarter total.", "Most of the paper and board imports are in the form of printing paper. Newsprint imports, which dropped in relative importance, still represent 85 percent of the total paper and board imports. In the first half of 1978, imports of newsprint, and uncoated and coated printing papers accounted for 91.5 percent of all paper and board products, with building paper and board accounting for an additional 5 percent.", "Newsprint imports which totaled 3.7 million tons in the January\u2013June period were up by 16.4 percent over the total recorded in the same period in 1977. Second quarter newsprint imports were up 14.8 percent over the first quarter figure. Uncoated printing papers, other than newsprint, totaled 346,000 tons in the first half of 1978 and showed a second quarter gain of 23 percent. Coated printing paper imports approached 140,000 tons in the first 6 months of 1978, and were up 11.8 percent in the second quarter. Imports of building paper and board, reflective of the strong demand engendered by heightened building activity in the United States totaled 250,200 tons, a 75 percent increase over last year's level for the same 6-month period.", "Exports Move Up in Second Quarter", "Export volume of paper, board and converted products totaled 942,000 tons in the second quarter, which represented a 13.9 percent increase over the depressed first quarter shipments to foreign markets. Overall, exports were up 6.6 percent in the first half of the year; however, year-to-year declines still were evident in the paper grades. As a result, exports of the primary paper and board grades were up only a modest 1.6 percent in the first half of the year despite a sharp gain (12.2 percent) in the second quarter.", "Exports of the primary paperboard products, which amounted to 1,155,000 tons for the first 6 months of 1978, were up 10.7 percent in the second quarter and 8.3 percent when compared to the first half of 1977. Linerboard trade, normally the key to the industry's export performance, finished the half year at a reported 804,000 tons, up 8.9 percent over the similar period in 1977 but below the past 10-year average. A firming woodpulp market, disrupted since 1975 by massive producer-held inventories and improving European economies, points toward improvement in second half linerboard exports.", "Exports of Special foodboard continued to grow, climbing 35.9 percent over the first quarter tonnage. First", "half exports of Special foodboard were reported to be 169,900 tons setting the stage for another record-breaking year. While markets are maturing for bleached boards in the United States, exports of this Commodity, destined for countries with changing modes of food distribution and climbing living standards, have grown at an average annual rate of 18.1 percent since 1967. Converted paper and board products, a relatively fast growing export segment over the past 5 years, moved up only modestly in the second quarter. However, for the half year, converted products totaled 168,000 tons, up 51.2 percent over the reported half-year figure for 1977.", "Prices Up Moderately", "Paper prices overall, as measured by the Producer Price Index (former Wholesale Price Index), rose a modest 4.2 percent in the January\u2013June period. Paperboard prices were up 4.4 percent and converted product prices were up only 2.9 percent during the 6-month period. Building board prices, directly influenced by the strong demand, were up 12.7 percent in the January\u2013June period. In comparison, average prices for all industrial commodities in the first half of 1978 rose 2.1 percent.", "COMMODITY TRENDS: SOLID WOOD PRODUCTS January-June 1977-78", "By David K. Henry", "Softwood Products", "Demand for softwood solid wood products was off to a brisk pace in the first half of 1978 as U.S. housing starts, on a seasonally adjusted annual basis for the second quarter of this year, was over the two million mark (a 2,114,000 average). This was an 11 percent increase over the same period in 1977. Actual starts of residential construction for the first 6 months showed 986,400 starts, an increase of 4.0 percent. Single family dwellings comprised 72 percent of the total housing starts, compared to 75 percent a year earlier. The percent of single family starts is a key indicator for solid wood product demand since more lumber and plywood are used in single family construction than in multiple unit construction. In general, common walls and use of substitute materials such as brick and block in multi-family construction reduce the amount of structural wood products used.", "Lumber", "For the first 6 months of 1978, production, shipments, and orders received of softwood lumber were running slightly less than the same period in 1977. Production of softwood lumber was less than half of one percent below the first half of 1977, while shipments were 1 percent less and orders received were about 2 1/2 percent less. The reduced levels of production and orders of softwood lumber during such a high rate of demand possibly reflect the severe winter weather over the first part of the year, reducing logging operations and construction activity, and the anticipation by lumber wholesalers that housing demand\u2014thus lumber demand\u2014will taper off by the end of 1978.", "Specifically, softwood lumber production in the southern pine region for the first 6 months of 1978 was essentially the same as in 1977; the Douglas fir region showed a 4.8 percent increase in production; the western pine region a 4.0 percent decrease; the California redwood region, a 6.3 percent decrease, and other softwood regions at virtually the same pace. The southern pine region produced 26 percent of the total softwood lumber for January\u2013June 1978; 30 percent for the Douglas fir region, 31 percent for the western pine region, and 7.3 percent for the California redwood region. Therefore, the Pacific Northwest continues to produce the majority of the softwood lumber needs for the domestic and export market. However, indications are that the direction of", "flow of softwood lumber from the Southern and Pacific Northwest-producing region are changing. Freight rates on the Nation's rail lines from the Pacific Northwest to the northeastern consuming regions are, according to industry sources, becoming cost prohibitive. The southern producing region (basically the southeastern States) has an increasing advantage in the freight proportion of the lumber costs to the northeastern wholesaler. Also, various sources indicate that the Pacific Northwest producers are directing sales to western markets and export. U.S. exports of softwood lumber to all countries for the first six months of 1978 were 703 million board feet, a 12 percent decrease from the same period last year. Japan and Canada were the two leading purchasers of U.S. softwood lumber, buying 203 and 193 million board feet, respectively. These two countries purchased 56 percent of U.S. lumber exports. Australian purchases ranked third at 68 million board feet and Italy ranked fourth at 58 million board feet. Douglas fir lumber was the major softwood lumber export item at 244 million board feet; hemlock was at 144 million board feet; southern pine at 68 million board feet; and spruce at 60 million board feet.", "Logs", "U.S. softwood log exports, primarily from the Pacific Northwest, were 11.4 percent greater for the first 6 months of 1978 compared to the like period in 1977. Total export volume of softwood logs was 1,718 million board feet. Japan purchased 78 percent of U.S. softwood log exports. The Republic of Korea (South Korea) increased its U.S. softwood log purchases by 250 percent in the first 6 months of 1978 over the same period in 1977, to 225 million board feet or 13 percent of the export volume. Industry sources indicate that Korea's purchases of U.S. softwood logs are ultimately consumed by (1) the domestic market, and (2) the export market, to either Europe or Japan. The lower wage rates of the Korean forest products industry allow these products to be exported competitively with the United States.", "Imports of U.S. softwood sawtimber logs were virtually negligible in comparison to consumption at 41 million board feet, for the first 6 months of 1978. Practically all U.S. imports of softwood logs come from Canada. Canada regulates the export of unprocessed softwood logs with the intent to export only softwood logs that are in excess supply of domestic demand. The United", "\nStates prohibits the export of softwood logs from Federal lands (basically National Forest lands), but does not prohibit export of logs from State and private lands. Softwood log exports have been controversial in the United States, especially during high domestic demand cycles.", "Lumber Imports", "Imports of softwood lumber, on the other hand, consistute a significant proportion of U.S. consumption of that item. For the first 6 months of 1978, Softwood lumber imports amounted to 5,578 million board feet, an increase of 12 percent over the same period last year. Canada continues to dominate the import share with 99 percent of total U.S. purchases of softwood lumber. In the first 6 months of 1978 imports accounted for 27 percent of apparent U.S. domestic consumption. For the first half of 1977, imports of softwood lumber accounted for 25 percent of apparent domestic consumption. The devaluation of the Canadian dollar, low Canadian raw material costs, and relatively cheap transportation, especially from Bri-tish Columbia to eastern U.S. markets, have helped the Canadian exporters market their softwood products in this country.", "Plywood", "Softwood plywood production for the first 6 months of 1978 was 10,157 million board feet (3/8-inch basis), a 2 percent increase over the like period in 1977. Shipments of softwood plywood ran slightly less, however, Orders received were 1 percent greater for the first 6 months of this year over the like period last year. Exports of softwood plywood of 176 million square feet were running slightly less than the volume exported by mid-year 1977. The major drop in total volume of softwood plywood exports from 1976 to 1977 of 60 percent was due in major part, to (1) the increase in domestic demand for softwood plywood in 1977-78, (2) the Canadian resolution of Labor disputes in their forest products industry, and (3) the devaluation of the Canadian dollar. Also, the strong market for U.S. plywood in Canada in 1976 quickly diminished in 1977. Imports of softwood plywood are virtually negligible as a part of domestic consumption at 18 million square feet for the first 6 months of this year, and represent less than one-half of one percent of the apparent domestic consumption of softwood plywood.", "Softwood Prices", "Softwood lumber Producers Price Index (PPI\u2014formerly Wholesale Price Index) increased 22 percent from", "June 1977 to June 1978, and increased 16 percent from December 1977 to June of this year. The relatively high price increases of lumber and plywood compared to the \u201call commodities\u201d index led to President Carter\u2019s remark in his April 11, 1978, anti-inflation message that directed the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Council on Environmental Quality to find ways to increase timber sales from Federal lands. Increased timber sales from National Forests would, hopefully, ease supply price pressures on lumber and wood products. Another issue that would potentially affect timber sales volume, is the Road less Area ", "Review ", "and Evaluation (RARE II). About 62 million acres of roadless and undeveloped National Forest land are being reviewed under RARE II for the completion of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The RARE II process of land-use planning should be completed by the end of 1978. The industry points to the 26.5 million acres of commerical forest land being reviewed under RARE II as a necessary timber source to meet the projected rising demand for timber products until the end of the century.", "Other softwood product PPI'S in June 1978 were millwork at 244.9, a 27 percent increase over June 1977; softwood plywood at 236.0, a 16 percent increase over June 1977; and softwood veneer at 249.1 (1971=100), a 36 percent increase over last year.", "The current housing boom was the key factor in price increases to above a 20 percent level in the 1-year period. However, the increasing cost of raw material (the softwood log) to the primary producers of softwood products over the past several years is also an important factor influencing price increases. For instance, U.S. Forest Service statistics show that Douglas fir peeler (used for veneer and eventually plywood) log prices increased on the average from 1971 to 1977 about 19 percent each year to around $300 per thousand board feet. In 1971, Douglas fir peeler logs were selling at $128 per thousand. Douglas fir sawtimber log prices showed an average annual increase of 23.4 percent from 1971 to 1977 or a total of 163.5 percent in the 7-year period. The average price of all grades of Douglas fir sawtimber logs in 1977 was about $227 per MBF.", "Prices quoted are for water and inland sales used in domestic consumption. Export sales have generally been at considerably higher prices than domestic sales. In 1977, the price differential between domestic and export log sales was about $85 per thousand board feet for Douglas fir peeler logs, due partly to the higher grade of peeler logs sold for export.", "Hardwoods", "Hardwood lumber production for the first 6 months of 1978 was 3,160 million board feet, about a 5 percent", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "Figure 1.

", "Source: Swedish Central Bureau of Statistics. ", "VENEZUELA'S MAJOR FORESTRY PROJECTS", "(Excerpted from American Embassy-Caracas Report)", "Summary", "Venezuela has begun a number of large forestry projects to satisfy the fiber requirements of that nation's pulp and paper Mills. Raw material needs are particularly acute with respect to secondary fibers for the paper and board industry, long-fibered pulp for newsprint, and softwood timber for use in the construction industry. The pulp and paper industry is heavily dependent on imports, with 83 percent of all pulp requirements being imported. As these projects reach maturity, opportunities for U.S. businessmen will arise in construction, consulting/engineering, and equipment sales.", "Because of current pulp, short fiber, and timber shortages, Venezuela has embarked on an ambitious planting/development program for Caribbean pine and eucalyptus in the southern Anzoategui and northern Monagas State areas, respectively. The objective is to convert the Sabanas into a gigantic forestry and industry complex capable of supporting several pulp Mills that would not only supply domestic needs but also provide valuable export income. The two major government agencies responsible for these developments are Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) and Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CNR).", "Uverito ", "Project ", "The Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "was begun in 1969 by Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana with the intention of planting 218 million trees on 150,000 hectares by 1985, in order to produce long fiber pulp-mainly for the production of newsprint. Long fiber pulp is currently imported at an annual rate of 80,000 tons. Caribbean pine (Hondurensis), imported from Guatemala and other Central American countries, is the type of tree being planted. To date, about 80 million trees have been planted on 110,000 acres, with an additional 110 million planned for 1984. Plans are being made to harvest trees for pulp production in 1984. Eventually, 4,000 hectares out of every 10,000 will be harvested for pulp, with the remainder being conserved for timber production (maturity: about 10 to 15 years). By 1986, CVG expects to reach the 4,000 hectare level, with an expected yield of 180 cubic meters per hectare. CVG will require forestry equipment and technical assistance for the extraction process.", "In preparation for the harvesting period, CVG has plans to build a pulp mill capable of producing 200,000 tons annually, which should be completed by the 1984 deadline. Decisions on outside equity participation and exact composition have yet to be made, but the mill will be separately managed from the rest of the forestry ", "proj", "ect, and probably will be structured in the manner of other CVG corporations such as SIDOR, VENALUM. and ALCASE. While a feasibility study had been made at the initial conception of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project, ", "it considered tropical woods rather than pines as the basic raw material. A probable timetable for Uverito development is: late 1978-79 for new feasibility studies; 1979-81 for decisions on equity participation; 1981-82 for start of construction; and 1984 for start-up of production.", "CONARE", "Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CONARE) was created in August 1975, with the mandate to take responsibility for Venezuela's forestry industry (excluding Uverito). Under Federal decree No. 1341 of December 16, 1975, CONARE was authorized to incorporate the private sector into Venezuela's forestry programs. While CONARE has several small experimental forests throughout the country, its major area of development is in South Anzoategui and Monagas States, on land owned by the National Agrarian Institute. Here CONARE has about 100,000 hectares which it plans to divide into seven huge blocks and to develop, in conjunction with its Venezuelan and foreign partners, a large Caribbean pine and eucalyptus plantation.", "Companies established by CONARE include: (1) Corporacion Forestal Guayamure, with an area of about 10,000 hectares of Caribbean pine; (2) Forestor, with an area of 75,000 hectares which will be planted to eucalyptus to support a 300,000 ton-year pulp mill; and (3) Corporacion Forestal Sipao S.A., which will plant 18,000 hectares of short-fibered eucalyptus.", "Other Projects", "Corporation Venezolana de Fomento is doing a feasibility study for a bagasse mill at Rio Turbio. Industry", "\nsources are skeptical of this project's success, in part due to water shortages in the area. A ", "project ", "to construct a short fiber mill in Central Portuguesa is also being considered. While no construction has begun, several firms have placed orders for its production.", "Equipment", "With harvesting periods due around 1984, and with initial experimental thinnings already started, the demand for forestry equipment should begin to increase. The manager of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "has already visited the United States to study equipment. The proximity of the United States, which facilitates maintenance, is an important competitive factor.", "In response to the upcoming increases in supply of raw materials there appears to be a new interest in investment in paper machines; several local firms are considering purchases of new machines in the near future. However, industry members are awaiting changes in Government price control policy before making large investments.", "Forestry studies have indicated the need for improved planting methods. Consequently, there should be new purchases of equipment to plant and maintain forests. A Georgia ", "company ", "has already sold quite a few of its semiautomatic transplanters to CONARE, Uverito, and Manpa paper ", "company. ", "Centralized Management", "There has been considerable discussion concerning the placing of Venezuela's forest and pulp industry under one government coordinating agency. Since most of the forestry projects are located in the same area (southern Anzoategui, Monagas, and Uverito) coordination between the entities developing these areas will be required for long-term investments such as pulp Mills. Plans call for a ministerial level commission to coordinate forestry development between Uverito, CONARE, and the private sector. It is reported that the Government is considering consolidating the industry under CONARE'S manageIn ent.", "RECENT DEVELOPMENTS", "1. Newsprint Mill Planned in Australia", "Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd. (ANM) has announced a go-ahead for construction of a A$155 million newsprint mill at Albury, in New South Wales. The New South Wales Government had encouraged the construction of the mill with various incentives, including housing, payroll tax rebates, machinery subsidies, employee training subsidies, and financial assistance in locating key perSonnel.", "The mill will eventually have the capacity to produce 180,000 tons of newsprint a year, raising ANM'S total annual capacity to more than 380,000 tons. More than 90 percent of the raw material furnished would be thermomechanical pulp produced at the mill; the remainder will be imported in the form of bleached sulfate pulp. About 450,000 cubic meters-year of radiata pine is available from about 53,000 hectares of State-owned forest in the area around Albury. ANM presently operates a newsprint mill in Tasmania, and the combined production from both Mills would satisfy about 70 percent of Australia's annual newsprint consumption. This will reduce the country's dependence on imported newsprint\u2014 about 200,000 tons annually, mainly from New ", "Zealand ", "and Canada\u2014and will save about A$70 million in foreign exchange.", "The planning and design of the mill is well under way, and the selection of equipment has reached an advanced", "stage. The ", "project, ", "which is due for completion in 1981, has been welcomed by state and local governments of New South Wales, although there have been some protests from a wide range of community groups, following environmental and economic impact studies on the proposed mill. The ", "project ", "will provide employment for about 800 people during the construction phase, and 650 people when in actual operation. It has been reported that about A-100 million will be borrowed from domestic sources for the ", "project ", "by ANM, with additional capital sought overseas.", "The decision by ANM to construct the new mill at Albury could put the ", "company ", "in direct competition with one of its major shareholders, New Zealand's Tasman Pulp and Paper Co.

Raja Garuda Mas is located at Besitong in North Sumatra province near the border with Aceh. Established in 1974, the firm began operations with only a plywood mill but, in the intervening years, has added two sawmill units and a plant which produces wood-cement panels for prefabricated houses.", "In addition to plywood for construction purposes, the facility also turns out decorative veneer for furniture. Most of the equipment in the plywood plant is of Japanese manufacture though there were two large peelers from a U.S. manufacturer, Production Machinery Inc. of Portland, Oregon. Capacity of the plywood operation is 12,000-15,000 sheets (measuring four feet by eight feet, with a thickness of four millimeters) per day. The plant operates 24 hours per day with the exception of 2 days each month when shut down for maintenance.", "Garuda Mas' sawmill units were set up in 1977 to", "19", "comply with an Indonesian Government regulation compelling holders of timber concessions to process logs locally. As at the plywood facility, most of the equipment was imported from Japan.", "Also in 1977, the ", "company ", "began to manufacture wood-cement panels using as raw material the waste from its plywood and sawmill operations. Wood waste is chipped in a hammer mill, and is washed and mixed with cement to produce panels measuring one meter by twenty centimeters, with a thickness of five centimeters. These panels are used principally in the construction of low-cost, prefabricated houses. At present Garuda Mas produces about 3,000 panels per day.", "Garuda Mas obtains its timber from large concessions controlled by the firm in Aceh province, near the town of Idi. Logs are floated down the Besitong River to the plant site on the river bank. The river also serves as the company's inlet for imported raw materials, which are brought in by barge, mainly from Singapore. Most of the finished products are trucked to Medan's port, Belawan, for shipment to Java or abroad.", "P.T. Lontar Papyrus Paper Industry", "Established in 1974, Lontar Papyrus Paper Industry is situated in Aceh province, about twenty kilometers from the town of Langsa. The sole owner of the facility is a Medan resident of Chinese descent. Except for two technicians from Taiwan, the plant is staffed by local Indonesians. Much of the plant's equipment, which appears quite modern, is from Taiwan, though there is some from Japan and West Germany as well. Raw material, in the form of boxed pulp, is imported from the Scandinavian countries, Canada and the United States. Originally, the firm had hoped to procure most of its raw material locally but it discovered that it could obtain only enough wood to operate its chippers at 20 percent capacity.

", "VENEZUELA'S MAJOR FORESTRY PROJECTS", "(Excerpted from American Embassy-Caracas Report)", "Summary", "Venezuela has begun a number of large forestry projects to satisfy the fiber requirements of that nation's pulp and paper Mills. Raw material needs are particularly acute with respect to secondary fibers for the paper and board industry, long-fibered pulp for newsprint, and softwood timber for use in the construction industry. The pulp and paper industry is heavily dependent on imports, with 83 percent of all pulp requirements being imported. As these projects reach maturity, opportunities for U.S. businessmen will arise in construction, consulting/engineering, and equipment sales.", "Because of current pulp, short fiber, and timber shortages, Venezuela has embarked on an ambitious planting/development program for Caribbean pine and eucalyptus in the southern Anzoategui and northern Monagas State areas, respectively. The objective is to convert the Sabanas into a gigantic forestry and industry complex capable of supporting several pulp Mills that would not only supply domestic needs but also provide valuable export income. The two major government agencies responsible for these developments are Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) and Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CNR).", "Uverito ", "Project ", "The Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "was begun in 1969 by Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana with the intention of planting 218 million trees on 150,000 hectares by 1985, in order to produce long fiber pulp-mainly for the production of newsprint. Long fiber pulp is currently imported at an annual rate of 80,000 tons. Caribbean pine (Hondurensis), imported from Guatemala and other Central American countries, is the type of tree being planted. To date, about 80 million trees have been planted on 110,000 acres, with an additional 110 million planned for 1984. Plans are being made to harvest trees for pulp production in 1984. Eventually, 4,000 hectares out of every 10,000 will be harvested for pulp, with the remainder being conserved for timber production (maturity: about 10 to 15 years). By 1986, CVG expects to reach the 4,000 hectare level, with an expected yield of 180 cubic meters per hectare. CVG will require forestry equipment and technical assistance for the extraction process.", "In preparation for the harvesting period, CVG has plans to build a pulp mill capable of producing 200,000 tons annually, which should be completed by the 1984 deadline. Decisions on outside equity participation and exact composition have yet to be made, but the mill will be separately managed from the rest of the forestry ", "proj", "ect, and probably will be structured in the manner of other CVG corporations such as SIDOR, VENALUM. and ALCASE. While a feasibility study had been made at the initial conception of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project, ", "it considered tropical woods rather than pines as the basic raw material. A probable timetable for Uverito development is: late 1978-79 for new feasibility studies; 1979-81 for decisions on equity participation; 1981-82 for start of construction; and 1984 for start-up of production.", "CONARE", "Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CONARE) was created in August 1975, with the mandate to take responsibility for Venezuela's forestry industry (excluding Uverito). Under Federal decree No. 1341 of December 16, 1975, CONARE was authorized to incorporate the private sector into Venezuela's forestry programs. While CONARE has several small experimental forests throughout the country, its major area of development is in South Anzoategui and Monagas States, on land owned by the National Agrarian Institute. Here CONARE has about 100,000 hectares which it plans to divide into seven huge blocks and to develop, in conjunction with its Venezuelan and foreign partners, a large Caribbean pine and eucalyptus plantation.", "Companies established by CONARE include: (1) Corporacion Forestal Guayamure, with an area of about 10,000 hectares of Caribbean pine; (2) Forestor, with an area of 75,000 hectares which will be planted to eucalyptus to support a 300,000 ton-year pulp mill; and (3) Corporacion Forestal Sipao S.A., which will plant 18,000 hectares of short-fibered eucalyptus.", "Other Projects", "Corporation Venezolana de Fomento is doing a feasibility study for a bagasse mill at Rio Turbio. Industry", "\nsources are skeptical of this project's success, in part due to water shortages in the area. A ", "project ", "to construct a short fiber mill in Central Portuguesa is also being considered. While no construction has begun, several firms have placed orders for its production.", "Equipment", "With harvesting periods due around 1984, and with initial experimental thinnings already started, the demand for forestry equipment should begin to increase. The manager of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "has already visited the United States to study equipment. The proximity of the United States, which facilitates maintenance, is an important competitive factor.", "In response to the upcoming increases in supply of raw materials there appears to be a new interest in investment in paper machines; several local firms are considering purchases of new machines in the near future. However, industry members are awaiting changes in Government price control policy before making large investments.", "Forestry studies have indicated the need for improved planting methods. Consequently, there should be new purchases of equipment to plant and maintain forests. A Georgia ", "company ", "has already sold quite a few of its semiautomatic transplanters to CONARE, Uverito, and Manpa paper ", "company. ", "Centralized Management", "There has been considerable discussion concerning the placing of Venezuela's forest and pulp industry under one government coordinating agency. Since most of the forestry projects are located in the same area (southern Anzoategui, Monagas, and Uverito) coordination between the entities developing these areas will be required for long-term investments such as pulp Mills. Plans call for a ministerial level commission to coordinate forestry development between Uverito, CONARE, and the private sector. It is reported that the Government is considering consolidating the industry under CONARE'S manageIn ent.", "RECENT DEVELOPMENTS", "1. Newsprint Mill Planned in Australia", "Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd. (ANM) has announced a go-ahead for construction of a A$155 million newsprint mill at Albury, in New South Wales. The New South Wales Government had encouraged the construction of the mill with various incentives, including housing, payroll tax rebates, machinery subsidies, employee training subsidies, and financial assistance in locating key perSonnel.", "The mill will eventually have the capacity to produce 180,000 tons of newsprint a year, raising ANM'S total annual capacity to more than 380,000 tons. More than 90 percent of the raw material furnished would be thermomechanical pulp produced at the mill; the remainder will be imported in the form of bleached sulfate pulp. About 450,000 cubic meters-year of radiata pine is available from about 53,000 hectares of State-owned forest in the area around Albury. ANM presently operates a newsprint mill in Tasmania, and the combined production from both Mills would satisfy about 70 percent of Australia's annual newsprint consumption. This will reduce the country's dependence on imported newsprint\u2014 about 200,000 tons annually, mainly from New ", "Zealand ", "and Canada\u2014and will save about A$70 million in foreign exchange.", "The planning and design of the mill is well under way, and the selection of equipment has reached an advanced", "stage. The ", "project, ", "which is due for completion in 1981, has been welcomed by state and local governments of New South Wales, although there have been some protests from a wide range of community groups, following environmental and economic impact studies on the proposed mill. The ", "project ", "will provide employment for about 800 people during the construction phase, and 650 people when in actual operation. It has been reported that about A-100 million will be borrowed from domestic sources for the ", "project ", "by ANM, with additional capital sought overseas.", "The decision by ANM to construct the new mill at Albury could put the ", "company ", "in direct competition with one of its major shareholders, New Zealand's Tasman Pulp and Paper Co.

Raja Garuda Mas is located at Besitong in North Sumatra province near the border with Aceh. Established in 1974, the firm began operations with only a plywood mill but, in the intervening years, has added two sawmill units and a plant which produces wood-cement panels for prefabricated houses.", "In addition to plywood for construction purposes, the facility also turns out decorative veneer for furniture. Most of the equipment in the plywood plant is of Japanese manufacture though there were two large peelers from a U.S. manufacturer, Production Machinery Inc. of Portland, Oregon. Capacity of the plywood operation is 12,000-15,000 sheets (measuring four feet by eight feet, with a thickness of four millimeters) per day. The plant operates 24 hours per day with the exception of 2 days each month when shut down for maintenance.", "Garuda Mas' sawmill units were set up in 1977 to", "19", "comply with an Indonesian Government regulation compelling holders of timber concessions to process logs locally. As at the plywood facility, most of the equipment was imported from Japan.", "Also in 1977, the ", "company ", "began to manufacture wood-cement panels using as raw material the waste from its plywood and sawmill operations. Wood waste is chipped in a hammer mill, and is washed and mixed with cement to produce panels measuring one meter by twenty centimeters, with a thickness of five centimeters. These panels are used principally in the construction of low-cost, prefabricated houses. At present Garuda Mas produces about 3,000 panels per day.", "Garuda Mas obtains its timber from large concessions controlled by the firm in Aceh province, near the town of Idi. Logs are floated down the Besitong River to the plant site on the river bank. The river also serves as the company's inlet for imported raw materials, which are brought in by barge, mainly from Singapore. Most of the finished products are trucked to Medan's port, Belawan, for shipment to Java or abroad.", "P.T. Lontar Papyrus Paper Industry", "Established in 1974, Lontar Papyrus Paper Industry is situated in Aceh province, about twenty kilometers from the town of Langsa. The sole owner of the facility is a Medan resident of Chinese descent. Except for two technicians from Taiwan, the plant is staffed by local Indonesians. Much of the plant's equipment, which appears quite modern, is from Taiwan, though there is some from Japan and West Germany as well. Raw material, in the form of boxed pulp, is imported from the Scandinavian countries, Canada and the United States.

", "VENEZUELA'S MAJOR FORESTRY PROJECTS", "(Excerpted from American Embassy-Caracas Report)", "Summary", "Venezuela has begun a number of large forestry projects to satisfy the fiber requirements of that nation's pulp and paper Mills. Raw material needs are particularly acute with respect to secondary fibers for the paper and board industry, long-fibered pulp for newsprint, and softwood timber for use in the construction industry. The pulp and paper industry is heavily dependent on imports, with 83 percent of all pulp requirements being imported. As these projects reach maturity, opportunities for U.S. businessmen will arise in construction, consulting/engineering, and equipment sales.", "Because of current pulp, short fiber, and timber shortages, Venezuela has embarked on an ambitious planting/development program for Caribbean pine and eucalyptus in the southern Anzoategui and northern Monagas State areas, respectively. The objective is to convert the Sabanas into a gigantic forestry and industry complex capable of supporting several pulp Mills that would not only supply domestic needs but also provide valuable export income. The two major government agencies responsible for these developments are Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) and Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CNR).", "Uverito ", "Project ", "The Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "was begun in 1969 by Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana with the intention of planting 218 million trees on 150,000 hectares by 1985, in order to produce long fiber pulp-mainly for the production of newsprint. Long fiber pulp is currently imported at an annual rate of 80,000 tons. Caribbean pine (Hondurensis), imported from Guatemala and other Central American countries, is the type of tree being planted. To date, about 80 million trees have been planted on 110,000 acres, with an additional 110 million planned for 1984. Plans are being made to harvest trees for pulp production in 1984. Eventually, 4,000 hectares out of every 10,000 will be harvested for pulp, with the remainder being conserved for timber production (maturity: about 10 to 15 years). By 1986, CVG expects to reach the 4,000 hectare level, with an expected yield of 180 cubic meters per hectare. CVG will require forestry equipment and technical assistance for the extraction process.", "In preparation for the harvesting period, CVG has plans to build a pulp mill capable of producing 200,000 tons annually, which should be completed by the 1984 deadline. Decisions on outside equity participation and exact composition have yet to be made, but the mill will be separately managed from the rest of the forestry ", "proj", "ect, and probably will be structured in the manner of other CVG corporations such as SIDOR, VENALUM. and ALCASE. While a feasibility study had been made at the initial conception of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project, ", "it considered tropical woods rather than pines as the basic raw material. A probable timetable for Uverito development is: late 1978-79 for new feasibility studies; 1979-81 for decisions on equity participation; 1981-82 for start of construction; and 1984 for start-up of production.", "CONARE", "Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CONARE) was created in August 1975, with the mandate to take responsibility for Venezuela's forestry industry (excluding Uverito). Under Federal decree No. 1341 of December 16, 1975, CONARE was authorized to incorporate the private sector into Venezuela's forestry programs. While CONARE has several small experimental forests throughout the country, its major area of development is in South Anzoategui and Monagas States, on land owned by the National Agrarian Institute. Here CONARE has about 100,000 hectares which it plans to divide into seven huge blocks and to develop, in conjunction with its Venezuelan and foreign partners, a large Caribbean pine and eucalyptus plantation.", "Companies established by CONARE include: (1) Corporacion Forestal Guayamure, with an area of about 10,000 hectares of Caribbean pine; (2) Forestor, with an area of 75,000 hectares which will be planted to eucalyptus to support a 300,000 ton-year pulp mill; and (3) Corporacion Forestal Sipao S.A., which will plant 18,000 hectares of short-fibered eucalyptus.", "Other Projects", "Corporation Venezolana de Fomento is doing a feasibility study for a bagasse mill at Rio Turbio. Industry", "\nsources are skeptical of this project's success, in part due to water shortages in the area. A ", "project ", "to construct a short fiber mill in Central Portuguesa is also being considered. While no construction has begun, several firms have placed orders for its production.", "Equipment", "With harvesting periods due around 1984, and with initial experimental thinnings already started, the demand for forestry equipment should begin to increase. The manager of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "has already visited the United States to study equipment. The proximity of the United States, which facilitates maintenance, is an important competitive factor.", "In response to the upcoming increases in supply of raw materials there appears to be a new interest in investment in paper machines; several local firms are considering purchases of new machines in the near future. However, industry members are awaiting changes in Government price control policy before making large investments.", "Forestry studies have indicated the need for improved planting methods. Consequently, there should be new purchases of equipment to plant and maintain forests. A Georgia ", "company ", "has already sold quite a few of its semiautomatic transplanters to CONARE, Uverito, and Manpa paper ", "company. ", "Centralized Management", "There has been considerable discussion concerning the placing of Venezuela's forest and pulp industry under one government coordinating agency. Since most of the forestry projects are located in the same area (southern Anzoategui, Monagas, and Uverito) coordination between the entities developing these areas will be required for long-term investments such as pulp Mills. Plans call for a ministerial level commission to coordinate forestry development between Uverito, CONARE, and the private sector. It is reported that the Government is considering consolidating the industry under CONARE'S manageIn ent.", "RECENT DEVELOPMENTS", "1. Newsprint Mill Planned in Australia", "Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd. (ANM) has announced a go-ahead for construction of a A$155 million newsprint mill at Albury, in New South Wales. The New South Wales Government had encouraged the construction of the mill with various incentives, including housing, payroll tax rebates, machinery subsidies, employee training subsidies, and financial assistance in locating key perSonnel.", "The mill will eventually have the capacity to produce 180,000 tons of newsprint a year, raising ANM'S total annual capacity to more than 380,000 tons. More than 90 percent of the raw material furnished would be thermomechanical pulp produced at the mill; the remainder will be imported in the form of bleached sulfate pulp. About 450,000 cubic meters-year of radiata pine is available from about 53,000 hectares of State-owned forest in the area around Albury. ANM presently operates a newsprint mill in Tasmania, and the combined production from both Mills would satisfy about 70 percent of Australia's annual newsprint consumption. This will reduce the country's dependence on imported newsprint\u2014 about 200,000 tons annually, mainly from New ", "Zealand ", "and Canada\u2014and will save about A$70 million in foreign exchange.", "The planning and design of the mill is well under way, and the selection of equipment has reached an advanced", "stage. The ", "project, ", "which is due for completion in 1981, has been welcomed by state and local governments of New South Wales, although there have been some protests from a wide range of community groups, following environmental and economic impact studies on the proposed mill. The ", "project ", "will provide employment for about 800 people during the construction phase, and 650 people when in actual operation. It has been reported that about A-100 million will be borrowed from domestic sources for the ", "project ", "by ANM, with additional capital sought overseas.", "The decision by ANM to construct the new mill at Albury could put the ", "company ", "in direct competition with one of its major shareholders, New Zealand's Tasman Pulp and Paper Co.

Raja Garuda Mas is located at Besitong in North Sumatra province near the border with Aceh. Established in 1974, the firm began operations with only a plywood mill but, in the intervening years, has added two sawmill units and a plant which produces wood-cement panels for prefabricated houses.", "In addition to plywood for construction purposes, the facility also turns out decorative veneer for furniture. Most of the equipment in the plywood plant is of Japanese manufacture though there were two large peelers from a U.S. manufacturer, Production Machinery Inc. of Portland, Oregon. Capacity of the plywood operation is 12,000-15,000 sheets (measuring four feet by eight feet, with a thickness of four millimeters) per day. The plant operates 24 hours per day with the exception of 2 days each month when shut down for maintenance.", "Garuda Mas' sawmill units were set up in 1977 to", "19", "comply with an Indonesian Government regulation compelling holders of timber concessions to process logs locally. As at the plywood facility, most of the equipment was imported from Japan.", "Also in 1977, the ", "company ", "began to manufacture wood-cement panels using as raw material the waste from its plywood and sawmill operations. Wood waste is chipped in a hammer mill, and is washed and mixed with cement to produce panels measuring one meter by twenty centimeters, with a thickness of five centimeters. These panels are used principally in the construction of low-cost, prefabricated houses. At present Garuda Mas produces about 3,000 panels per day.", "Garuda Mas obtains its timber from large concessions controlled by the firm in Aceh province, near the town of Idi. Logs are floated down the Besitong River to the plant site on the river bank. The river also serves as the company's inlet for imported raw materials, which are brought in by barge, mainly from Singapore. Most of the finished products are trucked to Medan's port, Belawan, for shipment to Java or abroad.", "P.T. Lontar Papyrus Paper Industry", "Established in 1974, Lontar Papyrus Paper Industry is situated in Aceh province, about twenty kilometers from the town of Langsa. The sole owner of the facility is a Medan resident of Chinese descent. Except for two technicians from Taiwan, the plant is staffed by local Indonesians. Much of the plant's equipment, which appears quite modern, is from Taiwan, though there is some from Japan and West Germany as well. Raw material, in the form of boxed pulp, is imported from the Scandinavian countries, Canada and the United States. Originally, the firm had hoped to procure most of its raw material locally but it discovered that it could obtain only enough wood to operate its chippers at 20 percent capacity. The ", "company ", "now hopes to arrange with one or more local timber companies to obtain the waste wood from logging operations for use in paper production.

A large supply is available and just waiting for improved demand and more attractive prices to draw it out.", "Woodpulp", "According to industry producer and market sources, the world woodpulp excess inventories, particularly in Swedish pulp export Mills, was drawn down close to normal levels of 1.0 to 1.5 million metric tons by the end of June, from a high of almost 2.9 million metric tons in December 1977. This was accomplished through aggressive market development and competitive pricing by the world market pulp producers. In the soft world market and aggressive selling atmosphere in the first half of the year, U.S. export market pulp lost some ground from volumes shipped during January\u2013June 1977\u20131.306 million short tons compared with 1.378 million short tons of exports (table S-14). Pulp exports, however, are only a small part (5 percent) of total U.S. pulp production. Market pulp Mills, operating at about 96 percent of capacity during January\u2013June according to the American Paper Institute (API), compared with a 94 percent operating rate during the 1977 period, funneled more of their pulps toward the domstic paper, paperboard and allied products Mills.", "Total woodpulp production of captive, or integrated and market pulp Mills is reported at 24 million tons for the first 6 months of 1978, compared with 23.9 million tons for the 1977 period (table S-3). These data, however, are incomplete because the date covering miscellaneous \u201cother\u201d grades of pulp, including defibrated, exploded, screenings and related wood fibers, are not available. The final pulp production figure will probably approach 25.5 million tons for January\u2013June 1977. On an annual basis, pulp production would approximate 51.3 million tons for 1978; up from an estimated 50 plus million tons for 1977, and from 48.8 million tons for 1976. Thus, the pulp industry has been producing to meet a slowly improving demand for its product. Producer inventory data are not yet available from the Bureau of the Census; but API data indicate no inventory building at the pulp Mills. Pulp inventories at the converting Mills also show essentially no change from 1977 levels (table S-4, table S-5).", "The leading pulp grades in demand in both domestic and export markets continue to be the bleached and unbleached sulfates (table S-3, table S-14). The total of all sulfate pulp grades, at 18.1 million tons for the first 6 months, was 500,000 tons or 2.8 percent over 1977 sixmonth figures. This tonnage also continues, as in 1977, to represent nearly 75 percent of the total reported 24.0 million tons of pulp production. Production of groundwood grades, including growing volumes of thermomechanical pulps, decreased from 2.3 million tons in the 1977 period to 2.1 million tons for January-June 1978. Semi-chemical pulp production also Fell slightly, from 2.1 million tons to 2.0 million tons for 1978. The production of corrugating medium, based on this pulp, Fell; while the use of wastepapers in a combination furnished medium increased (table S-5). This increased use of wastepaper in combination medium furnishes, especially old corrugated, is reflected in the wastepaper consumption data, by grade (table S-2). Old corrugated consumption at the user Mills, at 2.5 million tons, grew 460,000 tons or 17 percent over 1977 six-month consumption figures.", "The production of Special alpha and dissolving pulps dropped slightly from 1977 figures (table S-3). This is reflected in the 8 percent reduced consumption of those grades (table S-5) at the non-paper Mills, where producers of rayon fibers, cellophane and related chemical-converted pulp-based products are being steadily challenged in the market by other man-made fibers, filaments and films. The reduction of Special alpha and dissolving pulp production was also influenced by a drop in exports of these grades from 413,000 tons in January\u2013June 1977 to 403,000 for the 1978 period: a drop of 2.4 percent in exports (table S-14).", "The total picture, however, for the pulp producers during January\u2013June 1978 has been one of some improvement. The estimated final 1978 pulp production figure, at 51.3 million tons, will be an all-time record high; close to 2.5 percent above 1977 production. This improvement is geared to the 2.7 percent growth in paper and board production (table S-6).", "Paper and Board", "Preliminary data on paper and board apparent consumption (production + imports - exports) sets the quantity at 34.5 million tons for the January\u2013June 1978 period, a record rate. The second quarter rate of 16.8 million tons was 5.3 percent greater than that reported for the first quarter. The relationship of consumption to real GNP in 1978 (a commonly used measure) exceeds the norm and introduces the possibility of inventory accumulation as a factor for the variance. Inventories May have been built as", "\na hedge against possible paper industry strikes. Growing demand, stemming from the second quarter upturn in the U.S. economy as well as buying by offshore economies, provided added impetus to the 1978 growth of paper and board production. As reported by the Bureau of the Census, U.S. paper and board output in the second quarter totaled 16.3 million tons, a gain of 5.3 percent over the first quarter figure. For the half year, production equalled 30.8 million tons, 3.5 percent higher than the comparable year-ago level. As published by the American Paper Institute, the capacity utilization rates for paper Mills averaged 93.4 percent in the first 6 months of 1978 while those for paperboard Mills averaged 91.9 percent in the same period. Capacity utilization rates in the comparable period a year ago averaged 91.7 percent and 91.1 percent, respectively. Production of the paper grades, which amounted to 7.4 million tons in the second quarter, was up 2.3 percent over the first quarter figure and totaled 14.6 million tons for the first 6 months of the year, a 5.9 percent increase over the comparable 1977 period. Reflecting sharp gains in the nondurables sector and a pickup in export trade, the packaging-oriented paperboard segment showed a ", "7.7 ", "percent favorable quarter-to-quarter change and totaled 14.3 million tons in the January\u2013June period. Since the growth pattern emulated that shown in 1977, there was only a small improvement in the comparative 1977-78 half-year totals. Production of the building paper and board components, reflecting the continued high level of construction activity, climbed 8.9 percent higher in the second quarter and amounted to 2.8 million tons for the first half of 1978, a 4.9 percent increase over the first 6 months of 1977. In the paper sector, year-to-year improvements were evident in production of virtually all grades of paper but continued to be centered mainly in the printing and writing papers, which are currently reflecting the expanding demand from the burgeoning magazine industry and continuing growth in overall advertising. As a group, printing and writing paper represents the bulk of all paper output, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total paper output. Production of these papers was up 8.5 percent in the first half of 1978 compared with the similar period in 1977. The other two major paper grade sectors, tissues and coarse papers were up 3.1 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. Preliminary reports on second quarter production of some paper grades such as newsprint, coated two-sides printing papers, bristols, and the bag and sack papers, indicated lower second quarter output. Paperboard production finished the second quarter on the upbeat with a notable trend in the quickening tempo of linerboard production. Production of linerboard, the bedrock for the industry, increased 6.6 percent in the", "second quarter and totaled 6.8 million tons for the half year. Annualized, the second quarter rate would represent record production levels. Output of the combination paperboard grades, which use wastepaper as the major fiber source, moved up in the second quarter but finished the half year only 1.6 percent higher than the same period a year ago. Production of the bleached paperboard grades showed a comparative year-to-year decline of 14 percent as a strong second quarter performance, particularly in milk carton stock, was unable to offset a poor first quarter output and a similar strong second quarter showing a year ago. Second quarter production of the building paper and board grades was 8.7 percent higher than the first quarter total. Output of building papers, amounting to 1,006 thousand tons, represented a 13.8 percent improvement over the comparable 6-month period in 1977.", "Imports Up Markedly", "Aside from higher newsprint imports, which tradi-tionally amount to more than 60 percent of the total U.S. requirement of newsprint, imports in the past 2 years have been expanded because of higher domestic demand for printing papers, particularly coated lightweight magazine paper which is in tight supply in the United States. For the first 6 months of the year, import tonnage of all paper, board and converted products totaled 4.6 million tons, up 25.5 percent over the similar period in 1977. The value of imports, totaling $1.4 billion, was up by 25 percent over the first 6 months of 1977. Second quarter imports, climbing further, were up 16.5 percent over the first quarter total.", "Most of the paper and board imports are in the form of printing paper. Newsprint imports, which dropped in relative importance, still represent 85 percent of the total paper and board imports. In the first half of 1978, imports of newsprint, and uncoated and coated printing papers accounted for 91.5 percent of all paper and board products, with building paper and board accounting for an additional 5 percent.", "Newsprint imports which totaled 3.7 million tons in the January\u2013June period were up by 16.4 percent over the total recorded in the same period in 1977. Second quarter newsprint imports were up 14.8 percent over the first quarter figure. Uncoated printing papers, other than newsprint, totaled 346,000 tons in the first half of 1978 and showed a second quarter gain of 23 percent. Coated printing paper imports approached 140,000 tons in the first 6 months of 1978, and were up 11.8 percent in the second quarter. Imports of building paper and board, reflective of the strong demand engendered by heightened building activity in the United States totaled 250,200 tons, a 75 percent increase over last year's level for the same 6-month period.", "Exports Move Up in Second Quarter", "Export volume of paper, board and converted products totaled 942,000 tons in the second quarter, which represented a 13.9 percent increase over the depressed first quarter shipments to foreign markets. Overall, exports were up 6.6 percent in the first half of the year; however, year-to-year declines still were evident in the paper grades. As a result, exports of the primary paper and board grades were up only a modest 1.6 percent in the first half of the year despite a sharp gain (12.2 percent) in the second quarter.", "Exports of the primary paperboard products, which amounted to 1,155,000 tons for the first 6 months of 1978, were up 10.7 percent in the second quarter and 8.3 percent when compared to the first half of 1977. Linerboard trade, normally the key to the industry's export performance, finished the half year at a reported 804,000 tons, up 8.9 percent over the similar period in 1977 but below the past 10-year average. A firming woodpulp market, disrupted since 1975 by massive producer-held inventories and improving European economies, points toward improvement in second half linerboard exports.", "Exports of Special foodboard continued to grow, climbing 35.9 percent over the first quarter tonnage. First", "half exports of Special foodboard were reported to be 169,900 tons setting the stage for another record-breaking year. While markets are maturing for bleached boards in the United States, exports of this Commodity, destined for countries with changing modes of food distribution and climbing living standards, have grown at an average annual rate of 18.1 percent since 1967. Converted paper and board products, a relatively fast growing export segment over the past 5 years, moved up only modestly in the second quarter. However, for the half year, converted products totaled 168,000 tons, up 51.2 percent over the reported half-year figure for 1977.", "Prices Up Moderately", "Paper prices overall, as measured by the Producer Price Index (former Wholesale Price Index), rose a modest 4.2 percent in the January\u2013June period. Paperboard prices were up 4.4 percent and converted product prices were up only 2.9 percent during the 6-month period. Building board prices, directly influenced by the strong demand, were up 12.7 percent in the January\u2013June period. In comparison, average prices for all industrial commodities in the first half of 1978 rose 2.1 percent.", "COMMODITY TRENDS: SOLID WOOD PRODUCTS January-June 1977-78", "By David K. Henry", "Softwood Products", "Demand for softwood solid wood products was off to a brisk pace in the first half of 1978 as U.S. housing starts, on a seasonally adjusted annual basis for the second quarter of this year, was over the two million mark (a 2,114,000 average). This was an 11 percent increase over the same period in 1977. Actual starts of residential construction for the first 6 months showed 986,400 starts, an increase of 4.0 percent. Single family dwellings comprised 72 percent of the total housing starts, compared to 75 percent a year earlier. The percent of single family starts is a key indicator for solid wood product demand since more lumber and plywood are used in single family construction than in multiple unit construction. In general, common walls and use of substitute materials such as brick and block in multi-family construction reduce the amount of structural wood products used.", "Lumber", "For the first 6 months of 1978, production, shipments, and orders received of softwood lumber were running slightly less than the same period in 1977. Production of softwood lumber was less than half of one percent below the first half of 1977, while shipments were 1 percent less and orders received were about 2 1/2 percent less. The reduced levels of production and orders of softwood lumber during such a high rate of demand possibly reflect the severe winter weather over the first part of the year, reducing logging operations and construction activity, and the anticipation by lumber wholesalers that housing demand\u2014thus lumber demand\u2014will taper off by the end of 1978.", "Specifically, softwood lumber production in the southern pine region for the first 6 months of 1978 was essentially the same as in 1977; the Douglas fir region showed a 4.8 percent increase in production; the western pine region a 4.0 percent decrease; the California redwood region, a 6.3 percent decrease, and other softwood regions at virtually the same pace. The southern pine region produced 26 percent of the total softwood lumber for January\u2013June 1978; 30 percent for the Douglas fir region, 31 percent for the western pine region, and 7.3 percent for the California redwood region. Therefore, the Pacific Northwest continues to produce the majority of the softwood lumber needs for the domestic and export market. However, indications are that the direction of", "flow of softwood lumber from the Southern and Pacific Northwest-producing region are changing. Freight rates on the Nation's rail lines from the Pacific Northwest to the northeastern consuming regions are, according to industry sources, becoming cost prohibitive. The southern producing region (basically the southeastern States) has an increasing advantage in the freight proportion of the lumber costs to the northeastern wholesaler. Also, various sources indicate that the Pacific Northwest producers are directing sales to western markets and export. U.S. exports of softwood lumber to all countries for the first six months of 1978 were 703 million board feet, a 12 percent decrease from the same period last year. Japan and Canada were the two leading purchasers of U.S. softwood lumber, buying 203 and 193 million board feet, respectively. These two countries purchased 56 percent of U.S. lumber exports. Australian purchases ranked third at 68 million board feet and Italy ranked fourth at 58 million board feet. Douglas fir lumber was the major softwood lumber export item at 244 million board feet; hemlock was at 144 million board feet; southern pine at 68 million board feet; and spruce at 60 million board feet.", "Logs", "U.S. softwood log exports, primarily from the Pacific Northwest, were 11.4 percent greater for the first 6 months of 1978 compared to the like period in 1977. Total export volume of softwood logs was 1,718 million board feet. Japan purchased 78 percent of U.S. softwood log exports. The Republic of Korea (South Korea) increased its U.S. softwood log purchases by 250 percent in the first 6 months of 1978 over the same period in 1977, to 225 million board feet or 13 percent of the export volume. Industry sources indicate that Korea's purchases of U.S. softwood logs are ultimately consumed by (1) the domestic market, and (2) the export market, to either Europe or Japan. The lower wage rates of the Korean forest products industry allow these products to be exported competitively with the United States.", "Imports of U.S. softwood sawtimber logs were virtually negligible in comparison to consumption at 41 million board feet, for the first 6 months of 1978. Practically all U.S. imports of softwood logs come from Canada. Canada regulates the export of unprocessed softwood logs with the intent to export only softwood logs that are in excess supply of domestic demand. The United", "\nStates prohibits the export of softwood logs from Federal lands (basically National Forest lands), but does not prohibit export of logs from State and private lands. Softwood log exports have been controversial in the United States, especially during high domestic demand cycles.", "Lumber Imports", "Imports of softwood lumber, on the other hand, consistute a significant proportion of U.S. consumption of that item. For the first 6 months of 1978, Softwood lumber imports amounted to 5,578 million board feet, an increase of 12 percent over the same period last year. Canada continues to dominate the import share with 99 percent of total U.S. purchases of softwood lumber. In the first 6 months of 1978 imports accounted for 27 percent of apparent U.S. domestic consumption. For the first half of 1977, imports of softwood lumber accounted for 25 percent of apparent domestic consumption. The devaluation of the Canadian dollar, low Canadian raw material costs, and relatively cheap transportation, especially from Bri-tish Columbia to eastern U.S. markets, have helped the Canadian exporters market their softwood products in this country.", "Plywood", "Softwood plywood production for the first 6 months of 1978 was 10,157 million board feet (3/8-inch basis), a 2 percent increase over the like period in 1977. Shipments of softwood plywood ran slightly less, however, Orders received were 1 percent greater for the first 6 months of this year over the like period last year. Exports of softwood plywood of 176 million square feet were running slightly less than the volume exported by mid-year 1977. The major drop in total volume of softwood plywood exports from 1976 to 1977 of 60 percent was due in major part, to (1) the increase in domestic demand for softwood plywood in 1977-78, (2) the Canadian resolution of Labor disputes in their forest products industry, and (3) the devaluation of the Canadian dollar. Also, the strong market for U.S. plywood in Canada in 1976 quickly diminished in 1977. Imports of softwood plywood are virtually negligible as a part of domestic consumption at 18 million square feet for the first 6 months of this year, and represent less than one-half of one percent of the apparent domestic consumption of softwood plywood.", "Softwood Prices", "Softwood lumber Producers Price Index (PPI\u2014formerly Wholesale Price Index) increased 22 percent from", "June 1977 to June 1978, and increased 16 percent from December 1977 to June of this year. The relatively high price increases of lumber and plywood compared to the \u201call commodities\u201d index led to President Carter\u2019s remark in his April 11, 1978, anti-inflation message that directed the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Council on Environmental Quality to find ways to increase timber sales from Federal lands. Increased timber sales from National Forests would, hopefully, ease supply price pressures on lumber and wood products. Another issue that would potentially affect timber sales volume, is the Road less Area ", "Review ", "and Evaluation (RARE II). About 62 million acres of roadless and undeveloped National Forest land are being reviewed under RARE II for the completion of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The RARE II process of land-use planning should be completed by the end of 1978. The industry points to the 26.5 million acres of commerical forest land being reviewed under RARE II as a necessary timber source to meet the projected rising demand for timber products until the end of the century.", "Other softwood product PPI'S in June 1978 were millwork at 244.9, a 27 percent increase over June 1977; softwood plywood at 236.0, a 16 percent increase over June 1977; and softwood veneer at 249.1 (1971=100), a 36 percent increase over last year.", "The current housing boom was the key factor in price increases to above a 20 percent level in the 1-year period. However, the increasing cost of raw material (the softwood log) to the primary producers of softwood products over the past several years is also an important factor influencing price increases. For instance, U.S. Forest Service statistics show that Douglas fir peeler (used for veneer and eventually plywood) log prices increased on the average from 1971 to 1977 about 19 percent each year to around $300 per thousand board feet. In 1971, Douglas fir peeler logs were selling at $128 per thousand. Douglas fir sawtimber log prices showed an average annual increase of 23.4 percent from 1971 to 1977 or a total of 163.5 percent in the 7-year period.

", "Source: Swedish Central Bureau of Statistics. ", "VENEZUELA'S MAJOR FORESTRY PROJECTS", "(Excerpted from American Embassy-Caracas Report)", "Summary", "Venezuela has begun a number of large forestry projects to satisfy the fiber requirements of that nation's pulp and paper Mills. Raw material needs are particularly acute with respect to secondary fibers for the paper and board industry, long-fibered pulp for newsprint, and softwood timber for use in the construction industry. The pulp and paper industry is heavily dependent on imports, with 83 percent of all pulp requirements being imported. As these projects reach maturity, opportunities for U.S. businessmen will arise in construction, consulting/engineering, and equipment sales.", "Because of current pulp, short fiber, and timber shortages, Venezuela has embarked on an ambitious planting/development program for Caribbean pine and eucalyptus in the southern Anzoategui and northern Monagas State areas, respectively. The objective is to convert the Sabanas into a gigantic forestry and industry complex capable of supporting several pulp Mills that would not only supply domestic needs but also provide valuable export income. The two major government agencies responsible for these developments are Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) and Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CNR).", "Uverito ", "Project ", "The Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "was begun in 1969 by Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana with the intention of planting 218 million trees on 150,000 hectares by 1985, in order to produce long fiber pulp-mainly for the production of newsprint. Long fiber pulp is currently imported at an annual rate of 80,000 tons. Caribbean pine (Hondurensis), imported from Guatemala and other Central American countries, is the type of tree being planted. To date, about 80 million trees have been planted on 110,000 acres, with an additional 110 million planned for 1984. Plans are being made to harvest trees for pulp production in 1984. Eventually, 4,000 hectares out of every 10,000 will be harvested for pulp, with the remainder being conserved for timber production (maturity: about 10 to 15 years). By 1986, CVG expects to reach the 4,000 hectare level, with an expected yield of 180 cubic meters per hectare. CVG will require forestry equipment and technical assistance for the extraction process.", "In preparation for the harvesting period, CVG has plans to build a pulp mill capable of producing 200,000 tons annually, which should be completed by the 1984 deadline. Decisions on outside equity participation and exact composition have yet to be made, but the mill will be separately managed from the rest of the forestry ", "proj", "ect, and probably will be structured in the manner of other CVG corporations such as SIDOR, VENALUM. and ALCASE. While a feasibility study had been made at the initial conception of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project, ", "it considered tropical woods rather than pines as the basic raw material. A probable timetable for Uverito development is: late 1978-79 for new feasibility studies; 1979-81 for decisions on equity participation; 1981-82 for start of construction; and 1984 for start-up of production.", "CONARE", "Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CONARE) was created in August 1975, with the mandate to take responsibility for Venezuela's forestry industry (excluding Uverito). Under Federal decree No. 1341 of December 16, 1975, CONARE was authorized to incorporate the private sector into Venezuela's forestry programs. While CONARE has several small experimental forests throughout the country, its major area of development is in South Anzoategui and Monagas States, on land owned by the National Agrarian Institute. Here CONARE has about 100,000 hectares which it plans to divide into seven huge blocks and to develop, in conjunction with its Venezuelan and foreign partners, a large Caribbean pine and eucalyptus plantation.", "Companies established by CONARE include: (1) Corporacion Forestal Guayamure, with an area of about 10,000 hectares of Caribbean pine; (2) Forestor, with an area of 75,000 hectares which will be planted to eucalyptus to support a 300,000 ton-year pulp mill; and (3) Corporacion Forestal Sipao S.A., which will plant 18,000 hectares of short-fibered eucalyptus.", "Other Projects", "Corporation Venezolana de Fomento is doing a feasibility study for a bagasse mill at Rio Turbio.

More than 90 percent of the raw material furnished would be thermomechanical pulp produced at the mill; the remainder will be imported in the form of bleached sulfate pulp. About 450,000 cubic meters-year of radiata pine is available from about 53,000 hectares of State-owned forest in the area around Albury. ANM presently operates a newsprint mill in Tasmania, and the combined production from both Mills would satisfy about 70 percent of Australia's annual newsprint consumption. This will reduce the country's dependence on imported newsprint\u2014 about 200,000 tons annually, mainly from New ", "Zealand ", "and Canada\u2014and will save about A$70 million in foreign exchange.", "The planning and design of the mill is well under way, and the selection of equipment has reached an advanced", "stage.

", "VENEZUELA'S MAJOR FORESTRY PROJECTS", "(Excerpted from American Embassy-Caracas Report)", "Summary", "Venezuela has begun a number of large forestry projects to satisfy the fiber requirements of that nation's pulp and paper Mills. Raw material needs are particularly acute with respect to secondary fibers for the paper and board industry, long-fibered pulp for newsprint, and softwood timber for use in the construction industry. The pulp and paper industry is heavily dependent on imports, with 83 percent of all pulp requirements being imported. As these projects reach maturity, opportunities for U.S. businessmen will arise in construction, consulting/engineering, and equipment sales.", "Because of current pulp, short fiber, and timber shortages, Venezuela has embarked on an ambitious planting/development program for Caribbean pine and eucalyptus in the southern Anzoategui and northern Monagas State areas, respectively. The objective is to convert the Sabanas into a gigantic forestry and industry complex capable of supporting several pulp Mills that would not only supply domestic needs but also provide valuable export income. The two major government agencies responsible for these developments are Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) and Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CNR).", "Uverito ", "Project ", "The Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "was begun in 1969 by Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana with the intention of planting 218 million trees on 150,000 hectares by 1985, in order to produce long fiber pulp-mainly for the production of newsprint. Long fiber pulp is currently imported at an annual rate of 80,000 tons. Caribbean pine (Hondurensis), imported from Guatemala and other Central American countries, is the type of tree being planted. To date, about 80 million trees have been planted on 110,000 acres, with an additional 110 million planned for 1984. Plans are being made to harvest trees for pulp production in 1984. Eventually, 4,000 hectares out of every 10,000 will be harvested for pulp, with the remainder being conserved for timber production (maturity: about 10 to 15 years). By 1986, CVG expects to reach the 4,000 hectare level, with an expected yield of 180 cubic meters per hectare. CVG will require forestry equipment and technical assistance for the extraction process.", "In preparation for the harvesting period, CVG has plans to build a pulp mill capable of producing 200,000 tons annually, which should be completed by the 1984 deadline. Decisions on outside equity participation and exact composition have yet to be made, but the mill will be separately managed from the rest of the forestry ", "proj", "ect, and probably will be structured in the manner of other CVG corporations such as SIDOR, VENALUM. and ALCASE. While a feasibility study had been made at the initial conception of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project, ", "it considered tropical woods rather than pines as the basic raw material. A probable timetable for Uverito development is: late 1978-79 for new feasibility studies; 1979-81 for decisions on equity participation; 1981-82 for start of construction; and 1984 for start-up of production.", "CONARE", "Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CONARE) was created in August 1975, with the mandate to take responsibility for Venezuela's forestry industry (excluding Uverito). Under Federal decree No. 1341 of December 16, 1975, CONARE was authorized to incorporate the private sector into Venezuela's forestry programs. While CONARE has several small experimental forests throughout the country, its major area of development is in South Anzoategui and Monagas States, on land owned by the National Agrarian Institute. Here CONARE has about 100,000 hectares which it plans to divide into seven huge blocks and to develop, in conjunction with its Venezuelan and foreign partners, a large Caribbean pine and eucalyptus plantation.", "Companies established by CONARE include: (1) Corporacion Forestal Guayamure, with an area of about 10,000 hectares of Caribbean pine; (2) Forestor, with an area of 75,000 hectares which will be planted to eucalyptus to support a 300,000 ton-year pulp mill; and (3) Corporacion Forestal Sipao S.A., which will plant 18,000 hectares of short-fibered eucalyptus.", "Other Projects", "Corporation Venezolana de Fomento is doing a feasibility study for a bagasse mill at Rio Turbio.

Newsprint Mill Planned in Australia", "Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd. (ANM) has announced a go-ahead for construction of a A$155 million newsprint mill at Albury, in New South Wales. The New South Wales Government had encouraged the construction of the mill with various incentives, including housing, payroll tax rebates, machinery subsidies, employee training subsidies, and financial assistance in locating key perSonnel.", "The mill will eventually have the capacity to produce 180,000 tons of newsprint a year, raising ANM'S total annual capacity to more than 380,000 tons. More than 90 percent of the raw material furnished would be thermomechanical pulp produced at the mill; the remainder will be imported in the form of bleached sulfate pulp. About 450,000 cubic meters-year of radiata pine is available from about 53,000 hectares of State-owned forest in the area around Albury. ANM presently operates a newsprint mill in Tasmania, and the combined production from both Mills would satisfy about 70 percent of Australia's annual newsprint consumption. This will reduce the country's dependence on imported newsprint\u2014 about 200,000 tons annually, mainly from New ", "Zealand ", "and Canada\u2014and will save about A$70 million in foreign exchange.", "The planning and design of the mill is well under way, and the selection of equipment has reached an advanced", "stage.

Indonesia: Report on Two Wood-Processing Complexes: P.T. Raja Garuda Mas and the Plywood Oligopoly", "The wood-processing complex of P.T. Raja Garuda Mas is located at Besitong in North Sumatra province near the border with Aceh. Established in 1974, the firm began operations with only a plywood mill but, in the intervening years, has added two sawmill units and a plant which produces wood-cement panels for prefabricated houses.", "In addition to plywood for construction purposes, the facility also turns out decorative veneer for furniture. Most of the equipment in the plywood plant is of Japanese manufacture though there were two large peelers from a U.S. manufacturer, Production Machinery Inc. of Portland, Oregon. Capacity of the plywood operation is 12,000-15,000 sheets (measuring four feet by eight feet, with a thickness of four millimeters) per day. The plant operates 24 hours per day with the exception of 2 days each month when shut down for maintenance.", "Garuda Mas' sawmill units were set up in 1977 to", "19", "comply with an Indonesian Government regulation compelling holders of timber concessions to process logs locally. As at the plywood facility, most of the equipment was imported from Japan.", "Also in 1977, the ", "company ", "began to manufacture wood-cement panels using as raw material the waste from its plywood and sawmill operations. Wood waste is chipped in a hammer mill, and is washed and mixed with cement to produce panels measuring one meter by twenty centimeters, with a thickness of five centimeters. These panels are used principally in the construction of low-cost, prefabricated houses. At present Garuda Mas produces about 3,000 panels per day.", "Garuda Mas obtains its timber from large concessions controlled by the firm in Aceh province, near the town of Idi. Logs are floated down the Besitong River to the plant site on the river bank. The river also serves as the company's inlet for imported raw materials, which are brought in by barge, mainly from Singapore. Most of the finished products are trucked to Medan's port, Belawan, for shipment to Java or abroad.", "P.T. Lontar Papyrus Paper Industry", "Established in 1974, Lontar Papyrus Paper Industry is situated in Aceh province, about twenty kilometers from the town of Langsa. The sole owner of the facility is a Medan resident of Chinese descent. Except for two technicians from Taiwan, the plant is staffed by local Indonesians. Much of the plant's equipment, which appears quite modern, is from Taiwan, though there is some from Japan and West Germany as well. Raw material, in the form of boxed pulp, is imported from the Scandinavian countries, Canada and the United States. Originally, the firm had hoped to procure most of its raw material locally but it discovered that it could obtain only enough wood to operate its chippers at 20 percent capacity. The ", "company ", "now hopes to arrange with one or more local timber companies to obtain the waste wood from logging operations for use in paper production. Lontar has no timber concession of its own. Present capacity of the Lontar operation is 30 tons per day, all of which is marketed in the Medan area. The plant produces paper with tensile strength from 28 to 70 grams. Reportedly, the ", "company ", "has no difficulty in selling all of the paper it makes during its round-the-clock operations. About 200 people are employed at the plant. Within the next year Lontar plans to expand its capacity to 100 tons per day. Land adjacent to the existing plant has been cleared and equipment for the expansion is on order. The firm plans to market part of its increased", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "My library", "Books on Google Play", "production in Java. Lontar's plant is located on a river which, at high tide, can accommodate barges of up to 1,500 tons. These barges, which at present bring imported raw materials for the plant, will, after the expansion, be used to ship finished products to Java. Shipments to Medan will continue to go by truck. Investment in the plant to date is calculated at U.S. $3 million. With the expansion of facilities contemplated, that investment will almost double. In addition to the domestic market, Garuda Mas sells significant quantities overseas. Sawtimber is exported to the United States, the Netherlands and Singapore, while railroad crossties are sold to Belgium. Limited quantities of plywood have been sent to the United Kingdom, where it passes rugged British quality standards. The major market for plywood, however, is Indonesia itself, particularly Java. Domestic plywood prices are often as much as 50 percent above prevailing world market levels. Demand is strong and shows no signs of slackening. To service its clients on Java, Garuda Mas maintains a sales office in Jakarta. It has also recently appointed a firm in Surabaya to handle distribution in Eastern Indonesia. Garuda Mas' Medan office will soon move to a new five-story structure in the heart of the city. The firm, which employs 1,900 persons, is entirely under the control of five brothers of Chinese extraction who reside in Medan. Source: American Embassy Indonesia report dated August 1978.", "4. Papua New Guinea: Timber Industry Expansion Underway", "Papua New Guinea has the potential of being one of", "the giants of the southeast Asian timber industries. It is second only to Indonesia in total forest area and a close third (after Malaysia) in readily harvestable acreage. Permits have been issued to harvest up to 1 million hectares", "of forest area, and an additional 1.2 million hectares of", "timber rights are available for leasing by developers. Another 8 million hectares is capable of being logged but timber rights would have to be negotiated with local owners. Papua New Guinea (PNG) has a total wood processing industry of 130 factories including 90 sawmills, one plywood mill, three veneer Mills and one woodchip mill. The industry employs 4,000 people, pays about $7 million per year in wages, and has a total investment of $42 million in land, buildings and plants. The industry currently earns about US $3 million in exports, or about 4 percent of total National export earn", "ings. Markets for these products are in Japan and Australia while Korea, Taiwan, and the Netherlands are beginning to buy some timber products. The industry also provides an estimated 60,000 cubic meters of sawn timber and 3,600 cubic meters of plywood for local consumption. The value of the locally consumed timber is US $24 million. The PNG Forestry Industry grew rapidly until about 1973-74 when world prices Fell. In 1974-75 two very large sawmills started operation; but despite this, total production Fell dramatically in 1974 and 1975. Production picked up in 1976 but Fell again in 1977.", "Industry Problems", "The stagnation of the timber industry May be attributed to lower international timber prices, the high cost of production in PNG, and strict government regulations. Papua New Guinea forests contain many different types of hardwoods\u2014in some cases as many as 100 different varieties in a single square mile. Core rot is prevalent. Minimum wage laws and low worker education levels have combined to make PNG a high Labor cost country. As a result of these conditions sawmilling a cubic yard of timber costs $85 as compared to $25 in the United States. Since PNG Government regulations have required a quick transition from export of logs to export of sawn timber, it is easy to comprehend why the timber industry has not prospered.", "Future Prospects", "The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Primary Industry, Julius Chan, has announced upcoming changes in Papua New Guinea's regulations. The changes will encourage greater log exports and will require less construction of social infrastructure on the part of new investors. Some tax breaks will be given to those companies already involved in sawmilling. Though roughly 6 dozen sawmills have closed down in the past 3 years, several are now in various stages of being re-opened under new management. In addition, serious negotiations are under way for major foreign investment in the timber industry. The most immediate is the plan of Hyundai, the Korean firm, to build a multi-million dollar woodchip mill in New Britain. Other projects under serious negotiation include a $2 million logging operation in Manus, a $2.5 million logging operation in the eastern highlands, and a $5-10 million forestry development ", "project ", "in Vanimo near the Irian Jaya border. The Department of Primary Industry is estimating that the new regulations will allow for a tripling of log exports over the next 3 years. This expansion will come partially through greater utilization of existing", "\ncapacity and partially out of additions of new capacity.", "Change in Industry Structure", "If the new regulations take effect as expected, there should be a great increase in the amount of logging. Many companies have found themselves in a position where they could sell logs but not sawn timber. The Government requirement to keep a fixed ratio between the two limited the company's log exports.", "In the meantime, many sawmills are turning inward to local markets. At present most furniture and wood products are still imported despite the great deal of surplus wood left over from sawmilling operations. Local firms are now beginning to build furniture, boxes, furniture parts, etc., and this industry is expected to grow in the next few years. The Government of Papua New Guinea has recently let a tender for a consulting contract to help develop a plan for such an industry in the Central province.", "Source: American Embassy Papua New Guinea report dated August 1978.", "5.

The purpose of the hearing was to determine the reasons for and solutions to the accelerating housing costs which contribute to general inflation within the U.S. economy. Testimony was presented at the hearing by organizations representing building materials consumers such as the National Association of Home Builders, the National Lumber and Building Materials Dealers, and the U.S. Department of Labor's Chicago Construction Coordinating Committee. The materials producers were represented by the National Forest Products Association and two major wood product manufacturers, Georgia-Pacific Corporation and Weyerhaeuser ", "Company. ", "Others testifying in", "cluded Congressman James Weaver of Oregon and representatives from conservation groups: Sierra Club, National Wildlife Federation, and National Resources Defense Council. Cited as common denominators of price inflation were: (1) ", "cyclical ", "demand ", "which May create supply-demand imbalance resulting in shortages and price increases; (2) ", "general ", "inflation ", "which affects all products and services such as wages, fringe benefits, transportation, machinery and equipment, taxes, and other business operation costs; (3) ", "raw ", "material ", "shortages ", "caused by reduced timber harvests on Federal timberlands and bidding up of stumpage prices (price of the standing tree) which affect lumber; (4) ", "capital ", "investment ", "which is difficult to raise or accumulate due to unattractive profits or profit potential, or tax laws and regulations which May constrain needed replacement, expansion, or modernization of plant equipment; (5) ", "over-expansion ", "in anticipation of continuing strong demand, which May not materialize and which May result in low capacity utilization, and possible closing or dismantling of marginal plants; and (6) ", "government ", "environmental ", "policies, ", "laws, ", "or ", "programs, ", "which materially increase the cost of doing business. Forest industry leaders stated that the best opportunity to increase wood product supply to meet housing and other demands is by making more timber available from the National Forest lands, which hold more than 50 percent of the Nation's inventory of softwood sawtimber. The industry suggested that immediate and near-term needs for expanded production of wood products must be met from the area where timber resources are located and where productionn capacity is underused, which is in the West. It was also suggested that the Government provide appropriate incentives to stimulate investments which would expand production capacity and improve productivity through further technological developments to increase yields from raw materials.

Most of the increase was in the Appalachian hardwood region which produced 20 percent of the hardwood lumber in the first half of 1978. Actual production in the Appalachian region was 628 million board feet, up 14 percent over last year. In the Southern hardwood region, hardwood lumber production for the same period was 1,457 million board feet, only slightly higher (1 percent) than last year. The remaining hardwood producing regions, the majority in the North Central States, produced 1,075 million board feet through June 1978, a 5 percent increase over the same period last year.", "Imports of hardwood lumber remained practically at the same level as the first 6 months of last year at 159 million board feet, with Canada supplying 31 percent, Brazil 24 percent, Malaysia 15 percent, and the Philippines 9 percent. Exports of hardwood lumber ran slightly ahead of imports at 163 million board feet. Canada purchased 50 percent of U.S. hardwood lumber exports, followed by France 17 percent, West Germany 13 percent, and the Netherlands 8 percent. Therefore, with production at 3,160 million board feet and exports and imports at the above levels, hardwood lumber imports account for 5 percent of domestic hardwood lumber apparent consumption.", "Lighter-colored hardwoods, such as oak, are replacing the once dominant darkwoods, such as walnut, in furniture manufacturing. Teakwood is especially expensive as a result of the self-imposed embargo on the export of unprocessed wood products from Thailand. Thailand is the major U.S. source of high quality teak, which is still unrivaled in boat deck construction. U.S. importers and boat builders are seeking to persuade the Thai's to reverse their embargo decision.", "Hardwood Plywood", "Hardwood plywood imports for the first half of 1978 were 2,440 million square feet (MMSF-surface measure), 12 percent above the similar period last year. The Republic of Korea was the major supplier at 1,326 MMSF or 53 percent. Taiwan was the next largest supplier at 31 percent, followed by Japan 7 percent, and the Philippines 5 percent. Hardwood plywood with a Philippine mahogany (sometimes called lauan) face accounted for 45 percent of hardwood plywood imports.", "Although monthly production figures for hardwood plywood are not available, yearly figures are published by the Bureau of the Census. In 1977, hardwood plywood production was 1,478 MMSF, an 8 percent increase over 1976. Manufacturers' shipments of hardwood plywood were 1,339 MMSF in 1977, valued at $4.68 million. Imports of hardwood plywood for domestic consumption", "were 4,186 MMSF valued at $429 million in 1977. Therefore, imports as a percent of domestic consumption were 76.5 percent (quantity basis) in 1977. U.S. exports of hardwood plywood were minimal at 4.1 percent of manufacturers' shipments. Manufacturers' shipments of hardwood plywood shipped in the unfinished state (to prefinishers) were 859 MMSF or 64 percent of manufacturers' shipments. The remaining 36 percent was shipped as prefinished; i.e., hardwood plywood manufactured and prefinished in the same establishment. Prefinished hardwood plywood made from purchased plywood was 2,190 MMSF. Purchases were made from domestic and foreign manufacturers. The South Atlantic States produced 44 percent of the quantity of production of veneer core (type II, moisture resistant) hardwood playwood in 1977. Type II, moistureresistant hardwood plywood represented 75 percent of hardwood plywood production in 1977. The Pacific States accounted for 34 percent of production, the East and North Central States 9 percent, the New England and Middle Atlantic States 6 percent. Although the Pacific States supplied 34 percent of production, only 51 percent of net volume of hardwood sawtimber on commercial timberland in the United States is located on the West Coast. Therefore, most of the hardwood plywood produced on the West Coast is dependent on hardwood veneer imports. Hardwood veneer imports in 1977 were 1,703 MMSF, an increase of 7 percent over 1976. In the first 6 months of 1978, imports were 794 MMSF, a decrease of 5 percent over the same period in 1977. Canada was the leading supplier of hardwood veneer to the United States\u2014mostly birch at 401 MMSF or 51 percent of U.S. imports from January\u2013June 1978. The Philippines was the second largest supplier of hardwood veneers to the United States at 188 MMSF or a 24 percent import share; Brazil supplied 85 MMSF or 11 percent; Peru 22 MMSF or 3 percent; and Malaysia, Indonesia, and Taiwan each supplied 1 percent. The Republic of Korea and Taiwan, the two largest suppliers of hardwood plywood to the United States, depend on Southeast Asian countries for their raw material supply\u2014hardwood logs. Japan is also a major importer of Southeast Asian hardwood logs. The supply of hardwood logs from the tropical less-developed countries to these producing countries May undergo major changes in the next two decades. Primarily, major forestry and wood product industry projects in these countries are aimed at developing the forest products industry to an extent that timber harvested would be converted to lumber, plywood, or paper products domestically, and then sold for internal consumption or export. Significant progress in industry development will, however, take some time\u2014at least until the end of the century. More importantly, however, is the alarming", "\nrate of deforestation in the developing countries of South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. At a June 1978 conference in Washington, D.C., private and public officials met to discuss the deforestation problem and its social, environmental, and economic implications for these countries and the world. Deforestration was attributed to (1) the expanding population's need to clear", "land for settlement and agriculture and (2) the extensive use of wood for fuel. While land clearing and settlement are considered as economic progress by the general population, such consequences as erosion, endangering delicate ecosystems, climate changes, and decrease of world wood supply are the results.", "SWEDISH PULP AND PAPER INDUSTRY: 1977 ", "REVIEW ", "AND OUTLOOK", "By the American Embassy in Stockholm", "Summary", "The recession in Sweden's key pulp and paper industry, one of the mainstays of the nation's prosperity and economic stability, continued through calender year 1977. Pulp and paper export prices remained very depressed throughout the year and yielded little or no profit to producers. By year's end, several companies found themselves in a precarious financial situation, and some were on the verge of bankruptcy. However, the ini-tial months of 1978 appeared to mark a turning point not only for Sweden's pulp and paper industry but for the West European industry as well. Economic activity in Western Europe seemed, at long last, to be on the upturn, and this was favorably reflected in a growing demand for pulp and paper. Moreover, the pressure from North American producers has eased in the West European market as a result of the rising demand for pulp and paper at home.", "Around mid-1978, optimism was growing in Sweden's pulp and paper industry. The large pulp inventories built up by Mills during 3 lean years to sustain mill employment have finally been brought down to normal operating levels. The backlog of orders for pulp and paper is increasing, mill operations are being stepped up, and export sales prices are being adjusted upward, though still not enough to compensate producers fully for their growing costs.", "Industry Remained Depressed in 1977", "The year 1977 brought little relief to Sweden's hardhit pulp industry. The total volume of export shipments in that year was no larger than in 1976 due mainly to the unsatisfactory rate of economic activity in Western Europe, which normally takes about 90 percent of Sweden's aggregate pulp exports. Other factors adversely affecting Sweden's pulp export trade were the continued high domestic cost inflation; the unstable currency market, particularly the declining U.S. dollar rate; and the keen competition in Sweden's traditional West European pulp market from North American, notably Canadian, producers. To meet the increasing North American competi. tion, the Swedish pulp industry was forced to make several", "downward price adjustments during 1977, and this occurred at a time when cost inflation at home was at an unprecedented level. This, of course, aggravated the already grave problems confronting Swedish pulp producers, bringing many of them to the verge of bandruptcy.", "The market situation in 1977 called for curtailed operations at many Mills. As a result, the industry as a whole used only 68 percent of its existing productive capacity during the year. A Bright spot in an otherwise cloudy picture was that the industry, largely through production cutbacks and intensive selling efforts in nonEuropean markets, was successful in bringing down mill pulp inventories from the costly and unwieldly level of well over 1.5 million metric tons at the end of 1976 to just over a million tons at the end of 1977. This heavy financial burden on Swedish pulp companies, resulting from previous Government-supported pulp inventory buildups to sustain mill employment, was thus well on the way to being eliminated late in 1977, which augured well for mill production during the months ahead. For data on Swedish production and exports of wood pulp by grade, see figures 1 and 2.", "Only 73 Percent of Capacity Used in 1977", "In terms of capacity utilization, Sweden's paper industry did better than the pulp industry during 1977. Production of paper and paperboard in that year totaled 5.1 million metric tons. This represented a gain of 2.3 percent over 1976 but, due to several new additions to plant facilities, production in 1977 amounted to only 73 percent of the industry's rated productive capacity. A relatively slow growth rate in West European paper and board consumption in conjunction with varying exchange rates and depressed prices were factors adversely affecting developments in Sweden's paper industry. Export shipments, however, were maintained at a relatively satisfactory level, but at prices that yielded little or no profit to producers. Moreover, mill inventories of paper and board continued to accumulate during the year and effectively prevented producers from making any upward adjustments in export or home market prices.", "Sweden's exports of paper and board during 1977 totaled 3.7 million tons, compared to 3.4 million tons in 1976. The increase was attributed mainly to larger shipments of kraft liner, fluting paper, and various grades of", "\nprinting paper. A notable feature was that virtually all of the increase in exports attained during 1977 consisted of paper and board destined to countries outside the European Common Market, mainly to customers in Asia and Africa. For data on Swedish production and export of paper and board, see figures 3 and 4.", "Continued Freeze of EC Paper Ceilings", "Under the import tariff dismantling terms of Sweden's free trade agreement with the European Community (EC), tariffs on paper and board, except newsprint, imported from Sweden were lowered from 10 to 8 percent ad valorem effective July 1, 1977. The tariff dismantling schedule calls for a reduction in EC tariffs on most grades of paper and board from 12 percent in 1973 to zero duty by 1984. The next tariff cut to 6 percent is to be January 1, 1979.", "Eight import ceilings are enforced by the EC for specific categories of paper and board supplied by Sweden. Originally, it was the intention of the EC to raise these ceilings by 5 percent annually. Paper and board imports from Sweden in excess of these ceilings are, in most cases, dutiable at a penalty rate, which is the full rate of 12 percent ad valorem that existed before the free trade agreement was concluded. During 1977, Swedish exporters were obliged to pay penalty rates for exceeding four of the eight import ceilings. Early in 1978 it was announced that the EC, reportedly at the request of some member nations (France and Belgium were specifically mentioned in the Swedish press), had decided on a continued freeze of three ceilings during calendar year 1978. This means that the earlier intended 5 percent increase of those ceilings will not be implemented for the third year in succession. It is noted in this connection that the EC, in 1976, had reached a decision to freeze all eight of its ceilings for imports of Swedish paper and board. This move was taken in retaliation against the imposition in the same year of Swedish import restrictions on shoes.", "Outlook Improves for Pulp and Paper Industry", "The market Outlook for Sweden's pulp and paper industry, which early in 1978 was judged with considerable caution, not to say pessimism, is now generally regarded in industry circles to be improving. The industry foresees an improvement in its overall order book position during the months ahead, especially with respect to export orders. Developments since the end of 1977 indicate that the Western European economy is beginning to show signs of recovery, and although the upturn has been slight, it has already had a favorable effect on activity in Sweden's pulp and paper industry. Moreover, the rising demand for pulp", "and paper in North America is reported by Swedish trades to have eased the price pressure from North American producers in the West European market.", "Swedish pulp and paper industry spokesmen recently stated that they have now, for the first time since 1974, been enabled to make upward adjustments in export prices. This, they say is a welcome development not only because the EC Commission has accused Swedish and other Nordic producers, of dumping their chemical pulp in the EC market, but also because the Swedish industry will now be in a position to reduce somewhat the losses suffered in recent years. Swedish producers attribute their low price policy in the Common Market to the need for competing in prices with North American exporters. Growing demand at home is said to be reducing American and Canadian interest in the West European market. This, in conjunction with a continued sharp reduction in previously unwieldy mill pulp inventories, paved the way for some eagerly awaited improvements in Swedish pulp export prices. After having reduced prices to extremely low levels, the Swedish pulp industry was, at long last, in a position to announce upward price adjustments for export shipments during the third quarter of 1978. For major pulp grades, those prices are the following (per ton, cost, insurance, and freight\u2014c.i.f., West European ports): longfiber bleached sulfate\u2014$340; bleached sulfite\u2014 $325; birchwood pulp\u2014$320. Although these prices are from $15 to $20 higher than those previously quoted, they are still not quite adequate to compensate producers for their rising production costs. According to one industry official, a price of about $380 per ton for most major pulp grades would be needed to give producers what they now regard as a reasonable profit margin.", "According to industry sources, Sweden's pulp industry is expected to step up operations substantially during the second half of 1978 now that the previously large mill pulp inventories have been brought down to normal operating levels. As a result, the rate of capacity utilization in calendar 1978 is expected to average about 80 percent, compared to 68 percent in 1977. Total pulp production (chemical, semi-chemical, and mechanical, except defibrated and exploded pulps entering directly into hardboard and insulation board production) is expected to increase to 8.4 million metric tons in 1978 from 7.7 million tons in 1977, a gain of over 9 percent. This production increase will be made possible largely as the result of a recovery of markets in Western Europe previously lost to North American producers, and of a substantial increase in pulp shipments to Asian countries, notably Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. A rather substantial increase in paper and board production is also predicted. According to industry sources, output in 1978 is", "\nexpected to attain an all-time high and exceed that of 1977 by at least 12 percent.", "1978-83 Expansion Plans", "Despite several lean years, Sweden's pulp and paper industry plans to proceed with its expansion and plant improvement program during the coming 5-year period. This was revealed in a recent study conducted by the Swedish Pulp and Paper Association. The industry, however, has decided to go slow with the implementation of this program during 1978 and has cut back on previously earmarked investment in new plant and equipment for the current year. According to the study, the Swedish pulp industry's present annual capacity totals 1 1.5 million metric tons. This figure includes all grades of wood pulp (both captive and market pulps) but excludes defibrated and exploded pulps used directly for the manufacture of hardboard or insulation board. By 1983, total annual capacity is expected to amount to 12.5 million tons. The industry's present capacity of 11.5 million tons is distributed as follows: chemical pulp, 8.2 million tons; and semi-chemical pulp, 0.5 million tons. There will be little change in this capacity during 1979. As for paper, the industry's present plans call for an overall capacity increase of 1.3 million metric tons, to 8.3 million tons, by 1983.

This was an 11 percent increase over the same period in 1977. Actual starts of residential construction for the first 6 months showed 986,400 starts, an increase of 4.0 percent. Single family dwellings comprised 72 percent of the total housing starts, compared to 75 percent a year earlier. The percent of single family starts is a key indicator for solid wood product demand since more lumber and plywood are used in single family construction than in multiple unit construction. In general, common walls and use of substitute materials such as brick and block in multi-family construction reduce the amount of structural wood products used.", "Lumber", "For the first 6 months of 1978, production, shipments, and orders received of softwood lumber were running slightly less than the same period in 1977.

The reduced levels of production and orders of softwood lumber during such a high rate of demand possibly reflect the severe winter weather over the first part of the year, reducing logging operations and construction activity, and the anticipation by lumber wholesalers that housing demand\u2014thus lumber demand\u2014will taper off by the end of 1978.", "Specifically, softwood lumber production in the southern pine region for the first 6 months of 1978 was essentially the same as in 1977; the Douglas fir region showed a 4.8 percent increase in production; the western pine region a 4.0 percent decrease; the California redwood region, a 6.3 percent decrease, and other softwood regions at virtually the same pace. The southern pine region produced 26 percent of the total softwood lumber for January\u2013June 1978; 30 percent for the Douglas fir region, 31 percent for the western pine region, and 7.3 percent for the California redwood region. Therefore, the Pacific Northwest continues to produce the majority of the softwood lumber needs for the domestic and export market. However, indications are that the direction of", "flow of softwood lumber from the Southern and Pacific Northwest-producing region are changing. Freight rates on the Nation's rail lines from the Pacific Northwest to the northeastern consuming regions are, according to industry sources, becoming cost prohibitive. The southern producing region (basically the southeastern States) has an increasing advantage in the freight proportion of the lumber costs to the northeastern wholesaler. Also, various sources indicate that the Pacific Northwest producers are directing sales to western markets and export. U.S. exports of softwood lumber to all countries for the first six months of 1978 were 703 million board feet, a 12 percent decrease from the same period last year. Japan and Canada were the two leading purchasers of U.S. softwood lumber, buying 203 and 193 million board feet, respectively. These two countries purchased 56 percent of U.S. lumber exports. Australian purchases ranked third at 68 million board feet and Italy ranked fourth at 58 million board feet.

Exports of softwood plywood of 176 million square feet were running slightly less than the volume exported by mid-year 1977. The major drop in total volume of softwood plywood exports from 1976 to 1977 of 60 percent was due in major part, to (1) the increase in domestic demand for softwood plywood in 1977-78, (2) the Canadian resolution of Labor disputes in their forest products industry, and (3) the devaluation of the Canadian dollar. Also, the strong market for U.S. plywood in Canada in 1976 quickly diminished in 1977.

As published by the American Paper Institute, the capacity utilization rates for paper Mills averaged 93.4 percent in the first 6 months of 1978 while those for paperboard Mills averaged 91.9 percent in the same period. Capacity utilization rates in the comparable period a year ago averaged 91.7 percent and 91.1 percent, respectively. Production of the paper grades, which amounted to 7.4 million tons in the second quarter, was up 2.3 percent over the first quarter figure and totaled 14.6 million tons for the first 6 months of the year, a 5.9 percent increase over the comparable 1977 period. Reflecting sharp gains in the nondurables sector and a pickup in export trade, the packaging-oriented paperboard segment showed a ", "7.7 ", "percent favorable quarter-to-quarter change and totaled 14.3 million tons in the January\u2013June period. Since the growth pattern emulated that shown in 1977, there was only a small improvement in the comparative 1977-78 half-year totals. Production of the building paper and board components, reflecting the continued high level of construction activity, climbed 8.9 percent higher in the second quarter and amounted to 2.8 million tons for the first half of 1978, a 4.9 percent increase over the first 6 months of 1977. In the paper sector, year-to-year improvements were evident in production of virtually all grades of paper but continued to be centered mainly in the printing and writing papers, which are currently reflecting the expanding demand from the burgeoning magazine industry and continuing growth in overall advertising. As a group, printing and writing paper represents the bulk of all paper output, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total paper output. Production of these papers was up 8.5 percent in the first half of 1978 compared with the similar period in 1977. The other two major paper grade sectors, tissues and coarse papers were up 3.1 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. Preliminary reports on second quarter production of some paper grades such as newsprint, coated two-sides printing papers, bristols, and the bag and sack papers, indicated lower second quarter output. Paperboard production finished the second quarter on the upbeat with a notable trend in the quickening tempo of linerboard production. Production of linerboard, the bedrock for the industry, increased 6.6 percent in the", "second quarter and totaled 6.8 million tons for the half year. Annualized, the second quarter rate would represent record production levels. Output of the combination paperboard grades, which use wastepaper as the major fiber source, moved up in the second quarter but finished the half year only 1.6 percent higher than the same period a year ago. Production of the bleached paperboard grades showed a comparative year-to-year decline of 14 percent as a strong second quarter performance, particularly in milk carton stock, was unable to offset a poor first quarter output and a similar strong second quarter showing a year ago. Second quarter production of the building paper and board grades was 8.7 percent higher than the first quarter total. Output of building papers, amounting to 1,006 thousand tons, represented a 13.8 percent improvement over the comparable 6-month period in 1977.", "Imports Up Markedly", "Aside from higher newsprint imports, which tradi-tionally amount to more than 60 percent of the total U.S. requirement of newsprint, imports in the past 2 years have been expanded because of higher domestic demand for printing papers, particularly coated lightweight magazine paper which is in tight supply in the United States. For the first 6 months of the year, import tonnage of all paper, board and converted products totaled 4.6 million tons, up 25.5 percent over the similar period in 1977. The value of imports, totaling $1.4 billion, was up by 25 percent over the first 6 months of 1977. Second quarter imports, climbing further, were up 16.5 percent over the first quarter total.", "Most of the paper and board imports are in the form of printing paper. Newsprint imports, which dropped in relative importance, still represent 85 percent of the total paper and board imports. In the first half of 1978, imports of newsprint, and uncoated and coated printing papers accounted for 91.5 percent of all paper and board products, with building paper and board accounting for an additional 5 percent.", "Newsprint imports which totaled 3.7 million tons in the January\u2013June period were up by 16.4 percent over the total recorded in the same period in 1977. Second quarter newsprint imports were up 14.8 percent over the first quarter figure. Uncoated printing papers, other than newsprint, totaled 346,000 tons in the first half of 1978 and showed a second quarter gain of 23 percent. Coated printing paper imports approached 140,000 tons in the first 6 months of 1978, and were up 11.8 percent in the second quarter. Imports of building paper and board, reflective of the strong demand engendered by heightened building activity in the United States totaled 250,200 tons, a 75 percent increase over last year's level for the same 6-month period.", "Exports Move Up in Second Quarter", "Export volume of paper, board and converted products totaled 942,000 tons in the second quarter, which represented a 13.9 percent increase over the depressed first quarter shipments to foreign markets. Overall, exports were up 6.6 percent in the first half of the year; however, year-to-year declines still were evident in the paper grades. As a result, exports of the primary paper and board grades were up only a modest 1.6 percent in the first half of the year despite a sharp gain (12.2 percent) in the second quarter.", "Exports of the primary paperboard products, which amounted to 1,155,000 tons for the first 6 months of 1978, were up 10.7 percent in the second quarter and 8.3 percent when compared to the first half of 1977. Linerboard trade, normally the key to the industry's export performance, finished the half year at a reported 804,000 tons, up 8.9 percent over the similar period in 1977 but below the past 10-year average. A firming woodpulp market, disrupted since 1975 by massive producer-held inventories and improving European economies, points toward improvement in second half linerboard exports.", "Exports of Special foodboard continued to grow, climbing 35.9 percent over the first quarter tonnage. First", "half exports of Special foodboard were reported to be 169,900 tons setting the stage for another record-breaking year. While markets are maturing for bleached boards in the United States, exports of this Commodity, destined for countries with changing modes of food distribution and climbing living standards, have grown at an average annual rate of 18.1 percent since 1967. Converted paper and board products, a relatively fast growing export segment over the past 5 years, moved up only modestly in the second quarter. However, for the half year, converted products totaled 168,000 tons, up 51.2 percent over the reported half-year figure for 1977.", "Prices Up Moderately", "Paper prices overall, as measured by the Producer Price Index (former Wholesale Price Index), rose a modest 4.2 percent in the January\u2013June period. Paperboard prices were up 4.4 percent and converted product prices were up only 2.9 percent during the 6-month period. Building board prices, directly influenced by the strong demand, were up 12.7 percent in the January\u2013June period. In comparison, average prices for all industrial commodities in the first half of 1978 rose 2.1 percent.", "COMMODITY TRENDS: SOLID WOOD PRODUCTS January-June 1977-78", "By David K. Henry", "Softwood Products", "Demand for softwood solid wood products was off to a brisk pace in the first half of 1978 as U.S. housing starts, on a seasonally adjusted annual basis for the second quarter of this year, was over the two million mark (a 2,114,000 average). This was an 11 percent increase over the same period in 1977. Actual starts of residential construction for the first 6 months showed 986,400 starts, an increase of 4.0 percent. Single family dwellings comprised 72 percent of the total housing starts, compared to 75 percent a year earlier. The percent of single family starts is a key indicator for solid wood product demand since more lumber and plywood are used in single family construction than in multiple unit construction. In general, common walls and use of substitute materials such as brick and block in multi-family construction reduce the amount of structural wood products used.", "Lumber", "For the first 6 months of 1978, production, shipments, and orders received of softwood lumber were running slightly less than the same period in 1977. Production of softwood lumber was less than half of one percent below the first half of 1977, while shipments were 1 percent less and orders received were about 2 1/2 percent less. The reduced levels of production and orders of softwood lumber during such a high rate of demand possibly reflect the severe winter weather over the first part of the year, reducing logging operations and construction activity, and the anticipation by lumber wholesalers that housing demand\u2014thus lumber demand\u2014will taper off by the end of 1978.", "Specifically, softwood lumber production in the southern pine region for the first 6 months of 1978 was essentially the same as in 1977; the Douglas fir region showed a 4.8 percent increase in production; the western pine region a 4.0 percent decrease; the California redwood region, a 6.3 percent decrease, and other softwood regions at virtually the same pace. The southern pine region produced 26 percent of the total softwood lumber for January\u2013June 1978; 30 percent for the Douglas fir region, 31 percent for the western pine region, and 7.3 percent for the California redwood region. Therefore, the Pacific Northwest continues to produce the majority of the softwood lumber needs for the domestic and export market. However, indications are that the direction of", "flow of softwood lumber from the Southern and Pacific Northwest-producing region are changing. Freight rates on the Nation's rail lines from the Pacific Northwest to the northeastern consuming regions are, according to industry sources, becoming cost prohibitive. The southern producing region (basically the southeastern States) has an increasing advantage in the freight proportion of the lumber costs to the northeastern wholesaler. Also, various sources indicate that the Pacific Northwest producers are directing sales to western markets and export. U.S. exports of softwood lumber to all countries for the first six months of 1978 were 703 million board feet, a 12 percent decrease from the same period last year. Japan and Canada were the two leading purchasers of U.S. softwood lumber, buying 203 and 193 million board feet, respectively. These two countries purchased 56 percent of U.S. lumber exports. Australian purchases ranked third at 68 million board feet and Italy ranked fourth at 58 million board feet. Douglas fir lumber was the major softwood lumber export item at 244 million board feet; hemlock was at 144 million board feet; southern pine at 68 million board feet; and spruce at 60 million board feet.", "Logs", "U.S. softwood log exports, primarily from the Pacific Northwest, were 11.4 percent greater for the first 6 months of 1978 compared to the like period in 1977. Total export volume of softwood logs was 1,718 million board feet. Japan purchased 78 percent of U.S. softwood log exports. The Republic of Korea (South Korea) increased its U.S. softwood log purchases by 250 percent in the first 6 months of 1978 over the same period in 1977, to 225 million board feet or 13 percent of the export volume. Industry sources indicate that Korea's purchases of U.S. softwood logs are ultimately consumed by (1) the domestic market, and (2) the export market, to either Europe or Japan. The lower wage rates of the Korean forest products industry allow these products to be exported competitively with the United States.", "Imports of U.S. softwood sawtimber logs were virtually negligible in comparison to consumption at 41 million board feet, for the first 6 months of 1978. Practically all U.S. imports of softwood logs come from Canada. Canada regulates the export of unprocessed softwood logs with the intent to export only softwood logs that are in excess supply of domestic demand. The United", "\nStates prohibits the export of softwood logs from Federal lands (basically National Forest lands), but does not prohibit export of logs from State and private lands. Softwood log exports have been controversial in the United States, especially during high domestic demand cycles.", "Lumber Imports", "Imports of softwood lumber, on the other hand, consistute a significant proportion of U.S. consumption of that item. For the first 6 months of 1978, Softwood lumber imports amounted to 5,578 million board feet, an increase of 12 percent over the same period last year. Canada continues to dominate the import share with 99 percent of total U.S. purchases of softwood lumber. In the first 6 months of 1978 imports accounted for 27 percent of apparent U.S. domestic consumption. For the first half of 1977, imports of softwood lumber accounted for 25 percent of apparent domestic consumption. The devaluation of the Canadian dollar, low Canadian raw material costs, and relatively cheap transportation, especially from Bri-tish Columbia to eastern U.S. markets, have helped the Canadian exporters market their softwood products in this country.", "Plywood", "Softwood plywood production for the first 6 months of 1978 was 10,157 million board feet (3/8-inch basis), a 2 percent increase over the like period in 1977. Shipments of softwood plywood ran slightly less, however, Orders received were 1 percent greater for the first 6 months of this year over the like period last year. Exports of softwood plywood of 176 million square feet were running slightly less than the volume exported by mid-year 1977. The major drop in total volume of softwood plywood exports from 1976 to 1977 of 60 percent was due in major part, to (1) the increase in domestic demand for softwood plywood in 1977-78, (2) the Canadian resolution of Labor disputes in their forest products industry, and (3) the devaluation of the Canadian dollar. Also, the strong market for U.S. plywood in Canada in 1976 quickly diminished in 1977. Imports of softwood plywood are virtually negligible as a part of domestic consumption at 18 million square feet for the first 6 months of this year, and represent less than one-half of one percent of the apparent domestic consumption of softwood plywood.", "Softwood Prices", "Softwood lumber Producers Price Index (PPI\u2014formerly Wholesale Price Index) increased 22 percent from", "June 1977 to June 1978, and increased 16 percent from December 1977 to June of this year. The relatively high price increases of lumber and plywood compared to the \u201call commodities\u201d index led to President Carter\u2019s remark in his April 11, 1978, anti-inflation message that directed the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Council on Environmental Quality to find ways to increase timber sales from Federal lands. Increased timber sales from National Forests would, hopefully, ease supply price pressures on lumber and wood products. Another issue that would potentially affect timber sales volume, is the Road less Area ", "Review ", "and Evaluation (RARE II). About 62 million acres of roadless and undeveloped National Forest land are being reviewed under RARE II for the completion of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The RARE II process of land-use planning should be completed by the end of 1978. The industry points to the 26.5 million acres of commerical forest land being reviewed under RARE II as a necessary timber source to meet the projected rising demand for timber products until the end of the century.", "Other softwood product PPI'S in June 1978 were millwork at 244.9, a 27 percent increase over June 1977; softwood plywood at 236.0, a 16 percent increase over June 1977; and softwood veneer at 249.1 (1971=100), a 36 percent increase over last year.", "The current housing boom was the key factor in price increases to above a 20 percent level in the 1-year period. However, the increasing cost of raw material (the softwood log) to the primary producers of softwood products over the past several years is also an important factor influencing price increases. For instance, U.S. Forest Service statistics show that Douglas fir peeler (used for veneer and eventually plywood) log prices increased on the average from 1971 to 1977 about 19 percent each year to around $300 per thousand board feet. In 1971, Douglas fir peeler logs were selling at $128 per thousand. Douglas fir sawtimber log prices showed an average annual increase of 23.4 percent from 1971 to 1977 or a total of 163.5 percent in the 7-year period. The average price of all grades of Douglas fir sawtimber logs in 1977 was about $227 per MBF.", "Prices quoted are for water and inland sales used in domestic consumption. Export sales have generally been at considerably higher prices than domestic sales. In 1977, the price differential between domestic and export log sales was about $85 per thousand board feet for Douglas fir peeler logs, due partly to the higher grade of peeler logs sold for export.", "Hardwoods", "Hardwood lumber production for the first 6 months of 1978 was 3,160 million board feet, about a 5 percent", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "45 ", "                        Table S-20.\u2013U.S. Imports of Solid Wood Products by Major Supplier Countries, 1976-78\u2013Con.

Lontar's plant is located on a river which, at high tide, can accommodate barges of up to 1,500 tons. These barges, which at present bring imported raw materials for the plant, will, after the expansion, be used to ship finished products to Java. Shipments to Medan will continue to go by truck. Investment in the plant to date is calculated at U.S. $3 million. With the expansion of facilities contemplated, that investment will almost double. In addition to the domestic market, Garuda Mas sells significant quantities overseas. Sawtimber is exported to the United States, the Netherlands and Singapore, while railroad crossties are sold to Belgium. Limited quantities of plywood have been sent to the United Kingdom, where it passes rugged British quality standards. The major market for plywood, however, is Indonesia itself, particularly Java. Domestic plywood prices are often as much as 50 percent above prevailing world market levels. Demand is strong and shows no signs of slackening. To service its clients on Java, Garuda Mas maintains a sales office in Jakarta. It has also recently appointed a firm in Surabaya to handle distribution in Eastern Indonesia. Garuda Mas' Medan office will soon move to a new five-story structure in the heart of the city. The firm, which employs 1,900 persons, is entirely under the control of five brothers of Chinese extraction who reside in Medan. Source: American Embassy Indonesia report dated August 1978.", "4. Papua New Guinea: Timber Industry Expansion Underway", "Papua New Guinea has the potential of being one of", "the giants of the southeast Asian timber industries. It is second only to Indonesia in total forest area and a close third (after Malaysia) in readily harvestable acreage. Permits have been issued to harvest up to 1 million hectares", "of forest area, and an additional 1.2 million hectares of", "timber rights are available for leasing by developers. Another 8 million hectares is capable of being logged but timber rights would have to be negotiated with local owners. Papua New Guinea (PNG) has a total wood processing industry of 130 factories including 90 sawmills, one plywood mill, three veneer Mills and one woodchip mill. The industry employs 4,000 people, pays about $7 million per year in wages, and has a total investment of $42 million in land, buildings and plants. The industry currently earns about US $3 million in exports, or about 4 percent of total National export earn", "ings. Markets for these products are in Japan and Australia while Korea, Taiwan, and the Netherlands are beginning to buy some timber products. The industry also provides an estimated 60,000 cubic meters of sawn timber and 3,600 cubic meters of plywood for local consumption. The value of the locally consumed timber is US $24 million. The PNG Forestry Industry grew rapidly until about 1973-74 when world prices Fell. In 1974-75 two very large sawmills started operation; but despite this, total production Fell dramatically in 1974 and 1975. Production picked up in 1976 but Fell again in 1977.", "Industry Problems", "The stagnation of the timber industry May be attributed to lower international timber prices, the high cost of production in PNG, and strict government regulations. Papua New Guinea forests contain many different types of hardwoods\u2014in some cases as many as 100 different varieties in a single square mile. Core rot is prevalent. Minimum wage laws and low worker education levels have combined to make PNG a high Labor cost country. As a result of these conditions sawmilling a cubic yard of timber costs $85 as compared to $25 in the United States. Since PNG Government regulations have required a quick transition from export of logs to export of sawn timber, it is easy to comprehend why the timber industry has not prospered.", "Future Prospects", "The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Primary Industry, Julius Chan, has announced upcoming changes in Papua New Guinea's regulations. The changes will encourage greater log exports and will require less construction of social infrastructure on the part of new investors. Some tax breaks will be given to those companies already involved in sawmilling. Though roughly 6 dozen sawmills have closed down in the past 3 years, several are now in various stages of being re-opened under new management. In addition, serious negotiations are under way for major foreign investment in the timber industry. The most immediate is the plan of Hyundai, the Korean firm, to build a multi-million dollar woodchip mill in New Britain. Other projects under serious negotiation include a $2 million logging operation in Manus, a $2.5 million logging operation in the eastern highlands, and a $5-10 million forestry development ", "project ", "in Vanimo near the Irian Jaya border. The Department of Primary Industry is estimating that the new regulations will allow for a tripling of log exports over the next 3 years. This expansion will come partially through greater utilization of existing", "\ncapacity and partially out of additions of new capacity.", "Change in Industry Structure", "If the new regulations take effect as expected, there should be a great increase in the amount of logging. Many companies have found themselves in a position where they could sell logs but not sawn timber. The Government requirement to keep a fixed ratio between the two limited the company's log exports.", "In the meantime, many sawmills are turning inward to local markets. At present most furniture and wood products are still imported despite the great deal of surplus wood left over from sawmilling operations. Local firms are now beginning to build furniture, boxes, furniture parts, etc., and this industry is expected to grow in the next few years. The Government of Papua New Guinea has recently let a tender for a consulting contract to help develop a plan for such an industry in the Central province.", "Source: American Embassy Papua New Guinea report dated August 1978.", "5. Council on Wage and Price Stability Hearings on Building Materials Prices", "The President's Council on Wage and Price Stability held a public hearing in early October to ", "Review ", "rising prices of wood products and other building materials. The purpose of the hearing was to determine the reasons for and solutions to the accelerating housing costs which contribute to general inflation within the U.S. economy. Testimony was presented at the hearing by organizations representing building materials consumers such as the National Association of Home Builders, the National Lumber and Building Materials Dealers, and the U.S. Department of Labor's Chicago Construction Coordinating Committee. The materials producers were represented by the National Forest Products Association and two major wood product manufacturers, Georgia-Pacific Corporation and Weyerhaeuser ", "Company. ", "Others testifying in", "cluded Congressman James Weaver of Oregon and representatives from conservation groups: Sierra Club, National Wildlife Federation, and National Resources Defense Council. Cited as common denominators of price inflation were: (1) ", "cyclical ", "demand ", "which May create supply-demand imbalance resulting in shortages and price increases; (2) ", "general ", "inflation ", "which affects all products and services such as wages, fringe benefits, transportation, machinery and equipment, taxes, and other business operation costs; (3) ", "raw ", "material ", "shortages ", "caused by reduced timber harvests on Federal timberlands and bidding up of stumpage prices (price of the standing tree) which affect lumber; (4) ", "capital ", "investment ", "which is difficult to raise or accumulate due to unattractive profits or profit potential, or tax laws and regulations which May constrain needed replacement, expansion, or modernization of plant equipment; (5) ", "over-expansion ", "in anticipation of continuing strong demand, which May not materialize and which May result in low capacity utilization, and possible closing or dismantling of marginal plants; and (6) ", "government ", "environmental ", "policies, ", "laws, ", "or ", "programs, ", "which materially increase the cost of doing business. Forest industry leaders stated that the best opportunity to increase wood product supply to meet housing and other demands is by making more timber available from the National Forest lands, which hold more than 50 percent of the Nation's inventory of softwood sawtimber. The industry suggested that immediate and near-term needs for expanded production of wood products must be met from the area where timber resources are located and where productionn capacity is underused, which is in the West. It was also suggested that the Government provide appropriate incentives to stimulate investments which would expand production capacity and improve productivity through further technological developments to increase yields from raw materials.

", "VENEZUELA'S MAJOR FORESTRY PROJECTS", "(Excerpted from American Embassy-Caracas Report)", "Summary", "Venezuela has begun a number of large forestry projects to satisfy the fiber requirements of that nation's pulp and paper Mills. Raw material needs are particularly acute with respect to secondary fibers for the paper and board industry, long-fibered pulp for newsprint, and softwood timber for use in the construction industry. The pulp and paper industry is heavily dependent on imports, with 83 percent of all pulp requirements being imported. As these projects reach maturity, opportunities for U.S. businessmen will arise in construction, consulting/engineering, and equipment sales.", "Because of current pulp, short fiber, and timber shortages, Venezuela has embarked on an ambitious planting/development program for Caribbean pine and eucalyptus in the southern Anzoategui and northern Monagas State areas, respectively. The objective is to convert the Sabanas into a gigantic forestry and industry complex capable of supporting several pulp Mills that would not only supply domestic needs but also provide valuable export income. The two major government agencies responsible for these developments are Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) and Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CNR).", "Uverito ", "Project ", "The Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "was begun in 1969 by Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana with the intention of planting 218 million trees on 150,000 hectares by 1985, in order to produce long fiber pulp-mainly for the production of newsprint. Long fiber pulp is currently imported at an annual rate of 80,000 tons. Caribbean pine (Hondurensis), imported from Guatemala and other Central American countries, is the type of tree being planted. To date, about 80 million trees have been planted on 110,000 acres, with an additional 110 million planned for 1984. Plans are being made to harvest trees for pulp production in 1984. Eventually, 4,000 hectares out of every 10,000 will be harvested for pulp, with the remainder being conserved for timber production (maturity: about 10 to 15 years). By 1986, CVG expects to reach the 4,000 hectare level, with an expected yield of 180 cubic meters per hectare. CVG will require forestry equipment and technical assistance for the extraction process.", "In preparation for the harvesting period, CVG has plans to build a pulp mill capable of producing 200,000 tons annually, which should be completed by the 1984 deadline. Decisions on outside equity participation and exact composition have yet to be made, but the mill will be separately managed from the rest of the forestry ", "proj", "ect, and probably will be structured in the manner of other CVG corporations such as SIDOR, VENALUM. and ALCASE. While a feasibility study had been made at the initial conception of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project, ", "it considered tropical woods rather than pines as the basic raw material. A probable timetable for Uverito development is: late 1978-79 for new feasibility studies; 1979-81 for decisions on equity participation; 1981-82 for start of construction; and 1984 for start-up of production.", "CONARE", "Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CONARE) was created in August 1975, with the mandate to take responsibility for Venezuela's forestry industry (excluding Uverito). Under Federal decree No. 1341 of December 16, 1975, CONARE was authorized to incorporate the private sector into Venezuela's forestry programs. While CONARE has several small experimental forests throughout the country, its major area of development is in South Anzoategui and Monagas States, on land owned by the National Agrarian Institute. Here CONARE has about 100,000 hectares which it plans to divide into seven huge blocks and to develop, in conjunction with its Venezuelan and foreign partners, a large Caribbean pine and eucalyptus plantation.", "Companies established by CONARE include: (1) Corporacion Forestal Guayamure, with an area of about 10,000 hectares of Caribbean pine; (2) Forestor, with an area of 75,000 hectares which will be planted to eucalyptus to support a 300,000 ton-year pulp mill; and (3) Corporacion Forestal Sipao S.A., which will plant 18,000 hectares of short-fibered eucalyptus.", "Other Projects", "Corporation Venezolana de Fomento is doing a feasibility study for a bagasse mill at Rio Turbio. Industry", "\nsources are skeptical of this project's success, in part due to water shortages in the area. A ", "project ", "to construct a short fiber mill in Central Portuguesa is also being considered. While no construction has begun, several firms have placed orders for its production.", "Equipment", "With harvesting periods due around 1984, and with initial experimental thinnings already started, the demand for forestry equipment should begin to increase. The manager of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "has already visited the United States to study equipment. The proximity of the United States, which facilitates maintenance, is an important competitive factor.", "In response to the upcoming increases in supply of raw materials there appears to be a new interest in investment in paper machines; several local firms are considering purchases of new machines in the near future. However, industry members are awaiting changes in Government price control policy before making large investments.", "Forestry studies have indicated the need for improved planting methods. Consequently, there should be new purchases of equipment to plant and maintain forests. A Georgia ", "company ", "has already sold quite a few of its semiautomatic transplanters to CONARE, Uverito, and Manpa paper ", "company. ", "Centralized Management", "There has been considerable discussion concerning the placing of Venezuela's forest and pulp industry under one government coordinating agency. Since most of the forestry projects are located in the same area (southern Anzoategui, Monagas, and Uverito) coordination between the entities developing these areas will be required for long-term investments such as pulp Mills. Plans call for a ministerial level commission to coordinate forestry development between Uverito, CONARE, and the private sector. It is reported that the Government is considering consolidating the industry under CONARE'S manageIn ent.", "RECENT DEVELOPMENTS", "1. Newsprint Mill Planned in Australia", "Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd. (ANM) has announced a go-ahead for construction of a A$155 million newsprint mill at Albury, in New South Wales. The New South Wales Government had encouraged the construction of the mill with various incentives, including housing, payroll tax rebates, machinery subsidies, employee training subsidies, and financial assistance in locating key perSonnel.", "The mill will eventually have the capacity to produce 180,000 tons of newsprint a year, raising ANM'S total annual capacity to more than 380,000 tons. More than 90 percent of the raw material furnished would be thermomechanical pulp produced at the mill; the remainder will be imported in the form of bleached sulfate pulp. About 450,000 cubic meters-year of radiata pine is available from about 53,000 hectares of State-owned forest in the area around Albury. ANM presently operates a newsprint mill in Tasmania, and the combined production from both Mills would satisfy about 70 percent of Australia's annual newsprint consumption. This will reduce the country's dependence on imported newsprint\u2014 about 200,000 tons annually, mainly from New ", "Zealand ", "and Canada\u2014and will save about A$70 million in foreign exchange.", "The planning and design of the mill is well under way, and the selection of equipment has reached an advanced", "stage. The ", "project, ", "which is due for completion in 1981, has been welcomed by state and local governments of New South Wales, although there have been some protests from a wide range of community groups, following environmental and economic impact studies on the proposed mill. The ", "project ", "will provide employment for about 800 people during the construction phase, and 650 people when in actual operation. It has been reported that about A-100 million will be borrowed from domestic sources for the ", "project ", "by ANM, with additional capital sought overseas.", "The decision by ANM to construct the new mill at Albury could put the ", "company ", "in direct competition with one of its major shareholders, New Zealand's Tasman Pulp and Paper Co. Ltd., which has a 16 percent stake in ANM (ANM also has a 20 percent share in Tasman Pulp and Paper).

Indonesia: Report on Two Wood-Processing Complexes: P.T. Raja Garuda Mas and the Plywood Oligopoly", "The wood-processing complex of P.T. Raja Garuda Mas is located at Besitong in North Sumatra province near the border with Aceh. Established in 1974, the firm began operations with only a plywood mill but, in the intervening years, has added two sawmill units and a plant which produces wood-cement panels for prefabricated houses.", "In addition to plywood for construction purposes, the facility also turns out decorative veneer for furniture. Most of the equipment in the plywood plant is of Japanese manufacture though there were two large peelers from a U.S. manufacturer, Production Machinery Inc. of Portland, Oregon. Capacity of the plywood operation is 12,000-15,000 sheets (measuring four feet by eight feet, with a thickness of four millimeters) per day. The plant operates 24 hours per day with the exception of 2 days each month when shut down for maintenance.", "Garuda Mas' sawmill units were set up in 1977 to", "19", "comply with an Indonesian Government regulation compelling holders of timber concessions to process logs locally. As at the plywood facility, most of the equipment was imported from Japan.", "Also in 1977, the ", "company ", "began to manufacture wood-cement panels using as raw material the waste from its plywood and sawmill operations. Wood waste is chipped in a hammer mill, and is washed and mixed with cement to produce panels measuring one meter by twenty centimeters, with a thickness of five centimeters. These panels are used principally in the construction of low-cost, prefabricated houses. At present Garuda Mas produces about 3,000 panels per day.", "Garuda Mas obtains its timber from large concessions controlled by the firm in Aceh province, near the town of Idi. Logs are floated down the Besitong River to the plant site on the river bank. The river also serves as the company's inlet for imported raw materials, which are brought in by barge, mainly from Singapore. Most of the finished products are trucked to Medan's port, Belawan, for shipment to Java or abroad.", "P.T. Lontar Papyrus Paper Industry", "Established in 1974, Lontar Papyrus Paper Industry is situated in Aceh province, about twenty kilometers from the town of Langsa. The sole owner of the facility is a Medan resident of Chinese descent. Except for two technicians from Taiwan, the plant is staffed by local Indonesians. Much of the plant's equipment, which appears quite modern, is from Taiwan, though there is some from Japan and West Germany as well. Raw material, in the form of boxed pulp, is imported from the Scandinavian countries, Canada and the United States. Originally, the firm had hoped to procure most of its raw material locally but it discovered that it could obtain only enough wood to operate its chippers at 20 percent capacity. The ", "company ", "now hopes to arrange with one or more local timber companies to obtain the waste wood from logging operations for use in paper production. Lontar has no timber concession of its own. Present capacity of the Lontar operation is 30 tons per day, all of which is marketed in the Medan area. The plant produces paper with tensile strength from 28 to 70 grams. Reportedly, the ", "company ", "has no difficulty in selling all of the paper it makes during its round-the-clock operations.

Most of the increase was in the Appalachian hardwood region which produced 20 percent of the hardwood lumber in the first half of 1978. Actual production in the Appalachian region was 628 million board feet, up 14 percent over last year. In the Southern hardwood region, hardwood lumber production for the same period was 1,457 million board feet, only slightly higher (1 percent) than last year.

Canada purchased 50 percent of U.S. hardwood lumber exports, followed by France 17 percent, West Germany 13 percent, and the Netherlands 8 percent. Therefore, with production at 3,160 million board feet and exports and imports at the above levels, hardwood lumber imports account for 5 percent of domestic hardwood lumber apparent consumption.", "Lighter-colored hardwoods, such as oak, are replacing the once dominant darkwoods, such as walnut, in furniture manufacturing.

Thailand is the major U.S. source of high quality teak, which is still unrivaled in boat deck construction. U.S. importers and boat builders are seeking to persuade the Thai's to reverse their embargo decision.", "Hardwood Plywood", "Hardwood plywood imports for the first half of 1978 were 2,440 million square feet (MMSF-surface measure), 12 percent above the similar period last year. The Republic of Korea was the major supplier at 1,326 MMSF or 53 percent. Taiwan was the next largest supplier at 31 percent, followed by Japan 7 percent, and the Philippines 5 percent. Hardwood plywood with a Philippine mahogany (sometimes called lauan) face accounted for 45 percent of hardwood plywood imports.", "Although monthly production figures for hardwood plywood are not available, yearly figures are published by the Bureau of the Census. In 1977, hardwood plywood production was 1,478 MMSF, an 8 percent increase over 1976. Manufacturers' shipments of hardwood plywood were 1,339 MMSF in 1977, valued at $4.68 million. Imports of hardwood plywood for domestic consumption", "were 4,186 MMSF valued at $429 million in 1977. Therefore, imports as a percent of domestic consumption were 76.5 percent (quantity basis) in 1977. U.S. exports of hardwood plywood were minimal at 4.1 percent of manufacturers' shipments. Manufacturers' shipments of hardwood plywood shipped in the unfinished state (to prefinishers) were 859 MMSF or 64 percent of manufacturers' shipments. The remaining 36 percent was shipped as prefinished; i.e., hardwood plywood manufactured and prefinished in the same establishment. Prefinished hardwood plywood made from purchased plywood was 2,190 MMSF. Purchases were made from domestic and foreign manufacturers. The South Atlantic States produced 44 percent of the quantity of production of veneer core (type II, moisture resistant) hardwood playwood in 1977. Type II, moistureresistant hardwood plywood represented 75 percent of hardwood plywood production in 1977. The Pacific States accounted for 34 percent of production, the East and North Central States 9 percent, the New England and Middle Atlantic States 6 percent. Although the Pacific States supplied 34 percent of production, only 51 percent of net volume of hardwood sawtimber on commercial timberland in the United States is located on the West Coast. Therefore, most of the hardwood plywood produced on the West Coast is dependent on hardwood veneer imports. Hardwood veneer imports in 1977 were 1,703 MMSF, an increase of 7 percent over 1976. In the first 6 months of 1978, imports were 794 MMSF, a decrease of 5 percent over the same period in 1977. Canada was the leading supplier of hardwood veneer to the United States\u2014mostly birch at 401 MMSF or 51 percent of U.S. imports from January\u2013June 1978. The Philippines was the second largest supplier of hardwood veneers to the United States at 188 MMSF or a 24 percent import share; Brazil supplied 85 MMSF or 11 percent; Peru 22 MMSF or 3 percent; and Malaysia, Indonesia, and Taiwan each supplied 1 percent. The Republic of Korea and Taiwan, the two largest suppliers of hardwood plywood to the United States, depend on Southeast Asian countries for their raw material supply\u2014hardwood logs. Japan is also a major importer of Southeast Asian hardwood logs. The supply of hardwood logs from the tropical less-developed countries to these producing countries May undergo major changes in the next two decades. Primarily, major forestry and wood product industry projects in these countries are aimed at developing the forest products industry to an extent that timber harvested would be converted to lumber, plywood, or paper products domestically, and then sold for internal consumption or export. Significant progress in industry development will, however, take some time\u2014at least until the end of the century. More importantly, however, is the alarming", "\nrate of deforestation in the developing countries of South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. At a June 1978 conference in Washington, D.C., private and public officials met to discuss the deforestation problem and its social, environmental, and economic implications for these countries and the world. Deforestration was attributed to (1) the expanding population's need to clear", "land for settlement and agriculture and (2) the extensive use of wood for fuel. While land clearing and settlement are considered as economic progress by the general population, such consequences as erosion, endangering delicate ecosystems, climate changes, and decrease of world wood supply are the results.", "SWEDISH PULP AND PAPER INDUSTRY: 1977 ", "REVIEW ", "AND OUTLOOK", "By the American Embassy in Stockholm", "Summary", "The recession in Sweden's key pulp and paper industry, one of the mainstays of the nation's prosperity and economic stability, continued through calender year 1977. Pulp and paper export prices remained very depressed throughout the year and yielded little or no profit to producers. By year's end, several companies found themselves in a precarious financial situation, and some were on the verge of bankruptcy. However, the ini-tial months of 1978 appeared to mark a turning point not only for Sweden's pulp and paper industry but for the West European industry as well. Economic activity in Western Europe seemed, at long last, to be on the upturn, and this was favorably reflected in a growing demand for pulp and paper. Moreover, the pressure from North American producers has eased in the West European market as a result of the rising demand for pulp and paper at home.", "Around mid-1978, optimism was growing in Sweden's pulp and paper industry. The large pulp inventories built up by Mills during 3 lean years to sustain mill employment have finally been brought down to normal operating levels. The backlog of orders for pulp and paper is increasing, mill operations are being stepped up, and export sales prices are being adjusted upward, though still not enough to compensate producers fully for their growing costs.", "Industry Remained Depressed in 1977", "The year 1977 brought little relief to Sweden's hardhit pulp industry. The total volume of export shipments in that year was no larger than in 1976 due mainly to the unsatisfactory rate of economic activity in Western Europe, which normally takes about 90 percent of Sweden's aggregate pulp exports. Other factors adversely affecting Sweden's pulp export trade were the continued high domestic cost inflation; the unstable currency market, particularly the declining U.S. dollar rate; and the keen competition in Sweden's traditional West European pulp market from North American, notably Canadian, producers. To meet the increasing North American competi. tion, the Swedish pulp industry was forced to make several", "downward price adjustments during 1977, and this occurred at a time when cost inflation at home was at an unprecedented level. This, of course, aggravated the already grave problems confronting Swedish pulp producers, bringing many of them to the verge of bandruptcy.", "The market situation in 1977 called for curtailed operations at many Mills. As a result, the industry as a whole used only 68 percent of its existing productive capacity during the year. A Bright spot in an otherwise cloudy picture was that the industry, largely through production cutbacks and intensive selling efforts in nonEuropean markets, was successful in bringing down mill pulp inventories from the costly and unwieldly level of well over 1.5 million metric tons at the end of 1976 to just over a million tons at the end of 1977. This heavy financial burden on Swedish pulp companies, resulting from previous Government-supported pulp inventory buildups to sustain mill employment, was thus well on the way to being eliminated late in 1977, which augured well for mill production during the months ahead. For data on Swedish production and exports of wood pulp by grade, see figures 1 and 2.", "Only 73 Percent of Capacity Used in 1977", "In terms of capacity utilization, Sweden's paper industry did better than the pulp industry during 1977. Production of paper and paperboard in that year totaled 5.1 million metric tons. This represented a gain of 2.3 percent over 1976 but, due to several new additions to plant facilities, production in 1977 amounted to only 73 percent of the industry's rated productive capacity. A relatively slow growth rate in West European paper and board consumption in conjunction with varying exchange rates and depressed prices were factors adversely affecting developments in Sweden's paper industry. Export shipments, however, were maintained at a relatively satisfactory level, but at prices that yielded little or no profit to producers. Moreover, mill inventories of paper and board continued to accumulate during the year and effectively prevented producers from making any upward adjustments in export or home market prices.", "Sweden's exports of paper and board during 1977 totaled 3.7 million tons, compared to 3.4 million tons in 1976. The increase was attributed mainly to larger shipments of kraft liner, fluting paper, and various grades of", "\nprinting paper. A notable feature was that virtually all of the increase in exports attained during 1977 consisted of paper and board destined to countries outside the European Common Market, mainly to customers in Asia and Africa. For data on Swedish production and export of paper and board, see figures 3 and 4.", "Continued Freeze of EC Paper Ceilings", "Under the import tariff dismantling terms of Sweden's free trade agreement with the European Community (EC), tariffs on paper and board, except newsprint, imported from Sweden were lowered from 10 to 8 percent ad valorem effective July 1, 1977. The tariff dismantling schedule calls for a reduction in EC tariffs on most grades of paper and board from 12 percent in 1973 to zero duty by 1984. The next tariff cut to 6 percent is to be January 1, 1979.", "Eight import ceilings are enforced by the EC for specific categories of paper and board supplied by Sweden. Originally, it was the intention of the EC to raise these ceilings by 5 percent annually. Paper and board imports from Sweden in excess of these ceilings are, in most cases, dutiable at a penalty rate, which is the full rate of 12 percent ad valorem that existed before the free trade agreement was concluded. During 1977, Swedish exporters were obliged to pay penalty rates for exceeding four of the eight import ceilings. Early in 1978 it was announced that the EC, reportedly at the request of some member nations (France and Belgium were specifically mentioned in the Swedish press), had decided on a continued freeze of three ceilings during calendar year 1978. This means that the earlier intended 5 percent increase of those ceilings will not be implemented for the third year in succession. It is noted in this connection that the EC, in 1976, had reached a decision to freeze all eight of its ceilings for imports of Swedish paper and board. This move was taken in retaliation against the imposition in the same year of Swedish import restrictions on shoes.", "Outlook Improves for Pulp and Paper Industry", "The market Outlook for Sweden's pulp and paper industry, which early in 1978 was judged with considerable caution, not to say pessimism, is now generally regarded in industry circles to be improving. The industry foresees an improvement in its overall order book position during the months ahead, especially with respect to export orders. Developments since the end of 1977 indicate that the Western European economy is beginning to show signs of recovery, and although the upturn has been slight, it has already had a favorable effect on activity in Sweden's pulp and paper industry. Moreover, the rising demand for pulp", "and paper in North America is reported by Swedish trades to have eased the price pressure from North American producers in the West European market.", "Swedish pulp and paper industry spokesmen recently stated that they have now, for the first time since 1974, been enabled to make upward adjustments in export prices. This, they say is a welcome development not only because the EC Commission has accused Swedish and other Nordic producers, of dumping their chemical pulp in the EC market, but also because the Swedish industry will now be in a position to reduce somewhat the losses suffered in recent years. Swedish producers attribute their low price policy in the Common Market to the need for competing in prices with North American exporters. Growing demand at home is said to be reducing American and Canadian interest in the West European market. This, in conjunction with a continued sharp reduction in previously unwieldy mill pulp inventories, paved the way for some eagerly awaited improvements in Swedish pulp export prices. After having reduced prices to extremely low levels, the Swedish pulp industry was, at long last, in a position to announce upward price adjustments for export shipments during the third quarter of 1978. For major pulp grades, those prices are the following (per ton, cost, insurance, and freight\u2014c.i.f., West European ports): longfiber bleached sulfate\u2014$340; bleached sulfite\u2014 $325; birchwood pulp\u2014$320. Although these prices are from $15 to $20 higher than those previously quoted, they are still not quite adequate to compensate producers for their rising production costs. According to one industry official, a price of about $380 per ton for most major pulp grades would be needed to give producers what they now regard as a reasonable profit margin.", "According to industry sources, Sweden's pulp industry is expected to step up operations substantially during the second half of 1978 now that the previously large mill pulp inventories have been brought down to normal operating levels. As a result, the rate of capacity utilization in calendar 1978 is expected to average about 80 percent, compared to 68 percent in 1977. Total pulp production (chemical, semi-chemical, and mechanical, except defibrated and exploded pulps entering directly into hardboard and insulation board production) is expected to increase to 8.4 million metric tons in 1978 from 7.7 million tons in 1977, a gain of over 9 percent. This production increase will be made possible largely as the result of a recovery of markets in Western Europe previously lost to North American producers, and of a substantial increase in pulp shipments to Asian countries, notably Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. A rather substantial increase in paper and board production is also predicted. According to industry sources, output in 1978 is", "\nexpected to attain an all-time high and exceed that of 1977 by at least 12 percent.", "1978-83 Expansion Plans", "Despite several lean years, Sweden's pulp and paper industry plans to proceed with its expansion and plant improvement program during the coming 5-year period. This was revealed in a recent study conducted by the Swedish Pulp and Paper Association. The industry, however, has decided to go slow with the implementation of this program during 1978 and has cut back on previously earmarked investment in new plant and equipment for the current year. According to the study, the Swedish pulp industry's present annual capacity totals 1 1.5 million metric tons. This figure includes all grades of wood pulp (both captive and market pulps) but excludes defibrated and exploded pulps used directly for the manufacture of hardboard or insulation board. By 1983, total annual capacity is expected to amount to 12.5 million tons. The industry's present capacity of 11.5 million tons is distributed as follows: chemical pulp, 8.2 million tons; and semi-chemical pulp, 0.5 million tons. There will be little change in this capacity during 1979. As for paper, the industry's present plans call for an overall capacity increase of 1.3 million metric tons, to 8.3 million tons, by 1983. This is equivalent to an average annual increase of 3.5 percent. The industry's present capacity is distributed by major grades as follows: kraft papers, 1.4 million metric tons; newsprint, 1.6 million tons; other printing papers, 1.1 million tons; paperboard, 2.2 million tons (half of paperboard capacity consists of kraft liner); other papers, 0.7 million tons. Of the total planned capacity expansion, almost one million tons will be in paper grades, with the emphasis on newsprint.

The reduction of Special alpha and dissolving pulp production was also influenced by a drop in exports of these grades from 413,000 tons in January\u2013June 1977 to 403,000 for the 1978 period: a drop of 2.4 percent in exports (table S-14).", "The total picture, however, for the pulp producers during January\u2013June 1978 has been one of some improvement.

Growing demand, stemming from the second quarter upturn in the U.S. economy as well as buying by offshore economies, provided added impetus to the 1978 growth of paper and board production. As reported by the Bureau of the Census, U.S. paper and board output in the second quarter totaled 16.3 million tons, a gain of 5.3 percent over the first quarter figure. For the half year, production equalled 30.8 million tons, 3.5 percent higher than the comparable year-ago level. As published by the American Paper Institute, the capacity utilization rates for paper Mills averaged 93.4 percent in the first 6 months of 1978 while those for paperboard Mills averaged 91.9 percent in the same period. Capacity utilization rates in the comparable period a year ago averaged 91.7 percent and 91.1 percent, respectively.

Since the growth pattern emulated that shown in 1977, there was only a small improvement in the comparative 1977-78 half-year totals. Production of the building paper and board components, reflecting the continued high level of construction activity, climbed 8.9 percent higher in the second quarter and amounted to 2.8 million tons for the first half of 1978, a 4.9 percent increase over the first 6 months of 1977. In the paper sector, year-to-year improvements were evident in production of virtually all grades of paper but continued to be centered mainly in the printing and writing papers, which are currently reflecting the expanding demand from the burgeoning magazine industry and continuing growth in overall advertising. As a group, printing and writing paper represents the bulk of all paper output, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total paper output. Production of these papers was up 8.5 percent in the first half of 1978 compared with the similar period in 1977. The other two major paper grade sectors, tissues and coarse papers were up 3.1 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. Preliminary reports on second quarter production of some paper grades such as newsprint, coated two-sides printing papers, bristols, and the bag and sack papers, indicated lower second quarter output.

This was an 11 percent increase over the same period in 1977. Actual starts of residential construction for the first 6 months showed 986,400 starts, an increase of 4.0 percent. Single family dwellings comprised 72 percent of the total housing starts, compared to 75 percent a year earlier. The percent of single family starts is a key indicator for solid wood product demand since more lumber and plywood are used in single family construction than in multiple unit construction. In general, common walls and use of substitute materials such as brick and block in multi-family construction reduce the amount of structural wood products used.", "Lumber", "For the first 6 months of 1978, production, shipments, and orders received of softwood lumber were running slightly less than the same period in 1977.

The reduced levels of production and orders of softwood lumber during such a high rate of demand possibly reflect the severe winter weather over the first part of the year, reducing logging operations and construction activity, and the anticipation by lumber wholesalers that housing demand\u2014thus lumber demand\u2014will taper off by the end of 1978.", "Specifically, softwood lumber production in the southern pine region for the first 6 months of 1978 was essentially the same as in 1977; the Douglas fir region showed a 4.8 percent increase in production; the western pine region a 4.0 percent decrease; the California redwood region, a 6.3 percent decrease, and other softwood regions at virtually the same pace.

Freight rates on the Nation's rail lines from the Pacific Northwest to the northeastern consuming regions are, according to industry sources, becoming cost prohibitive. The southern producing region (basically the southeastern States) has an increasing advantage in the freight proportion of the lumber costs to the northeastern wholesaler. Also, various sources indicate that the Pacific Northwest producers are directing sales to western markets and export. U.S. exports of softwood lumber to all countries for the first six months of 1978 were 703 million board feet, a 12 percent decrease from the same period last year. Japan and Canada were the two leading purchasers of U.S. softwood lumber, buying 203 and 193 million board feet, respectively. These two countries purchased 56 percent of U.S. lumber exports.

Exports of softwood plywood of 176 million square feet were running slightly less than the volume exported by mid-year 1977. The major drop in total volume of softwood plywood exports from 1976 to 1977 of 60 percent was due in major part, to (1) the increase in domestic demand for softwood plywood in 1977-78, (2) the Canadian resolution of Labor disputes in their forest products industry, and (3) the devaluation of the Canadian dollar. Also, the strong market for U.S. plywood in Canada in 1976 quickly diminished in 1977.

Semi-chemical pulp production also Fell slightly, from 2.1 million tons to 2.0 million tons for 1978. The production of corrugating medium, based on this pulp, Fell; while the use of wastepapers in a combination furnished medium increased (table S-5). This increased use of wastepaper in combination medium furnishes, especially old corrugated, is reflected in the wastepaper consumption data, by grade (table S-2). Old corrugated consumption at the user Mills, at 2.5 million tons, grew 460,000 tons or 17 percent over 1977 six-month consumption figures.", "The production of Special alpha and dissolving pulps dropped slightly from 1977 figures (table S-3). This is reflected in the 8 percent reduced consumption of those grades (table S-5) at the non-paper Mills, where producers of rayon fibers, cellophane and related chemical-converted pulp-based products are being steadily challenged in the market by other man-made fibers, filaments and films. The reduction of Special alpha and dissolving pulp production was also influenced by a drop in exports of these grades from 413,000 tons in January\u2013June 1977 to 403,000 for the 1978 period: a drop of 2.4 percent in exports (table S-14).", "The total picture, however, for the pulp producers during January\u2013June 1978 has been one of some improvement. The estimated final 1978 pulp production figure, at 51.3 million tons, will be an all-time record high; close to 2.5 percent above 1977 production. This improvement is geared to the 2.7 percent growth in paper and board production (table S-6).", "Paper and Board", "Preliminary data on paper and board apparent consumption (production + imports - exports) sets the quantity at 34.5 million tons for the January\u2013June 1978 period, a record rate. The second quarter rate of 16.8 million tons was 5.3 percent greater than that reported for the first quarter. The relationship of consumption to real GNP in 1978 (a commonly used measure) exceeds the norm and introduces the possibility of inventory accumulation as a factor for the variance. Inventories May have been built as", "\na hedge against possible paper industry strikes. Growing demand, stemming from the second quarter upturn in the U.S. economy as well as buying by offshore economies, provided added impetus to the 1978 growth of paper and board production. As reported by the Bureau of the Census, U.S. paper and board output in the second quarter totaled 16.3 million tons, a gain of 5.3 percent over the first quarter figure. For the half year, production equalled 30.8 million tons, 3.5 percent higher than the comparable year-ago level. As published by the American Paper Institute, the capacity utilization rates for paper Mills averaged 93.4 percent in the first 6 months of 1978 while those for paperboard Mills averaged 91.9 percent in the same period. Capacity utilization rates in the comparable period a year ago averaged 91.7 percent and 91.1 percent, respectively. Production of the paper grades, which amounted to 7.4 million tons in the second quarter, was up 2.3 percent over the first quarter figure and totaled 14.6 million tons for the first 6 months of the year, a 5.9 percent increase over the comparable 1977 period. Reflecting sharp gains in the nondurables sector and a pickup in export trade, the packaging-oriented paperboard segment showed a ", "7.7 ", "percent favorable quarter-to-quarter change and totaled 14.3 million tons in the January\u2013June period. Since the growth pattern emulated that shown in 1977, there was only a small improvement in the comparative 1977-78 half-year totals. Production of the building paper and board components, reflecting the continued high level of construction activity, climbed 8.9 percent higher in the second quarter and amounted to 2.8 million tons for the first half of 1978, a 4.9 percent increase over the first 6 months of 1977. In the paper sector, year-to-year improvements were evident in production of virtually all grades of paper but continued to be centered mainly in the printing and writing papers, which are currently reflecting the expanding demand from the burgeoning magazine industry and continuing growth in overall advertising. As a group, printing and writing paper represents the bulk of all paper output, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total paper output. Production of these papers was up 8.5 percent in the first half of 1978 compared with the similar period in 1977. The other two major paper grade sectors, tissues and coarse papers were up 3.1 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. Preliminary reports on second quarter production of some paper grades such as newsprint, coated two-sides printing papers, bristols, and the bag and sack papers, indicated lower second quarter output. Paperboard production finished the second quarter on the upbeat with a notable trend in the quickening tempo of linerboard production. Production of linerboard, the bedrock for the industry, increased 6.6 percent in the", "second quarter and totaled 6.8 million tons for the half year. Annualized, the second quarter rate would represent record production levels. Output of the combination paperboard grades, which use wastepaper as the major fiber source, moved up in the second quarter but finished the half year only 1.6 percent higher than the same period a year ago. Production of the bleached paperboard grades showed a comparative year-to-year decline of 14 percent as a strong second quarter performance, particularly in milk carton stock, was unable to offset a poor first quarter output and a similar strong second quarter showing a year ago. Second quarter production of the building paper and board grades was 8.7 percent higher than the first quarter total. Output of building papers, amounting to 1,006 thousand tons, represented a 13.8 percent improvement over the comparable 6-month period in 1977.", "Imports Up Markedly", "Aside from higher newsprint imports, which tradi-tionally amount to more than 60 percent of the total U.S. requirement of newsprint, imports in the past 2 years have been expanded because of higher domestic demand for printing papers, particularly coated lightweight magazine paper which is in tight supply in the United States. For the first 6 months of the year, import tonnage of all paper, board and converted products totaled 4.6 million tons, up 25.5 percent over the similar period in 1977. The value of imports, totaling $1.4 billion, was up by 25 percent over the first 6 months of 1977. Second quarter imports, climbing further, were up 16.5 percent over the first quarter total.", "Most of the paper and board imports are in the form of printing paper. Newsprint imports, which dropped in relative importance, still represent 85 percent of the total paper and board imports. In the first half of 1978, imports of newsprint, and uncoated and coated printing papers accounted for 91.5 percent of all paper and board products, with building paper and board accounting for an additional 5 percent.", "Newsprint imports which totaled 3.7 million tons in the January\u2013June period were up by 16.4 percent over the total recorded in the same period in 1977. Second quarter newsprint imports were up 14.8 percent over the first quarter figure. Uncoated printing papers, other than newsprint, totaled 346,000 tons in the first half of 1978 and showed a second quarter gain of 23 percent. Coated printing paper imports approached 140,000 tons in the first 6 months of 1978, and were up 11.8 percent in the second quarter. Imports of building paper and board, reflective of the strong demand engendered by heightened building activity in the United States totaled 250,200 tons, a 75 percent increase over last year's level for the same 6-month period.", "Exports Move Up in Second Quarter", "Export volume of paper, board and converted products totaled 942,000 tons in the second quarter, which represented a 13.9 percent increase over the depressed first quarter shipments to foreign markets. Overall, exports were up 6.6 percent in the first half of the year; however, year-to-year declines still were evident in the paper grades. As a result, exports of the primary paper and board grades were up only a modest 1.6 percent in the first half of the year despite a sharp gain (12.2 percent) in the second quarter.", "Exports of the primary paperboard products, which amounted to 1,155,000 tons for the first 6 months of 1978, were up 10.7 percent in the second quarter and 8.3 percent when compared to the first half of 1977. Linerboard trade, normally the key to the industry's export performance, finished the half year at a reported 804,000 tons, up 8.9 percent over the similar period in 1977 but below the past 10-year average. A firming woodpulp market, disrupted since 1975 by massive producer-held inventories and improving European economies, points toward improvement in second half linerboard exports.", "Exports of Special foodboard continued to grow, climbing 35.9 percent over the first quarter tonnage. First", "half exports of Special foodboard were reported to be 169,900 tons setting the stage for another record-breaking year. While markets are maturing for bleached boards in the United States, exports of this Commodity, destined for countries with changing modes of food distribution and climbing living standards, have grown at an average annual rate of 18.1 percent since 1967. Converted paper and board products, a relatively fast growing export segment over the past 5 years, moved up only modestly in the second quarter. However, for the half year, converted products totaled 168,000 tons, up 51.2 percent over the reported half-year figure for 1977.", "Prices Up Moderately", "Paper prices overall, as measured by the Producer Price Index (former Wholesale Price Index), rose a modest 4.2 percent in the January\u2013June period. Paperboard prices were up 4.4 percent and converted product prices were up only 2.9 percent during the 6-month period. Building board prices, directly influenced by the strong demand, were up 12.7 percent in the January\u2013June period. In comparison, average prices for all industrial commodities in the first half of 1978 rose 2.1 percent.", "COMMODITY TRENDS: SOLID WOOD PRODUCTS January-June 1977-78", "By David K. Henry", "Softwood Products", "Demand for softwood solid wood products was off to a brisk pace in the first half of 1978 as U.S. housing starts, on a seasonally adjusted annual basis for the second quarter of this year, was over the two million mark (a 2,114,000 average). This was an 11 percent increase over the same period in 1977. Actual starts of residential construction for the first 6 months showed 986,400 starts, an increase of 4.0 percent. Single family dwellings comprised 72 percent of the total housing starts, compared to 75 percent a year earlier. The percent of single family starts is a key indicator for solid wood product demand since more lumber and plywood are used in single family construction than in multiple unit construction. In general, common walls and use of substitute materials such as brick and block in multi-family construction reduce the amount of structural wood products used.", "Lumber", "For the first 6 months of 1978, production, shipments, and orders received of softwood lumber were running slightly less than the same period in 1977. Production of softwood lumber was less than half of one percent below the first half of 1977, while shipments were 1 percent less and orders received were about 2 1/2 percent less. The reduced levels of production and orders of softwood lumber during such a high rate of demand possibly reflect the severe winter weather over the first part of the year, reducing logging operations and construction activity, and the anticipation by lumber wholesalers that housing demand\u2014thus lumber demand\u2014will taper off by the end of 1978.", "Specifically, softwood lumber production in the southern pine region for the first 6 months of 1978 was essentially the same as in 1977; the Douglas fir region showed a 4.8 percent increase in production; the western pine region a 4.0 percent decrease; the California redwood region, a 6.3 percent decrease, and other softwood regions at virtually the same pace. The southern pine region produced 26 percent of the total softwood lumber for January\u2013June 1978; 30 percent for the Douglas fir region, 31 percent for the western pine region, and 7.3 percent for the California redwood region. Therefore, the Pacific Northwest continues to produce the majority of the softwood lumber needs for the domestic and export market. However, indications are that the direction of", "flow of softwood lumber from the Southern and Pacific Northwest-producing region are changing. Freight rates on the Nation's rail lines from the Pacific Northwest to the northeastern consuming regions are, according to industry sources, becoming cost prohibitive. The southern producing region (basically the southeastern States) has an increasing advantage in the freight proportion of the lumber costs to the northeastern wholesaler. Also, various sources indicate that the Pacific Northwest producers are directing sales to western markets and export. U.S. exports of softwood lumber to all countries for the first six months of 1978 were 703 million board feet, a 12 percent decrease from the same period last year. Japan and Canada were the two leading purchasers of U.S. softwood lumber, buying 203 and 193 million board feet, respectively. These two countries purchased 56 percent of U.S. lumber exports. Australian purchases ranked third at 68 million board feet and Italy ranked fourth at 58 million board feet. Douglas fir lumber was the major softwood lumber export item at 244 million board feet; hemlock was at 144 million board feet; southern pine at 68 million board feet; and spruce at 60 million board feet.", "Logs", "U.S. softwood log exports, primarily from the Pacific Northwest, were 11.4 percent greater for the first 6 months of 1978 compared to the like period in 1977. Total export volume of softwood logs was 1,718 million board feet. Japan purchased 78 percent of U.S. softwood log exports. The Republic of Korea (South Korea) increased its U.S. softwood log purchases by 250 percent in the first 6 months of 1978 over the same period in 1977, to 225 million board feet or 13 percent of the export volume. Industry sources indicate that Korea's purchases of U.S. softwood logs are ultimately consumed by (1) the domestic market, and (2) the export market, to either Europe or Japan. The lower wage rates of the Korean forest products industry allow these products to be exported competitively with the United States.", "Imports of U.S. softwood sawtimber logs were virtually negligible in comparison to consumption at 41 million board feet, for the first 6 months of 1978. Practically all U.S. imports of softwood logs come from Canada. Canada regulates the export of unprocessed softwood logs with the intent to export only softwood logs that are in excess supply of domestic demand. The United", "\nStates prohibits the export of softwood logs from Federal lands (basically National Forest lands), but does not prohibit export of logs from State and private lands. Softwood log exports have been controversial in the United States, especially during high domestic demand cycles.", "Lumber Imports", "Imports of softwood lumber, on the other hand, consistute a significant proportion of U.S. consumption of that item. For the first 6 months of 1978, Softwood lumber imports amounted to 5,578 million board feet, an increase of 12 percent over the same period last year. Canada continues to dominate the import share with 99 percent of total U.S. purchases of softwood lumber. In the first 6 months of 1978 imports accounted for 27 percent of apparent U.S. domestic consumption. For the first half of 1977, imports of softwood lumber accounted for 25 percent of apparent domestic consumption. The devaluation of the Canadian dollar, low Canadian raw material costs, and relatively cheap transportation, especially from Bri-tish Columbia to eastern U.S. markets, have helped the Canadian exporters market their softwood products in this country.", "Plywood", "Softwood plywood production for the first 6 months of 1978 was 10,157 million board feet (3/8-inch basis), a 2 percent increase over the like period in 1977. Shipments of softwood plywood ran slightly less, however, Orders received were 1 percent greater for the first 6 months of this year over the like period last year. Exports of softwood plywood of 176 million square feet were running slightly less than the volume exported by mid-year 1977. The major drop in total volume of softwood plywood exports from 1976 to 1977 of 60 percent was due in major part, to (1) the increase in domestic demand for softwood plywood in 1977-78, (2) the Canadian resolution of Labor disputes in their forest products industry, and (3) the devaluation of the Canadian dollar. Also, the strong market for U.S. plywood in Canada in 1976 quickly diminished in 1977. Imports of softwood plywood are virtually negligible as a part of domestic consumption at 18 million square feet for the first 6 months of this year, and represent less than one-half of one percent of the apparent domestic consumption of softwood plywood.", "Softwood Prices", "Softwood lumber Producers Price Index (PPI\u2014formerly Wholesale Price Index) increased 22 percent from", "June 1977 to June 1978, and increased 16 percent from December 1977 to June of this year. The relatively high price increases of lumber and plywood compared to the \u201call commodities\u201d index led to President Carter\u2019s remark in his April 11, 1978, anti-inflation message that directed the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Council on Environmental Quality to find ways to increase timber sales from Federal lands. Increased timber sales from National Forests would, hopefully, ease supply price pressures on lumber and wood products. Another issue that would potentially affect timber sales volume, is the Road less Area ", "Review ", "and Evaluation (RARE II). About 62 million acres of roadless and undeveloped National Forest land are being reviewed under RARE II for the completion of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The RARE II process of land-use planning should be completed by the end of 1978. The industry points to the 26.5 million acres of commerical forest land being reviewed under RARE II as a necessary timber source to meet the projected rising demand for timber products until the end of the century.", "Other softwood product PPI'S in June 1978 were millwork at 244.9, a 27 percent increase over June 1977; softwood plywood at 236.0, a 16 percent increase over June 1977; and softwood veneer at 249.1 (1971=100), a 36 percent increase over last year.", "The current housing boom was the key factor in price increases to above a 20 percent level in the 1-year period. However, the increasing cost of raw material (the softwood log) to the primary producers of softwood products over the past several years is also an important factor influencing price increases. For instance, U.S. Forest Service statistics show that Douglas fir peeler (used for veneer and eventually plywood) log prices increased on the average from 1971 to 1977 about 19 percent each year to around $300 per thousand board feet. In 1971, Douglas fir peeler logs were selling at $128 per thousand. Douglas fir sawtimber log prices showed an average annual increase of 23.4 percent from 1971 to 1977 or a total of 163.5 percent in the 7-year period. The average price of all grades of Douglas fir sawtimber logs in 1977 was about $227 per MBF.", "Prices quoted are for water and inland sales used in domestic consumption. Export sales have generally been at considerably higher prices than domestic sales. In 1977, the price differential between domestic and export log sales was about $85 per thousand board feet for Douglas fir peeler logs, due partly to the higher grade of peeler logs sold for export.", "Hardwoods", "Hardwood lumber production for the first 6 months of 1978 was 3,160 million board feet, about a 5 percent", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "My library", "Books on Google Play", "Table S-14.\u2014U.S. Exports of Pulpwood, Paper Base Stocks, Paper, Board, and Converted Products, 1976-78\u2013Continued", "[Short tons, except as noted]", "January\u2013March January\u2013June January\u2013September January-December Commodity 1976 1978 1977 1978 1977 1978 1977 1978 1977 Paperboard, (except wet machine and construction board), total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 548,104 495,075 | 1,154,919 | 1,065,632 1,679,986 2,129,431 2,141,967 Container board, total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 398,218 335,108 804,522 738,808 1,167,589 1,476,533 1,474,642 Liners . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 385,914 326,702 776,951 713,971 1,133,558 1,428,032 1,419,367 Corrugating material\" . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

", "VENEZUELA'S MAJOR FORESTRY PROJECTS", "(Excerpted from American Embassy-Caracas Report)", "Summary", "Venezuela has begun a number of large forestry projects to satisfy the fiber requirements of that nation's pulp and paper Mills. Raw material needs are particularly acute with respect to secondary fibers for the paper and board industry, long-fibered pulp for newsprint, and softwood timber for use in the construction industry. The pulp and paper industry is heavily dependent on imports, with 83 percent of all pulp requirements being imported. As these projects reach maturity, opportunities for U.S. businessmen will arise in construction, consulting/engineering, and equipment sales.", "Because of current pulp, short fiber, and timber shortages, Venezuela has embarked on an ambitious planting/development program for Caribbean pine and eucalyptus in the southern Anzoategui and northern Monagas State areas, respectively. The objective is to convert the Sabanas into a gigantic forestry and industry complex capable of supporting several pulp Mills that would not only supply domestic needs but also provide valuable export income. The two major government agencies responsible for these developments are Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) and Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CNR).", "Uverito ", "Project ", "The Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "was begun in 1969 by Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana with the intention of planting 218 million trees on 150,000 hectares by 1985, in order to produce long fiber pulp-mainly for the production of newsprint. Long fiber pulp is currently imported at an annual rate of 80,000 tons. Caribbean pine (Hondurensis), imported from Guatemala and other Central American countries, is the type of tree being planted. To date, about 80 million trees have been planted on 110,000 acres, with an additional 110 million planned for 1984. Plans are being made to harvest trees for pulp production in 1984. Eventually, 4,000 hectares out of every 10,000 will be harvested for pulp, with the remainder being conserved for timber production (maturity: about 10 to 15 years). By 1986, CVG expects to reach the 4,000 hectare level, with an expected yield of 180 cubic meters per hectare. CVG will require forestry equipment and technical assistance for the extraction process.", "In preparation for the harvesting period, CVG has plans to build a pulp mill capable of producing 200,000 tons annually, which should be completed by the 1984 deadline. Decisions on outside equity participation and exact composition have yet to be made, but the mill will be separately managed from the rest of the forestry ", "proj", "ect, and probably will be structured in the manner of other CVG corporations such as SIDOR, VENALUM. and ALCASE. While a feasibility study had been made at the initial conception of the Uverito Forestry ", "Project, ", "it considered tropical woods rather than pines as the basic raw material.

Under Federal decree No. 1341 of December 16, 1975, CONARE was authorized to incorporate the private sector into Venezuela's forestry programs. While CONARE has several small experimental forests throughout the country, its major area of development is in South Anzoategui and Monagas States, on land owned by the National Agrarian Institute. Here CONARE has about 100,000 hectares which it plans to divide into seven huge blocks and to develop, in conjunction with its Venezuelan and foreign partners, a large Caribbean pine and eucalyptus plantation.", "Companies established by CONARE include: (1) Corporacion Forestal Guayamure, with an area of about 10,000 hectares of Caribbean pine; (2) Forestor, with an area of 75,000 hectares which will be planted to eucalyptus to support a 300,000 ton-year pulp mill; and (3) Corporacion Forestal Sipao S.A., which will plant 18,000 hectares of short-fibered eucalyptus.", "Other Projects", "Corporation Venezolana de Fomento is doing a feasibility study for a bagasse mill at Rio Turbio.

More than 90 percent of the raw material furnished would be thermomechanical pulp produced at the mill; the remainder will be imported in the form of bleached sulfate pulp. About 450,000 cubic meters-year of radiata pine is available from about 53,000 hectares of State-owned forest in the area around Albury. ANM presently operates a newsprint mill in Tasmania, and the combined production from both Mills would satisfy about 70 percent of Australia's annual newsprint consumption. This will reduce the country's dependence on imported newsprint\u2014 about 200,000 tons annually, mainly from New ", "Zealand ", "and Canada\u2014and will save about A$70 million in foreign exchange.", "The planning and design of the mill is well under way, and the selection of equipment has reached an advanced", "stage. The ", "project, ", "which is due for completion in 1981, has been welcomed by state and local governments of New South Wales, although there have been some protests from a wide range of community groups, following environmental and economic impact studies on the proposed mill.

As at the plywood facility, most of the equipment was imported from Japan.", "Also in 1977, the ", "company ", "began to manufacture wood-cement panels using as raw material the waste from its plywood and sawmill operations. Wood waste is chipped in a hammer mill, and is washed and mixed with cement to produce panels measuring one meter by twenty centimeters, with a thickness of five centimeters. These panels are used principally in the construction of low-cost, prefabricated houses. At present Garuda Mas produces about 3,000 panels per day.", "Garuda Mas obtains its timber from large concessions controlled by the firm in Aceh province, near the town of Idi. Logs are floated down the Besitong River to the plant site on the river bank.

Much of the plant's equipment, which appears quite modern, is from Taiwan, though there is some from Japan and West Germany as well.

Lontar's plant is located on a river which, at high tide, can accommodate barges of up to 1,500 tons. These barges, which at present bring imported raw materials for the plant, will, after the expansion, be used to ship finished products to Java. Shipments to Medan will continue to go by truck. Investment in the plant to date is calculated at U.S. $3 million. With the expansion of facilities contemplated, that investment will almost double. In addition to the domestic market, Garuda Mas sells significant quantities overseas. Sawtimber is exported to the United States, the Netherlands and Singapore, while railroad crossties are sold to Belgium. Limited quantities of plywood have been sent to the United Kingdom, where it passes rugged British quality standards. The major market for plywood, however, is Indonesia itself, particularly Java. Domestic plywood prices are often as much as 50 percent above prevailing world market levels. Demand is strong and shows no signs of slackening. To service its clients on Java, Garuda Mas maintains a sales office in Jakarta. It has also recently appointed a firm in Surabaya to handle distribution in Eastern Indonesia. Garuda Mas' Medan office will soon move to a new five-story structure in the heart of the city. The firm, which employs 1,900 persons, is entirely under the control of five brothers of Chinese extraction who reside in Medan. Source: American Embassy Indonesia report dated August 1978.", "4. Papua New Guinea: Timber Industry Expansion Underway", "Papua New Guinea has the potential of being one of", "the giants of the southeast Asian timber industries. It is second only to Indonesia in total forest area and a close third (after Malaysia) in readily harvestable acreage. Permits have been issued to harvest up to 1 million hectares", "of forest area, and an additional 1.2 million hectares of", "timber rights are available for leasing by developers. Another 8 million hectares is capable of being logged but timber rights would have to be negotiated with local owners. Papua New Guinea (PNG) has a total wood processing industry of 130 factories including 90 sawmills, one plywood mill, three veneer Mills and one woodchip mill. The industry employs 4,000 people, pays about $7 million per year in wages, and has a total investment of $42 million in land, buildings and plants. The industry currently earns about US $3 million in exports, or about 4 percent of total National export earn", "ings. Markets for these products are in Japan and Australia while Korea, Taiwan, and the Netherlands are beginning to buy some timber products. The industry also provides an estimated 60,000 cubic meters of sawn timber and 3,600 cubic meters of plywood for local consumption. The value of the locally consumed timber is US $24 million. The PNG Forestry Industry grew rapidly until about 1973-74 when world prices Fell. In 1974-75 two very large sawmills started operation; but despite this, total production Fell dramatically in 1974 and 1975. Production picked up in 1976 but Fell again in 1977.", "Industry Problems", "The stagnation of the timber industry May be attributed to lower international timber prices, the high cost of production in PNG, and strict government regulations. Papua New Guinea forests contain many different types of hardwoods\u2014in some cases as many as 100 different varieties in a single square mile. Core rot is prevalent. Minimum wage laws and low worker education levels have combined to make PNG a high Labor cost country. As a result of these conditions sawmilling a cubic yard of timber costs $85 as compared to $25 in the United States. Since PNG Government regulations have required a quick transition from export of logs to export of sawn timber, it is easy to comprehend why the timber industry has not prospered.", "Future Prospects", "The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Primary Industry, Julius Chan, has announced upcoming changes in Papua New Guinea's regulations. The changes will encourage greater log exports and will require less construction of social infrastructure on the part of new investors. Some tax breaks will be given to those companies already involved in sawmilling. Though roughly 6 dozen sawmills have closed down in the past 3 years, several are now in various stages of being re-opened under new management. In addition, serious negotiations are under way for major foreign investment in the timber industry. The most immediate is the plan of Hyundai, the Korean firm, to build a multi-million dollar woodchip mill in New Britain. Other projects under serious negotiation include a $2 million logging operation in Manus, a $2.5 million logging operation in the eastern highlands, and a $5-10 million forestry development ", "project ", "in Vanimo near the Irian Jaya border. The Department of Primary Industry is estimating that the new regulations will allow for a tripling of log exports over the next 3 years. This expansion will come partially through greater utilization of existing", "\ncapacity and partially out of additions of new capacity.", "Change in Industry Structure", "If the new regulations take effect as expected, there should be a great increase in the amount of logging. Many companies have found themselves in a position where they could sell logs but not sawn timber. The Government requirement to keep a fixed ratio between the two limited the company's log exports.", "In the meantime, many sawmills are turning inward to local markets. At present most furniture and wood products are still imported despite the great deal of surplus wood left over from sawmilling operations. Local firms are now beginning to build furniture, boxes, furniture parts, etc., and this industry is expected to grow in the next few years. The Government of Papua New Guinea has recently let a tender for a consulting contract to help develop a plan for such an industry in the Central province.", "Source: American Embassy Papua New Guinea report dated August 1978.", "5. Council on Wage and Price Stability Hearings on Building Materials Prices", "The President's Council on Wage and Price Stability held a public hearing in early October to ", "Review ", "rising prices of wood products and other building materials. The purpose of the hearing was to determine the reasons for and solutions to the accelerating housing costs which contribute to general inflation within the U.S. economy. Testimony was presented at the hearing by organizations representing building materials consumers such as the National Association of Home Builders, the National Lumber and Building Materials Dealers, and the U.S. Department of Labor's Chicago Construction Coordinating Committee. The materials producers were represented by the National Forest Products Association and two major wood product manufacturers, Georgia-Pacific Corporation and Weyerhaeuser ", "Company. ", "Others testifying in", "cluded Congressman James Weaver of Oregon and representatives from conservation groups: Sierra Club, National Wildlife Federation, and National Resources Defense Council. Cited as common denominators of price inflation were: (1) ", "cyclical ", "demand ", "which May create supply-demand imbalance resulting in shortages and price increases; (2) ", "general ", "inflation ", "which affects all products and services such as wages, fringe benefits, transportation, machinery and equipment, taxes, and other business operation costs; (3) ", "raw ", "material ", "shortages ", "caused by reduced timber harvests on Federal timberlands and bidding up of stumpage prices (price of the standing tree) which affect lumber; (4) ", "capital ", "investment ", "which is difficult to raise or accumulate due to unattractive profits or profit potential, or tax laws and regulations which May constrain needed replacement, expansion, or modernization of plant equipment; (5) ", "over-expansion ", "in anticipation of continuing strong demand, which May not materialize and which May result in low capacity utilization, and possible closing or dismantling of marginal plants; and (6) ", "government ", "environmental ", "policies, ", "laws, ", "or ", "programs, ", "which materially increase the cost of doing business. Forest industry leaders stated that the best opportunity to increase wood product supply to meet housing and other demands is by making more timber available from the National Forest lands, which hold more than 50 percent of the Nation's inventory of softwood sawtimber. The industry suggested that immediate and near-term needs for expanded production of wood products must be met from the area where timber resources are located and where productionn capacity is underused, which is in the West. It was also suggested that the Government provide appropriate incentives to stimulate investments which would expand production capacity and improve productivity through further technological developments to increase yields from raw materials.

Lontar's plant is located on a river which, at high tide, can accommodate barges of up to 1,500 tons. These barges, which at present bring imported raw materials for the plant, will, after the expansion, be used to ship finished products to Java. Shipments to Medan will continue to go by truck. Investment in the plant to date is calculated at U.S. $3 million. With the expansion of facilities contemplated, that investment will almost double. In addition to the domestic market, Garuda Mas sells significant quantities overseas. Sawtimber is exported to the United States, the Netherlands and Singapore, while railroad crossties are sold to Belgium. Limited quantities of plywood have been sent to the United Kingdom, where it passes rugged British quality standards. The major market for plywood, however, is Indonesia itself, particularly Java. Domestic plywood prices are often as much as 50 percent above prevailing world market levels. Demand is strong and shows no signs of slackening. To service its clients on Java, Garuda Mas maintains a sales office in Jakarta. It has also recently appointed a firm in Surabaya to handle distribution in Eastern Indonesia. Garuda Mas' Medan office will soon move to a new five-story structure in the heart of the city. The firm, which employs 1,900 persons, is entirely under the control of five brothers of Chinese extraction who reside in Medan. Source: American Embassy Indonesia report dated August 1978.", "4.

Papua New Guinea (PNG) has a total wood processing industry of 130 factories including 90 sawmills, one plywood mill, three veneer Mills and one woodchip mill. The industry employs 4,000 people, pays about $7 million per year in wages, and has a total investment of $42 million in land, buildings and plants. The industry currently earns about US $3 million in exports, or about 4 percent of total National export earn", "ings. Markets for these products are in Japan and Australia while Korea, Taiwan, and the Netherlands are beginning to buy some timber products. The industry also provides an estimated 60,000 cubic meters of sawn timber and 3,600 cubic meters of plywood for local consumption. The value of the locally consumed timber is US $24 million. The PNG Forestry Industry grew rapidly until about 1973-74 when world prices Fell. In 1974-75 two very large sawmills started operation; but despite this, total production Fell dramatically in 1974 and 1975. Production picked up in 1976 but Fell again in 1977.", "Industry Problems", "The stagnation of the timber industry May be attributed to lower international timber prices, the high cost of production in PNG, and strict government regulations. Papua New Guinea forests contain many different types of hardwoods\u2014in some cases as many as 100 different varieties in a single square mile. Core rot is prevalent. Minimum wage laws and low worker education levels have combined to make PNG a high Labor cost country. As a result of these conditions sawmilling a cubic yard of timber costs $85 as compared to $25 in the United States. Since PNG Government regulations have required a quick transition from export of logs to export of sawn timber, it is easy to comprehend why the timber industry has not prospered.", "Future Prospects", "The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Primary Industry, Julius Chan, has announced upcoming changes in Papua New Guinea's regulations. The changes will encourage greater log exports and will require less construction of social infrastructure on the part of new investors. Some tax breaks will be given to those companies already involved in sawmilling. Though roughly 6 dozen sawmills have closed down in the past 3 years, several are now in various stages of being re-opened under new management. In addition, serious negotiations are under way for major foreign investment in the timber industry. The most immediate is the plan of Hyundai, the Korean firm, to build a multi-million dollar woodchip mill in New Britain. Other projects under serious negotiation include a $2 million logging operation in Manus, a $2.5 million logging operation in the eastern highlands, and a $5-10 million forestry development ", "project ", "in Vanimo near the Irian Jaya border. The Department of Primary Industry is estimating that the new regulations will allow for a tripling of log exports over the next 3 years. This expansion will come partially through greater utilization of existing", "\ncapacity and partially out of additions of new capacity.", "Change in Industry Structure", "If the new regulations take effect as expected, there should be a great increase in the amount of logging. Many companies have found themselves in a position where they could sell logs but not sawn timber. The Government requirement to keep a fixed ratio between the two limited the company's log exports.", "In the meantime, many sawmills are turning inward to local markets. At present most furniture and wood products are still imported despite the great deal of surplus wood left over from sawmilling operations. Local firms are now beginning to build furniture, boxes, furniture parts, etc., and this industry is expected to grow in the next few years. The Government of Papua New Guinea has recently let a tender for a consulting contract to help develop a plan for such an industry in the Central province.", "Source: American Embassy Papua New Guinea report dated August 1978.", "5. Council on Wage and Price Stability Hearings on Building Materials Prices", "The President's Council on Wage and Price Stability held a public hearing in early October to ", "Review ", "rising prices of wood products and other building materials. The purpose of the hearing was to determine the reasons for and solutions to the accelerating housing costs which contribute to general inflation within the U.S. economy. Testimony was presented at the hearing by organizations representing building materials consumers such as the National Association of Home Builders, the National Lumber and Building Materials Dealers, and the U.S. Department of Labor's Chicago Construction Coordinating Committee. The materials producers were represented by the National Forest Products Association and two major wood product manufacturers, Georgia-Pacific Corporation and Weyerhaeuser ", "Company. ", "Others testifying in", "cluded Congressman James Weaver of Oregon and representatives from conservation groups: Sierra Club, National Wildlife Federation, and National Resources Defense Council. Cited as common denominators of price inflation were: (1) ", "cyclical ", "demand ", "which May create supply-demand imbalance resulting in shortages and price increases; (2) ", "general ", "inflation ", "which affects all products and services such as wages, fringe benefits, transportation, machinery and equipment, taxes, and other business operation costs; (3) ", "raw ", "material ", "shortages ", "caused by reduced timber harvests on Federal timberlands and bidding up of stumpage prices (price of the standing tree) which affect lumber; (4) ", "capital ", "investment ", "which is difficult to raise or accumulate due to unattractive profits or profit potential, or tax laws and regulations which May constrain needed replacement, expansion, or modernization of plant equipment; (5) ", "over-expansion ", "in anticipation of continuing strong demand, which May not materialize and which May result in low capacity utilization, and possible closing or dismantling of marginal plants; and (6) ", "government ", "environmental ", "policies, ", "laws, ", "or ", "programs, ", "which materially increase the cost of doing business. Forest industry leaders stated that the best opportunity to increase wood product supply to meet housing and other demands is by making more timber available from the National Forest lands, which hold more than 50 percent of the Nation's inventory of softwood sawtimber. The industry suggested that immediate and near-term needs for expanded production of wood products must be met from the area where timber resources are located and where productionn capacity is underused, which is in the West. It was also suggested that the Government provide appropriate incentives to stimulate investments which would expand production capacity and improve productivity through further technological developments to increase yields from raw materials.

Lontar's plant is located on a river which, at high tide, can accommodate barges of up to 1,500 tons. These barges, which at present bring imported raw materials for the plant, will, after the expansion, be used to ship finished products to Java. Shipments to Medan will continue to go by truck. Investment in the plant to date is calculated at U.S. $3 million. With the expansion of facilities contemplated, that investment will almost double. In addition to the domestic market, Garuda Mas sells significant quantities overseas. Sawtimber is exported to the United States, the Netherlands and Singapore, while railroad crossties are sold to Belgium. Limited quantities of plywood have been sent to the United Kingdom, where it passes rugged British quality standards. The major market for plywood, however, is Indonesia itself, particularly Java. Domestic plywood prices are often as much as 50 percent above prevailing world market levels. Demand is strong and shows no signs of slackening. To service its clients on Java, Garuda Mas maintains a sales office in Jakarta. It has also recently appointed a firm in Surabaya to handle distribution in Eastern Indonesia. Garuda Mas' Medan office will soon move to a new five-story structure in the heart of the city. The firm, which employs 1,900 persons, is entirely under the control of five brothers of Chinese extraction who reside in Medan. Source: American Embassy Indonesia report dated August 1978.", "4. Papua New Guinea: Timber Industry Expansion Underway", "Papua New Guinea has the potential of being one of", "the giants of the southeast Asian timber industries. It is second only to Indonesia in total forest area and a close third (after Malaysia) in readily harvestable acreage. Permits have been issued to harvest up to 1 million hectares", "of forest area, and an additional 1.2 million hectares of", "timber rights are available for leasing by developers. Another 8 million hectares is capable of being logged but timber rights would have to be negotiated with local owners. Papua New Guinea (PNG) has a total wood processing industry of 130 factories including 90 sawmills, one plywood mill, three veneer Mills and one woodchip mill. The industry employs 4,000 people, pays about $7 million per year in wages, and has a total investment of $42 million in land, buildings and plants. The industry currently earns about US $3 million in exports, or about 4 percent of total National export earn", "ings. Markets for these products are in Japan and Australia while Korea, Taiwan, and the Netherlands are beginning to buy some timber products. The industry also provides an estimated 60,000 cubic meters of sawn timber and 3,600 cubic meters of plywood for local consumption. The value of the locally consumed timber is US $24 million. The PNG Forestry Industry grew rapidly until about 1973-74 when world prices Fell. In 1974-75 two very large sawmills started operation; but despite this, total production Fell dramatically in 1974 and 1975. Production picked up in 1976 but Fell again in 1977.", "Industry Problems", "The stagnation of the timber industry May be attributed to lower international timber prices, the high cost of production in PNG, and strict government regulations. Papua New Guinea forests contain many different types of hardwoods\u2014in some cases as many as 100 different varieties in a single square mile. Core rot is prevalent. Minimum wage laws and low worker education levels have combined to make PNG a high Labor cost country. As a result of these conditions sawmilling a cubic yard of timber costs $85 as compared to $25 in the United States. Since PNG Government regulations have required a quick transition from export of logs to export of sawn timber, it is easy to comprehend why the timber industry has not prospered.", "Future Prospects", "The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Primary Industry, Julius Chan, has announced upcoming changes in Papua New Guinea's regulations. The changes will encourage greater log exports and will require less construction of social infrastructure on the part of new investors. Some tax breaks will be given to those companies already involved in sawmilling. Though roughly 6 dozen sawmills have closed down in the past 3 years, several are now in various stages of being re-opened under new management. In addition, serious negotiations are under way for major foreign investment in the timber industry. The most immediate is the plan of Hyundai, the Korean firm, to build a multi-million dollar woodchip mill in New Britain. Other projects under serious negotiation include a $2 million logging operation in Manus, a $2.5 million logging operation in the eastern highlands, and a $5-10 million forestry development project in Vanimo near the Irian Jaya border. The Department of Primary Industry is estimating that the new regulations will allow for a tripling of log exports over the next 3 years. This expansion will come partially through greater utilization of existing", "\ncapacity and partially out of additions of new capacity.", "Change in Industry Structure", "If the new regulations take effect as expected, there should be a great increase in the amount of logging. Many companies have found themselves in a position where they could sell logs but not sawn timber. The Government requirement to keep a fixed ratio between the two limited the company's log exports.", "In the meantime, many sawmills are turning inward to local markets. At present most furniture and wood products are still imported despite the great deal of surplus wood left over from sawmilling operations. Local firms are now beginning to build furniture, boxes, furniture parts, etc., and this industry is expected to grow in the next few years. The Government of Papua New Guinea has recently let a tender for a consulting contract to help develop a plan for such an industry in the Central province.", "Source: American Embassy Papua New Guinea report dated August 1978.", "5. Council on Wage and Price Stability Hearings on Building Materials Prices", "The President's Council on Wage and Price Stability held a public hearing in early October to Review rising prices of wood products and other building materials. The purpose of the hearing was to determine the reasons for and solutions to the accelerating housing costs which contribute to general inflation within the U.S. economy. Testimony was presented at the hearing by organizations representing building materials consumers such as the National Association of Home Builders, the National Lumber and Building Materials Dealers, and the U.S. Department of Labor's Chicago Construction Coordinating Committee. The materials producers were represented by the National Forest Products Association and two major wood product manufacturers, Georgia-Pacific Corporation and Weyerhaeuser Company. Others testifying in", "cluded Congressman James Weaver of Oregon and representatives from conservation groups: Sierra Club, National Wildlife Federation, and National Resources Defense Council. Cited as common denominators of price inflation were: (1) ", "cyclical ", "demand ", "which May create supply-demand imbalance resulting in shortages and price increases; (2) ", "general ", "inflation ", "which affects all products and services such as wages, fringe benefits, transportation, machinery and equipment, taxes, and other business operation costs; (3) ", "raw ", "material ", "shortages ", "caused by reduced timber harvests on Federal timberlands and bidding up of stumpage prices (price of the standing tree) which affect lumber; (4) ", "capital ", "investment ", "which is difficult to raise or accumulate due to unattractive profits or profit potential, or tax laws and regulations which May constrain needed replacement, expansion, or modernization of plant equipment; (5) ", "over-expansion ", "in anticipation of continuing strong demand, which May not materialize and which May result in low capacity utilization, and possible closing or dismantling of marginal plants; and (6) ", "government ", "environmental ", "policies, ", "laws, ", "or ", "programs, ", "which materially increase the cost of doing business. Forest industry leaders stated that the best opportunity to increase wood product supply to meet housing and other demands is by making more timber available from the National Forest lands, which hold more than 50 percent of the Nation's inventory of softwood sawtimber. The industry suggested that immediate and near-term needs for expanded production of wood products must be met from the area where timber resources are located and where productionn capacity is underused, which is in the West. It was also suggested that the Government provide appropriate incentives to stimulate investments which would expand production capacity and improve productivity through further technological developments to increase yields from raw materials.

", "VENEZUELA'S MAJOR FORESTRY PROJECTS", "(Excerpted from American Embassy-Caracas Report)", "Summary", "Venezuela has begun a number of large forestry projects to satisfy the fiber requirements of that nation's pulp and paper Mills. Raw material needs are particularly acute with respect to secondary fibers for the paper and board industry, long-fibered pulp for newsprint, and softwood timber for use in the construction industry. The pulp and paper industry is heavily dependent on imports, with 83 percent of all pulp requirements being imported. As these projects reach maturity, opportunities for U.S. businessmen will arise in construction, consulting/engineering, and equipment sales.", "Because of current pulp, short fiber, and timber shortages, Venezuela has embarked on an ambitious planting/development program for Caribbean pine and eucalyptus in the southern Anzoategui and northern Monagas State areas, respectively. The objective is to convert the Sabanas into a gigantic forestry and industry complex capable of supporting several pulp Mills that would not only supply domestic needs but also provide valuable export income. The two major government agencies responsible for these developments are Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) and Compania Nacional de Reforestacion (CNR).", "Uverito ", "Project ", "The Uverito Forestry ", "Project ", "was begun in 1969 by Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana with the intention of planting 218 million trees on 150,000 hectares by 1985, in order to produce long fiber pulp-mainly for the production of newsprint. Long fiber pulp is currently imported at an annual rate of 80,000 tons. Caribbean pine (Hondurensis), imported from Guatemala and other Central American countries, is the type of tree being planted. To date, about 80 million trees have been planted on 110,000 acres, with an additional 110 million planned for 1984. Plans are being made to harvest trees for pulp production in 1984. Eventually, 4,000 hectares out of every 10,000 will be harvested for pulp, with the remainder being conserved for timber production (maturity: about 10 to 15 years). By 1986, CVG expects to reach the 4,000 hectare level, with an expected yield of 180 cubic meters per hectare. CVG will require forestry equipment and technical assistance for the extraction process.", "In preparation for the harvesting period, CVG has plans to build a pulp mill capable of producing 200,000 tons annually, which should be completed by the 1984 deadline.

This was accomplished through aggressive market development and competitive pricing by the world market pulp producers. In the soft world market and aggressive selling atmosphere in the first half of the year, U.S. export market pulp lost some ground from volumes shipped during January\u2013June 1977\u20131.306 million short tons compared with 1.378 million short tons of exports (table S-14). Pulp exports, however, are only a small part (5 percent) of total U.S. pulp production. Market pulp Mills, operating at about 96 percent of capacity during January\u2013June according to the American Paper Institute (API), compared with a 94 percent operating rate during the 1977 period, funneled more of their pulps toward the domstic paper, paperboard and allied products Mills.", "Total woodpulp production of captive, or integrated and market pulp Mills is reported at 24 million tons for the first 6 months of 1978, compared with 23.9 million tons for the 1977 period (table S-3). These data, however, are incomplete because the date covering miscellaneous \u201cother\u201d grades of pulp, including defibrated, exploded, screenings and related wood fibers, are not available. The final pulp production figure will probably approach 25.5 million tons for January\u2013June 1977. On an annual basis, pulp production would approximate 51.3 million tons for 1978; up from an estimated 50 plus million tons for 1977, and from 48.8 million tons for 1976. Thus, the pulp industry has been producing to meet a slowly improving demand for its product. Producer inventory data are not yet available from the Bureau of the Census; but API data indicate no inventory building at the pulp Mills. Pulp inventories at the converting Mills also show essentially no change from 1977 levels (table S-4, table S-5).", "The leading pulp grades in demand in both domestic and export markets continue to be the bleached and unbleached sulfates (table S-3, table S-14). The total of all sulfate pulp grades, at 18.1 million tons for the first 6 months, was 500,000 tons or 2.8 percent over 1977 sixmonth figures. This tonnage also continues, as in 1977, to represent nearly 75 percent of the total reported 24.0 million tons of pulp production. Production of groundwood grades, including growing volumes of thermomechanical pulps, decreased from 2.3 million tons in the 1977 period to 2.1 million tons for January-June 1978. Semi-chemical pulp production also Fell slightly, from 2.1 million tons to 2.0 million tons for 1978. The production of corrugating medium, based on this pulp, Fell; while the use of wastepapers in a combination furnished medium increased (table S-5). This increased use of wastepaper in combination medium furnishes, especially old corrugated, is reflected in the wastepaper consumption data, by grade (table S-2). Old corrugated consumption at the user Mills, at 2.5 million tons, grew 460,000 tons or 17 percent over 1977 six-month consumption figures.", "The production of Special alpha and dissolving pulps dropped slightly from 1977 figures (table S-3). This is reflected in the 8 percent reduced consumption of those grades (table S-5) at the non-paper Mills, where producers of rayon fibers, cellophane and related chemical-converted pulp-based products are being steadily challenged in the market by other man-made fibers, filaments and films. The reduction of Special alpha and dissolving pulp production was also influenced by a drop in exports of these grades from 413,000 tons in January\u2013June 1977 to 403,000 for the 1978 period: a drop of 2.4 percent in exports (table S-14).", "The total picture, however, for the pulp producers during January\u2013June 1978 has been one of some improvement. The estimated final 1978 pulp production figure, at 51.3 million tons, will be an all-time record high; close to 2.5 percent above 1977 production.

Growing demand, stemming from the second quarter upturn in the U.S. economy as well as buying by offshore economies, provided added impetus to the 1978 growth of paper and board production. As reported by the Bureau of the Census, U.S. paper and board output in the second quarter totaled 16.3 million tons, a gain of 5.3 percent over the first quarter figure. For the half year, production equalled 30.8 million tons, 3.5 percent higher than the comparable year-ago level. As published by the American Paper Institute, the capacity utilization rates for paper Mills averaged 93.4 percent in the first 6 months of 1978 while those for paperboard Mills averaged 91.9 percent in the same period. Capacity utilization rates in the comparable period a year ago averaged 91.7 percent and 91.1 percent, respectively. Production of the paper grades, which amounted to 7.4 million tons in the second quarter, was up 2.3 percent over the first quarter figure and totaled 14.6 million tons for the first 6 months of the year, a 5.9 percent increase over the comparable 1977 period. Reflecting sharp gains in the nondurables sector and a pickup in export trade, the packaging-oriented paperboard segment showed a ", "7.7 ", "percent favorable quarter-to-quarter change and totaled 14.3 million tons in the January\u2013June period. Since the growth pattern emulated that shown in 1977, there was only a small improvement in the comparative 1977-78 half-year totals. Production of the building paper and board components, reflecting the continued high level of construction activity, climbed 8.9 percent higher in the second quarter and amounted to 2.8 million tons for the first half of 1978, a 4.9 percent increase over the first 6 months of 1977. In the paper sector, year-to-year improvements were evident in production of virtually all grades of paper but continued to be centered mainly in the printing and writing papers, which are currently reflecting the expanding demand from the burgeoning magazine industry and continuing growth in overall advertising. As a group, printing and writing paper represents the bulk of all paper output, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total paper output. Production of these papers was up 8.5 percent in the first half of 1978 compared with the similar period in 1977. The other two major paper grade sectors, tissues and coarse papers were up 3.1 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. Preliminary reports on second quarter production of some paper grades such as newsprint, coated two-sides printing papers, bristols, and the bag and sack papers, indicated lower second quarter output. Paperboard production finished the second quarter on the upbeat with a notable trend in the quickening tempo of linerboard production. Production of linerboard, the bedrock for the industry, increased 6.6 percent in the", "second quarter and totaled 6.8 million tons for the half year. Annualized, the second quarter rate would represent record production levels. Output of the combination paperboard grades, which use wastepaper as the major fiber source, moved up in the second quarter but finished the half year only 1.6 percent higher than the same period a year ago. Production of the bleached paperboard grades showed a comparative year-to-year decline of 14 percent as a strong second quarter performance, particularly in milk carton stock, was unable to offset a poor first quarter output and a similar strong second quarter showing a year ago. Second quarter production of the building paper and board grades was 8.7 percent higher than the first quarter total.

This was an 11 percent increase over the same period in 1977. Actual starts of residential construction for the first 6 months showed 986,400 starts, an increase of 4.0 percent. Single family dwellings comprised 72 percent of the total housing starts, compared to 75 percent a year earlier. The percent of single family starts is a key indicator for solid wood product demand since more lumber and plywood are used in single family construction than in multiple unit construction. In general, common walls and use of substitute materials such as brick and block in multi-family construction reduce the amount of structural wood products used.", "Lumber", "For the first 6 months of 1978, production, shipments, and orders received of softwood lumber were running slightly less than the same period in 1977. Production of softwood lumber was less than half of one percent below the first half of 1977, while shipments were 1 percent less and orders received were about 2 1/2 percent less. The reduced levels of production and orders of softwood lumber during such a high rate of demand possibly reflect the severe winter weather over the first part of the year, reducing logging operations and construction activity, and the anticipation by lumber wholesalers that housing demand\u2014thus lumber demand\u2014will taper off by the end of 1978.", "Specifically, softwood lumber production in the southern pine region for the first 6 months of 1978 was essentially the same as in 1977; the Douglas fir region showed a 4.8 percent increase in production; the western pine region a 4.0 percent decrease; the California redwood region, a 6.3 percent decrease, and other softwood regions at virtually the same pace. The southern pine region produced 26 percent of the total softwood lumber for January\u2013June 1978; 30 percent for the Douglas fir region, 31 percent for the western pine region, and 7.3 percent for the California redwood region. Therefore, the Pacific Northwest continues to produce the majority of the softwood lumber needs for the domestic and export market. However, indications are that the direction of", "flow of softwood lumber from the Southern and Pacific Northwest-producing region are changing. Freight rates on the Nation's rail lines from the Pacific Northwest to the northeastern consuming regions are, according to industry sources, becoming cost prohibitive. The southern producing region (basically the southeastern States) has an increasing advantage in the freight proportion of the lumber costs to the northeastern wholesaler. Also, various sources indicate that the Pacific Northwest producers are directing sales to western markets and export. U.S. exports of softwood lumber to all countries for the first six months of 1978 were 703 million board feet, a 12 percent decrease from the same period last year. Japan and Canada were the two leading purchasers of U.S. softwood lumber, buying 203 and 193 million board feet, respectively. These two countries purchased 56 percent of U.S. lumber exports. Australian purchases ranked third at 68 million board feet and Italy ranked fourth at 58 million board feet.

Industry sources indicate that Korea's purchases of U.S. softwood logs are ultimately consumed by (1) the domestic market, and (2) the export market, to either Europe or Japan. The lower wage rates of the Korean forest products industry allow these products to be exported competitively with the United States.", "Imports of U.S. softwood sawtimber logs were virtually negligible in comparison to consumption at 41 million board feet, for the first 6 months of 1978. Practically all U.S. imports of softwood logs come from Canada. Canada regulates the export of unprocessed softwood logs with the intent to export only softwood logs that are in excess supply of domestic demand. The United", "\nStates prohibits the export of softwood logs from Federal lands (basically National Forest lands), but does not prohibit export of logs from State and private lands.

Canada continues to dominate the import share with 99 percent of total U.S. purchases of softwood lumber. In the first 6 months of 1978 imports accounted for 27 percent of apparent U.S. domestic consumption. For the first half of 1977, imports of softwood lumber accounted for 25 percent of apparent domestic consumption.

Exports of softwood plywood of 176 million square feet were running slightly less than the volume exported by mid-year 1977. The major drop in total volume of softwood plywood exports from 1976 to 1977 of 60 percent was due in major part, to (1) the increase in domestic demand for softwood plywood in 1977-78, (2) the Canadian resolution of Labor disputes in their forest products industry, and (3) the devaluation of the Canadian dollar. Also, the strong market for U.S. plywood in Canada in 1976 quickly diminished in 1977. Imports of softwood plywood are virtually negligible as a part of domestic consumption at 18 million square feet for the first 6 months of this year, and represent less than one-half of one percent of the apparent domestic consumption of softwood plywood.", "Softwood Prices", "Softwood lumber Producers Price Index (PPI\u2014formerly Wholesale Price Index) increased 22 percent from", "June 1977 to June 1978, and increased 16 percent from December 1977 to June of this year. The relatively high price increases of lumber and plywood compared to the \u201call commodities\u201d index led to President Carter\u2019s remark in his April 11, 1978, anti-inflation message that directed the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Council on Environmental Quality to find ways to increase timber sales from Federal lands. Increased timber sales from National Forests would, hopefully, ease supply price pressures on lumber and wood products. Another issue that would potentially affect timber sales volume, is the Road less Area ", "Review ", "and Evaluation (RARE II). About 62 million acres of roadless and undeveloped National Forest land are being reviewed under RARE II for the completion of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The RARE II process of land-use planning should be completed by the end of 1978. The industry points to the 26.5 million acres of commerical forest land being reviewed under RARE II as a necessary timber source to meet the projected rising demand for timber products until the end of the century.", "Other softwood product PPI'S in June 1978 were millwork at 244.9, a 27 percent increase over June 1977; softwood plywood at 236.0, a 16 percent increase over June 1977; and softwood veneer at 249.1 (1971=100), a 36 percent increase over last year.", "The current housing boom was the key factor in price increases to above a 20 percent level in the 1-year period. However, the increasing cost of raw material (the softwood log) to the primary producers of softwood products over the past several years is also an important factor influencing price increases. For instance, U.S. Forest Service statistics show that Douglas fir peeler (used for veneer and eventually plywood) log prices increased on the average from 1971 to 1977 about 19 percent each year to around $300 per thousand board feet. In 1971, Douglas fir peeler logs were selling at $128 per thousand. Douglas fir sawtimber log prices showed an average annual increase of 23.4 percent from 1971 to 1977 or a total of 163.5 percent in the 7-year period. The average price of all grades of Douglas fir sawtimber logs in 1977 was about $227 per MBF.", "Prices quoted are for water and inland sales used in domestic consumption. Export sales have generally been at considerably higher prices than domestic sales. In 1977, the price differential between domestic and export log sales was about $85 per thousand board feet for Douglas fir peeler logs, due partly to the higher grade of peeler logs sold for export.", "Hardwoods", "Hardwood lumber production for the first 6 months of 1978 was 3,160 million board feet, about a 5 percent", "Get this book in print", "About this book", "Get this book in
