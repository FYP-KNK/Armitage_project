Unfortunately, the Herald is concerned the bill will not restore faith in the industry unless it creates a well-funded, independent and powerful regulator to set and enforce building standards, as already exists in Victoria and Queensland.", "It will surprise some to learn that NSW lacks such a regulator since the NSW government last year hired with much fanfare David Chandler, a well respected industry expert, to be its Building Commissioner.", "In fact, despite the fancy title, Mr Chandler is just another government employee with no statutory authority and minimal staff. The draft legislation released in November does not change that and does not even mention the role of a \u201cbuilding commissioner\u201d.", "Yet the regulator will need statutory independence to take on the big developers. The current system of private certification has a built-in conflict of interest because it is paid for by developers. To act as a useful backstop for private certification, the current approach of regulation by several different ministries is too fragmented and too weak.", "Once a strong regulator is established it could make full use of some of the extra powers which Mr Anderson has included in the draft bill. They include investigative powers to audit shonky builders and powers to license and regulate certain trades and professions in the building industry.", "Mr Anderson this week talked about creating a power for regulators to stop people moving into shonky apartments by refusing to issue an occupation certificate.", "That might be useful in some cases too but it would have made little difference to the residents of Opal Tower, where problems only came to light well after the apartments were occupied.", "The draft bill also proposes a system of compulsory insurance of builders and designers of apartment blocks, but a strong regulator is important because it will increase scrutiny of developments while they are under construction rather than after the fact when mistakes are costly to fix.", "Mr Anderson\u2019s new idea of a risk-rating website is interesting but it is sketchy and fraught with uncertainty. He seems to want private rating agencies to develop ratings by looking at each builder, designer and developer\u2019s track record, based on council filings and any complaints lodged against them.", "Yet if the builders pay for ratings of their own projects, the conflict of interest will be fatal. On the other hand, accurate up-to-date due diligence on every builder could cost far more than consumers are willing to pay. And ratings agencies may not want the perilous job of putting a black mark against the name of a Sydney property developer.", "For these reasons, the risk-rating scheme is worth exploring but it should not distract attention from the primary task of creating a strong, independent regulator who can keep the industry honest right from the start.", "Article By The Herald\u2019s View \u2013 Sydney Morning Herald \u2013 ", "Source Link", "Fire Boar services, maintains, installs and certifies Fire Doors.", "Fire Doors or a \u00a0Fire Rated Doorset consists of a door leaf, door frame, with\u00a0hardware such as closers, handles, locks, vision panels, air grilles, and is defined under Australian Standard AS1905.1.", "Fire rated doorsets must be self closing and self latching to be\u00a0certified and when installed correctly with approved hardware, a tag and certificate is issued for the frame and the door.", "The term \"fire door\" is the common short form used for a \"fire-resistant-doorset\".

the second anniversary of the Grenfell disaster.", "As night fell on Wednesday, buildings in London, Greater Manchester and Newcastle were illuminated with messages up to 12 storeys high warning that two years after the fire that killed 72 people, they are still not fitted with sprinklers, feature defective fire doors or are wrapped in dangerous cladding.", "NV Buildings in Salford were illuminated with a message that read: \u201c2 years after Grenfell and this building is still covered in dangerous cladding. #DemandChange.\u201d A leaseholder, Peter Brown, said nearly 250 households faced a bill of nearly \u00a33m to make their homes safe, and families and children feared for their safety because the building was wrapped in combustible expanded polystyrene insulation.", "\u201c[The government response] has been too little, too late,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have shrugged off responsibility for hundreds, if not thousands of buildings that do not meet regulations and are not fit for purpose. Ultimately this is the government\u2019s responsibility.\u201d", "In London at Frinstead House on the Silchester estate, which neighbours Grenfell, the projection highlighted its lack of sprinklers. All new residential towers require them, but retrofitting is not mandatory. In Newcastle, Cruddas Park House, a council block of 159 households where there have been bin fires, was lit up with the message: \u201cThe fire doors in this building are still not fit for purpose.\u201d", "\u201cThis is not something we should have to fight for,\u201d said Hannah Reid, 24, a dental nurse on the estate. \u201cWe are afraid the same thing [as Grenfell] could happen to us. The demands of the people of Grenfell were ignored and the same thing is happening to us. Not just us but all across the country.\u201d", "The projections were organised by Grenfell United, which represents the bereaved and survivors of the 14 June 2017 tragedy, and comes amid growing concerns about high-rise safety two years after the worst loss of life in London since the second world war.", "It has also emerged that MPs warned ministers in 2014 not to dismiss warnings about the safety of combustible cladding panels and the need for sprinklers in case \u201ca major fire tragedy, with loss of life [should] occur\u201d. The chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety and rescue, David Amess, told Stephen Williams, then the communities minister, that he was \u201cat a loss to understand, how you had concluded that credible and independent evidence which had life safety implications, was not considered to be urgent\u201d, according to letters obtained by Inside Housing magazine.", "The MPs raised further concerns in 2016 and 2017 about the government\u2019s failure to review fire safety regulations following the 2009 Lakanal House fire, which killed six people. They wrote several times to Theresa May\u2019s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, then the housing minister, who admitted the review was taking too long.", "Karim Mussilhy, who lost his uncle Hesham Rahman in the Grenfell fire, warned \u201cthere are many other Grenfell Towers out there\u201d and in a statement directed at whoever becomes the next prime minister, said: \u201cYou have an opportunity to make changes that will echo throughout generations \u2026 that people are safe in their homes and are treated with respect and something like this will never happen again.\u201d", "The widening threat came into focus on Sunday when fire ripped through the facade of a Bellway Homes housing block in Barking, east London, reducing timber balconies to cinders. There were no deaths, but one building expert, Sam Webb, said that if it had happened during the night like at Grenfell, people could have died.", "None of the public funds so far made available are targeted at removing combustible materials other than aluminium composites.", "This week, leaseholders at the Skyline Central 1 tower in Manchester were handed bills of up to \u00a325,000 a flat to strip off and replace high-pressure laminate cladding. The building also has inadequate fire breaks built into its walls.", "Bills are as high as \u00a380,000 a household to fix Burton Place, another residential high-rise in Manchester, which has timber cladding and combustible insulation, which are not covered by public funds.", "The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said building owners were primarily responsible for the safety of their buildings. It said it had stepped in to fully fund the replacement of unsafe ACM cladding on high-rise social and private residential properties where building owners have failed to do so and that interim steps had been taken to ensure that all buildings with ACM cladding were now safe.
