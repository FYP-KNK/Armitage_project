We assume the widely accepted IEC 60825-2:2011 Safety of Laser Products Part 2: Safety of Optical Fibre Communications Systems (OFCS).", "Using different safety standards does not yield very different VFL performance results, as we will find out. However, failing to comply with local occupational health and safety standards exposes organizations to malpractice and bad corporate image-quite apart from possible eye damage, which could be to a child if that child picks up an unsafe VFL that was accidentally left behind on a work site. With broader fiber deployment, it is no longer safe to assume that a VFL will always be used in a restricted work environment.", "Shown here is a total emission safety test on a VFL pen using a\u00a0power meter with a large-diameter optical detector. This VFL\u00a0has a short fiber stub; its total emission is -1.5 dBm, but it couples\u00a0approximately 3 dB less into a fiber.

With pen-style VFLs, this is a specific safety issue because of the very short fiber stub, or lack of a fiber stub at all, in these units. The uncoupled emission is often about 6 dB higher than the fiber-coupled emission quoted on the specification.", "Because of this issue with uncoupled VFL eye safety, a well-designed instrument-style VFL with a length of internal fiber after the laser, can go about 6 dB\u00a0(or 1 km) farther than a pen-style VFL that lacks a fiber stub, for the same eye-safety rating.\u00a0", "In the world of VFL use, it\u2019s the worksite operator, not the VFL manufacturer, who is responsible for laser\u00a0safety. Again, anything other than a Class 1 VFL requires particular site signage and staff training. At\u00a0Kingfisher International, our research shows a very modest performance improvement in exchange for all this effort. It is our position that a VFL that meets Class 1 specifications without a coupled fiber is the clear default\u00a0option.", "The performance, or range, of a VFL is determined by the VFL coupled output power (as described in the previous discussion about eye safety), the fiber attenuation, eye sensitivity, and other factors. We\u2019ll look at each\u00a0of these.", "This is always going to be an uncertain factor. The chart in this article, from fiber-optics.info,\u00a0shows a spread of values. Based on the graph, the very likely values in the 650-nm window (which is just off the\u00a0graph to the left) would be 5 to 7 dB/km.

So we will use 6 dB/km as our baseline. Previous tests produced quite similar results. Note this is many times the loss at, for example, 1310 nm, so this light cannot go very far.", "One other important point: High-power VFLs are available only at 650 nm, not 635 nm. Any discussion of so-called\u00a0\u201clong-range VFL\u201d must usefully be about 650 nm. The highest-powered 635-nm VFLs now available are\u00a0only about -2 dBm. Therefore, what follows discusses 650 nm only.", "This seemed quite consistent among a number of people. The most significant variations relate\u00a0to ambient light, plastic pigments in cables, what people are trying to do, and exactly how they do it.", "In strong ambient sunlight, light often cannot be seen\u00a0leaking through the side of the fiber bend at all, so using a VFL for fault-finding in daylight may not\u00a0produce any useful result. We conducted our tests in a typical office environment with fluorescent lighting.\u00a0We either used just this fluorescent lighting, or cupped our hands over the fiber to provide reasonable\u00a0shade.", "This procedure raises some interesting points. For example, trying to conduct fault finding on outside plant cabling would benefit from having a hut over the expected problem area to provide shade. If trying to find a fault indoors, it is helpful to turn down the lighting.\u00a0The eye is better able to pick up a blinking light, so all our tests used a flashing VFL.", "The worst \u201cfluoro lit bend sensitivity\u201d was on 3-mm yellow patch lead, at -16 dBm. The best sensitivity was on\u00a0900-\u03bc (uncolored) fiber, at -20 dBm with cupped hands. Shifting between 3-mm yellow patch lead and 900-\u03bc\u00a0fiber only caused a 4-dB (<1 km range) variation in our bend-sensitivity tests. However, some other patch-lead\u00a0pigments can actually absorb all the red light. Shifting from \u201cfluoro\u201d to \u201ccupped hands\u201d ambient light caused\u00a0about 4 to 7 dB of variation. Certainly there is some \u201coperator error\u201d here, and that\u2019s only to be expected\u00a0because an exact bend radius is rarely repeated. We bent pretty hard!", "This is a practical way to check continuity. We used two methods: 1) naked eye, and 2) a microscope with no\u00a0visible wavelength filter. Actually, this raises an important issue: A microscope with no visible filter is highly\u00a0dangerous for any VFL above Class 2 (5 mW). So we would not recommend users to use such a scope, but we\u00a0did this for the sake of completeness. For safety, we\u2019d recommend that scopes be fitted with a red safety filter so\u00a0that users\u2019 eyes are protected from any VFL.", "The difference between using the naked eye and using a microscope was approximately 7 dB, which translates\u00a0to roughly 1 km of range. With the naked eye, the sensitivity was 57 dBm. Although we did not test it, it is easy\u00a0to deduce that a \u201cblob\u201d of light from a break will be theoretically visible at about this level, minus 4 to 7 dB of\u00a0plastic absorption. However, this is an extremely weak level, which would be too hard to see in practice if users\u00a0are searching around a wiring closet, etc. So we put a vague number of about -40 dBm on this one, because it\u00a0may be hard to \u201cshade\u201d the cable run.", "A number of other variables should be considered, such as:", "These are all essentially unknowns, and all they are ever going to do is degrade performance. In practice this\u00a0means that trying to use a VFL toward the limit of its theoretical range discussed here may be an unrewarding\u00a0experience. Given that fault finding is usually not an easy task, this is perhaps not altogether unexpected. It\u00a0does, however, mean that you\u2019d want some alternative fault finding tools available if needed, such as a clip-on\u00a0fiber identifier or an OTDR.", "Once you understand the implications of 6-dB/km attenuation, a lot of often-confusing side issues can be safely\u00a0ignored. The resulting best-case performance is summarized here. Actual performance may be a lot worse in\u00a0many cases, but it\u2019s highly unlikely to be much better.", "Some VFL manufacturers claim 20 Km, 30 Km, and 50-km range. However, the farthest a 50-mW VFL can go is approximately 13 km when looking at a connector tip. Our final conclusion (and it is quite obvious to us) is that there is really not very much practical performance difference between a safe and unsafe VFL.

So a properly characterised LED is the preferred source, and measured attenuation values will be worst case.", "Whilst easy to comprehend and implement, it is understood that CPR does not adequately define the beam geometry in all cases, so further work is currently under way to devise another method. Modal Power Distribution (MPD) and Encircled Flux are two ideas currently being investigated for this purpose.", "A mandrel wrap is typically five turns of multimode patch lead around a mandrel. It is used to strip off very high order \"edge\" modes, which are unstable and cause measurement instability. Use of both a defined CPR and a mandrel wrap achieves best repeatability. The fiber type should match the application.", "Note that in this arrangement, a mandrel wrap does not significantly affect the CPR, it just strips off edge modes. Failure to use such a mandrel wrap affects measured results by making them a bit more variable.", "Class 1 CPR and a mandrel wrap attempt to replicate, in the field, the launch condition used in the factory (defined by FOTP-50B) for qualifying attenuation and connector insertion losses, thereby providing field measurements that more directly relate to manufacturer's specifications. This allows users to better assess the quality of their networks.", "The standards define a mandrel wrap as being 5 non-overlapping turns of cladding mode stripping fiber. The diameter depends on the core diameter and standard being followed. For 62.5 u there is good agreement that the core should be on a 20 mm diameter (the mandrel may be a different diameter depending on the sheath thickness, up to 3.5 mm). For 50u cores there is currently total disagreement, the Europeans stating 15 mm, and the USA opting for 25 mm.", "Kingfisher International are specialist designers and manufacturers of handheld fiber optic test equipment.", "Our equipment is used in all phases of fiber optic manufacture, installation and maintenance.

Obvious failure to meet legal health and safety requirements could spark a wider investigation into the organization. International eye safety standards regard the user organization as responsible for eye safety, not the equipment manufacturer.", "The actual problem is like this: if an unsafe VFL is directly aimed into an eye once in a lifetime, immediate permanent eyes damage is probable. Given the potential severity of the situation, just using warning labels and issuing work instructions is not adequate. It is highly desirable that it should be \"impossible\" for this to happen.", "It is impossible to prevent occasional accidental exposure, since someone viewing a fiber end may not know that a VFL is active at the other end. It is also quite possible that while one person is viewing a fiber end, someone else turns on a VFL which is (possibly unexpectedly) connected through to the fiber under examination.
