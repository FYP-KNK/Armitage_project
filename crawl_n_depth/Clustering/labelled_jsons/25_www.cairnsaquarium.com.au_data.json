Along the edge of this blade are a series of 16 to 20 evenly-spaced, long, thin teeth, creating\n    the appearance of a \u2018saw\u2019. It is this saw that has contributed to the decline in numbers of these mazing animals as they are hunted for their unique\n    and peculiar rostrum, fins and meat.
