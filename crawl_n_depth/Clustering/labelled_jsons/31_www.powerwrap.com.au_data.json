If the current dispute between the two biggest contributors to global gross domestic product becomes a full\u2011scale trade war, it will adversely impact not just the U.S. and China, but the entire world economy. Trade wars do not produce any winners in the long term.Tariffs directly affect economies in two main ways: first, because they function as simple taxes on goods and, second, because they cause uncertainty, which impacts household and corporate decision\u2011making. Let\u2019s look at each of these in turn. Although taxes on goods increase the tax revenues of governments, they also lead to a miss-allocation of resources, which drives the overall economy into an inefficient equilibrium. In economics jargon, this is known as the \u201cdeadweight loss\u201d of taxation. Because tariffs raise the price of consumption, the purchasing power of households is reduced and fewer goods are bought. At the same time, households and companies try to substitute away from the tariffed goods, thereby ending up consuming a basket of goods that has been distorted by the tax. This new basket of goods represents an inferior choice to the consumer.", "When President Donald Trump tweets that the U.S. will win the tariff war, he assumes that U.S. households and companies will substitute toward a domestically produced basket of goods and that this will indirectly create new American jobs. I\u2019m skeptical. In my view, it is more likely that U.S. households and companies will shift their consumption to goods produced in Vietnam or Mexico rather than back to", "American\u2011produced goods and that U.S. jobs which have been outsourced to China will not be repatriated before the production process has become entirely automated. American\u2011produced goods would be a viable alternative if either the U.S. was the most cost\u2011efficient producer after China (which it is not) or if the U.S. harbored the production facilities required to produce electronic gizmos it currently imports from China. In an unsettled trade regime, U.S. companies are unlikely to build onshore production facilities to cater to this potential demand.", "\u201cAlthough taxes on goods increase tax revenues, they also lead to a misallocation of resources\u201d", "The second way that tariffs reduce consumption is by creating uncertainty, which causes households to postpone consumption and companies to defer capital expenditures. The impact of uncertainty on an economy is akin to monetary tightening (which is clearly not part of President Trump\u2019s agenda). As the U.S. and China are the two biggest economies in the world, any uncertainty created by a prolonged trade war between the two will affect the global economy. The few countries that might benefit are those, such as Vietnam and Mexico, that can deliver substitutes for tariffed Chinese goods in a cost\u2011efficient manner.", "Trade wars do not just hit consumption, they also impact inflation, central bank policies, and exchange rates. As tariffs function largely like consumption tax hikes they are likely to cause headline inflation to rise initially, but just like any other form of fiscal tightening, they will eventually cause growth to slow. This will lead to an increase in output gaps, which reduce core inflationary pressures. As U.S. households and consumers substitute away from goods produced in China, China is likely to respond by trying to export its excess capacity to the rest of the non\u2011U.S. world. This is how the disinflationary shock of tariffs is transmitted across the globe. The impact of tariffs on central bank policies will differ by region. For a developed economy central bank, the monetary policy implications of tariffs are straightforward: Tariffs lead to slower growth and lower core inflation pressures, so the appropriate monetary policy response is dovish. In emerging markets, however, rising uncertainty is more likely to trigger capital outflows, putting downward pressure on growth and upward pressure on inflation. To keep capital onshore, emerging market central banks may be forced to respond with monetary tightening.", "\u201cThe impact of uncertainty on an economy is akin to monetary tightening\u201d", "How tariffs affect exchange rates is a complex function of demand elasticities. Usually, the country whose output gap is most adversely affected by tariffs is likely to see its currency depreciate the most. In the current environment, this would mean that emerging market currencies would depreciate versus the U.S. dollar and the U.S. dollar would lose ground against other major currencies.Given the negative overall impacts of tariffs, it is tempting to conclude that sanity will prevail and that the U.S. and China will step back from the brink and walk away from a situation that will only serve to harm the economies of both countries.", "However, President Trump seeks to be reelected next year and may decide that the political gains from an outright fight with China outweigh the political cost of slower economic growth. Indeed, support for populist parties across the world continues to grow on the back of rising inequality and concerns about the impact of globalization. Tariffs may not be a good idea economically, but it is politics, not economics, that wins elections. Consequently, we are unlikely to see the back of tariffs anytime soon", "I agree to the terms and conditions stated below", "The Prospectus does not constitute an offer in any place where, or to any person to whom, it would not be lawful to make such an offer.

But one of the things we like to see when we\u2019re looking for exceptional fund managers is a great long term track record, coupled with not so great short term performance. A recent study by a respected investment firm has found that there\u2019s a lot of sense in that approach.", "The study was conducted by Research Affiliates, a US firm specialising in asset allocation, smart beta, and active equity investment strategies. The research looked at Morningstar data for US managed funds for the 27 years from 1990 to 2016. They analysed the data for each three year period.

While this seems counterintuitive, it\u2019s very similar to what we experience here in Australia. And it makes sense to us. Here\u2019s why.", "\u00a0", "You\u2019ll see from the data in the chart above that the average fund (the 5th and 6th deciles) underperforms by 0.1% to 0.2% per annum.

But they tend to still perform in a similar way to the wider market.", "At each end, we have the most active funds \u2013 those that deviate most from the market benchmarks. The reason the most active funds have the widest range of results comes down to how they invest. For any fund to be able to outperform significantly over the long term, they must hold a portfolio of investments that is very different from the index. They usually achieve this by holding a more concentrated portfolio, by specialising in a certain area (e.g. smaller companies) or by adopting a strategy that allows for differentiation (e.g. being able to hold significant cash from time to time).", "These differentiating features mean the fund can outperform over the long term. But it also means they can, and do, underperform as well. So, investing differently can lead to very good outcomes, but with the chance of also achieving poor outcomes.", "\u00a0", "Even the greatest of managers have times when they lag the market. Sometimes, performance coincides with market conditions. For example, for much of the past two years, growth focused funds have materially outperformed value based funds. That doesn\u2019t mean every growth manager has outperformed, but it is more likely to be the case. Sometimes performance is cyclical for other reasons. For example, fund managers with concentrated portfolios tend to go through \u201crealisation\u201d periods, when a number of their ideas come to fruition and performance is exceptional. They similarly can go through \u201crenewal\u201d periods, where they are buying into new ideas that can take 2-3 years for value to be realised.

I had always wanted to be stockbroker. The hustle and bustle of brokers yelling out orders and trading stocks gave me a buzz like none other. I couldn\u2019t think of doing anything else. Nothing else interested me. I loved trading shares and watching charts. I traded shares while I was at uni, at home and even while I worked as a mobile phone salesman. I was a great salesman. I wasn\u2019t a shark but I could easily sell ice to an Eskimo. Combine that with trading skills and a stockbroking career was the perfect fit. Of-course it wasn\u2019t easy, no one would hire me. I copped rejection after rejection. I never gave up though and in the end I got lucky. The boss at a well-known stockbroking firm took a liking to me and gave me my first lucky break. He hired me on the spot. Fresh out of uni and with little experience, I punched the air walking down Collins St, tears of happiness streaming down my face, I felt on top of the world.

I\u2019ll never forget it.", "On my first day, the big boss handed me a licence to make money. \u2018Authorised representative\u2019 it was called. I was also given a computer, a phone and a share registry. That\u2019s a list of shareholders and their contact details from an ASX company. Away I went. My job was to ring the three thousand odd shareholders on that list and convince them that I could make them money. If I did, they\u2019d open an account and trust me with their life. A daunting task but after a while I got the hang of it. I hardened up and rejection didn\u2019t both me. With the help of a flamboyant broker who sat next to me, I perfected my pitch and started to sell stocks as if they were mobile phones. It was a bull market, everything went up. This was after the GFC when the mining boom was in full flight. It was all about mining and geology. Because my broking firm covered mining stocks, mining CEOs from a small cap mining companies would visit every day. Desperate for capital they\u2019d give a flashy presentation on high grade gold, uranium or what-ever element on the periodic table they thought they had found. Of-course most of those tiny companies no longer exist. They\u2019re long gone or have been transformed into tech companies. If they came out with a good drill hole, a 20c share price was over $3.00 tomorrow. Millionaires were made overnight. Sometimes all it took was a positive research report and the stock would double. It was easy to make money during the mining boom, you could throw darts at any small cap mining stock and ride it to the moon. Times were so good, extravagant lunches were a daily event. Life was great.", "Little by little I started to build a portfolio of clients that I would speak to almost every day. They trusted me and I trusted them. Everyone was winning. But I hadn\u2019t struck it rich yet like some of the older brokers. I was told to really make it you need a \u2018ten bagger\u2019 i.e. a stock goes up to 10 times its purchase price. One stock to rule them all. One winning horse to put your entire client base in. I decided on a stock called MEO Australia. It was a junior gas explorer that was on the verge of hitting a massive LNG discovery. It was the most talked about stock on my desk. MEO this, MEO that. Everyone\u2019s buying MEO. \u201cIt\u2019s already up, get on it before it\u2019s too late.\u201d And so I did. I sold the story like a scene out of the movie Boiler Room.

If the well came good as everyone was so sure it would, I\u2019d be driving a flashy new sports car and walking on sunshine. Shares had run up from 30 cents to well over $1 and some broking firms had given it a valuation many multiples higher.

They\u2019re done.\u201d I sat there in utter disbelief, unable to comprehend what had just happened. How could this be? And then it started. Shares came out of its trading halt and went into free fall. They fell from $1.59 to 0.26c. That\u2019s an 84% fall at the blink of an eye. A $100k was now worth $16k. I almost vomited. I went into a panic and started shaking. I didn\u2019t know what to do. It was like a car accident. Everything was ripped from under me. It went from fun and games to a horrible nightmare. How was I going to tell my clients, my dad, my girlfriend, that I\u2019d just lost almost all their savings?", " I picked up the phone and called the client that had lost the most. He answered the phone with an excited voice, expecting me to deliver good news. It was anything but that. He went silent, then started yelling. I could feel the pain in his voice, it was gut wrenching. There were countless nights where I\u2019d lay awake replaying his voice over and over. I said sorry to him so many times but the damage was done. I\u2019d blown him up and the best I could do was apologise. I walked outside and balled my eyes out right in the middle of Collins St. But the worst was yet to come. My next phone call was to my then girlfriend, that didn\u2019t go down too well. That day still haunts me.", "They say sometimes you need to lose everything to appreciate, understand, and gain it all back again. Sometimes you need to lose it all to find yourself. There is a lot of truth to all that. One thing\u2019s for certain I learnt one hell of a painful lesson. I vowed never to be so ignorant again. I vowed never to listen and follow others so blindly and never to make decisions without doing my own research. I vowed never to let this to happen to me or to a client again. I vowed never to be so blas\u00e9 with life and money. I was a fool to think I could get rich quick. Life doesn\u2019t work like that. And so I created a system of checks, stop losses and controls to prevent me from making rash or irrational decisions that could put my financial freedom in jeopardy again. My life changed forever that day.

The implicit assumption within the question is that a high PE stock cannot be a value stock. To many, it would appear that buying companies with high PE ratios runs contrary to a value-based investment philosophy. Yet nothing could be further from the truth. In this newsletter we explain our approach to value, our relative confidence in ensuring that we are buying at a reasonable discount to fair value when we invest and why the Auscap Fund portfolio typically ends up with a lower average PE than the broader market as an outcome of, rather than an input into, the investment process.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "Value investing is defined as buying financial assets for less than they are worth. It could be stocks, corporate debt or residential property to name a few. We all understand the value principle on a small scale, it is no different to picking up a bargain at the local market or in the Boxing Day sales. It involves determining the value of an asset and purchasing that asset at a price that is lower than its value. Sharemarket investors approach this by trying to work out the present value of all of the future cash flows of a business, and what that represents in terms of value on a per share basis. This is not an easy exercise, requires a considerable number of inputs and is dependent on some key assumptions that can turn out very differently to how an investor expected. If the key assumptions in a financial model are wrong, the resulting change in valuation can be enormous. For example, there have been a number of instances of toll roads being significantly overvalued due to optimistic forecast traffic assumptions.", "As the future is unknowable, all assumptions are prone to significant inaccuracy, irrespective of the intelligence or knowledge of the forecaster, although a higher level of knowledge and experience will typically lead to less inaccuracy. Because of this, the value investor insists on purchasing shares only when they trade at a reasonable discount to what they believe is the true worth of the investment. That way, if the reality turns out to be less positive than the assumptions the investor has used to value the asset, there is a margin of safety that can be utilised before the value investor loses money on the investment. While it does not prevent a value investor from losing money, it reduces the probability of doing so.", "The value of a company is the present value of the future cash flows. If those future cash flows are growing very quickly, then the value of the company as a multiple of its current year earnings will be high. So as a value investor we might find a business that we have a high degree of certainty will grow at a rapid rate for a considerable period of time very attractive despite it trading on an above-market-average multiple of earnings. The PE premium, relative to the market, is justified by the company\u2019s superior growth prospects and can still represent a discount to the \u201cfair value\u201d multiple for the business given its characteristics.", "Similarly, a company with modest earnings growth might also be attractive to us, but only at a discount to an appropriately lower fair value multiple of current year earnings. When assessing business value, the current PE ratio is only one small part of the equation. The growth of the business, the quality of the company\u2019s assets, the degree of certainty we have in relation to the earnings trajectory and the risk of significant variance in financial outcomes are a few of the other critical variables that require an assessment. Quantifying and evaluating the relative significance of each factor is why investing is often considered a combination of art and science.", "If value investors are looking to only buy into companies when they are trading at a discount to their intrinsic value, it makes sense that on average they will have a portfolio with a lower overall PE ratio than the broader market, even if their portfolio is representative of the broader market in terms of the average growth rate and earnings quality.", "Value investors also tend to value certainty of future cash flows and the likely growth in cash flows derived from a business over time. Valuation is typically dependent on forecasting many years into the future. To be sure that you are getting a discount, you need to have conviction in your assumptions. It is easier in many ways to assume that a good business will continue to grow at a reasonable rate into the future than to have confidence in the assumption of continued high growth for many years. All experienced investment managers have seen the impact of tail-risk events on valuation. High growth industries can be disrupted, the high growth can attract new entrants who take market share, or growth can slow for any number of reasons that are not anticipated today. As the adage goes, trees don\u2019t grow to the sky.", "So often it is easier to conclude that assumptions of reasonable growth into perpetuity might be more reliable than those of continued rapid growth for many years into the future. As a result, many value managers tend to have a slight bias away from very high growth businesses, because they value the safety of assumptions that are, or at least appear, more conservative and less subject to material unforeseen interruption or deviation. But it does not exclude value managers from buying high growth businesses if they are confident that they are buying at a price that represents a significant discount to the company\u2019s conservatively estimated underlying value.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "We attempt to represent this diagrammatically below. The graph assumes all other factors, such as business quality, return on invested capital, balance sheet strength, and many other quantitative and qualitative attributes, are held constant. Lower PE portfolios as an outcome, rather than an input. Given these natural biases, value managers tend to have lower PE portfolios than the broader market. The Auscap Fund portfolio typically has a lower PE than the broader market. But to suggest that we target such a portfolio is incorrect. In fact we constantly look for attractively priced opportunities to buy into high growth, high return on capital businesses that have a large number of future reinvestment opportunities.

This is not nearly enough to give it confidence that monetary policy will stimulate the economy toward its new full employment target, which is a jobless rate of less than 4.5 per cent (compared to today\u2019s 5.2 per cent level).", "That immediately introduces the need for a third cut, which may be why financial markets are pricing one in by the end of the year. The problem, of course, is that the RBA will get even less pass-through at that time, perhaps as little as 5 to 10 basis points.", "Finally, there is the nontrivial complication that the US Federal Reserve is likely to slash its own cash rate, which will put upward pressure on the Aussie dollar and directly detract from the RBA\u2019s attempts to stimulate the economy.", "\u00a0", "This presumably explains why RBA governor Phil Lowe is suddenly talking about the \u201climits of monetary policy\u201d and expressing a desire to see fiscal policy furnish more support. The problem with this logic is that Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg were elected on the basis they would balance the books and deliver a string of surpluses. The only thing likely to stop them doing this is the threat of a full-blown recession.", "When you think through this decision-making tree, all roads inevitably lead to the RBA sensibly expanding its monetary policy toolkit to target a wider range of interest rates than just the conventional overnight cash rate. This should include longer-term risk-free rates and the spreads over these benchmarks that determine bank funding costs and hence the practical savings and loan rates they set for depositors and borrowers. If the RBA wants to, it could quite easily link its wider interest rate targeting program to changes in both bank funding costs and the rates they charge customers. Whether we really need rate cuts is naturally a very different question. What we know is that the RBA has made an extremely vocal case that driving the economy towards full employment will deliver the community large welfare gains.", "One could easily counter that these jobs will be in businesses experiencing artificially high rates of growth powered by unsustainably cheap money. Indeed, many of these firms might not exist in a normalised interest rate world, wherever that long-term cost of capital lies. In the meantime, we all need to focus on making money. A core objective of the RBA\u2019s rate cuts is to force folks out of cash deposits into higher-risk investments, which appears to be working on the evidence available thus far.", "And while investors may be worried about superficially low interest rates, if yields and credit spreads keep compressing, total returns can be very large indeed. Over the last 12 months, a portfolio of sevenyear AAA rated government bonds yielding, on average, only 2.1 per cent delivered a stunning total return of 11.4 per cent. This is because the expected return from these bonds collapsed from 2.4 per cent a year ago to 1.2 per cent today. The price of the bond has therefore jumped to reflect the fact investors are now happy to accept much lower yields. The point is that one can capture enormous returns from ostensibly low-yielding investments if the required yield drops sharply. The trick is to find those investments that still appear cheap in a world where most asset classes look heinously expensive.", "One team that has proven especially adept at hunting out such bargains is the high-profile long-short duo Rob Luciano and Doug Tynan, of VGI Partners.

Yield is well bid; \u201cdefensives\u201d, or at least those with earnings certainty through the near term, are trading in sympatico with bonds, at multiples hitherto unseen. The other side of the barbell is growth, or the promise of growth, which has now rerated to a level unseen for decades, since the heady days of the tech bubble in 1999 and early 2000.", "The reach for yield is exemplified by the performance of the REIT sector, led by Dexus (+26%) and Goodman Group (+36%) through the past year. Ten years ago, as JP Morgan has noted, listed REITs in Australia raised $12.5b in fresh equity, and the following year another $3b was raised. Since then, no more than $1.5b net has been raised in any year, and some years have seen more buyback activity than issuance. Five months in and year to date more than $2b has been raised, with an enthusiastic audience for the equity offer mostly raised to acquire office property, and the yield offered on acquisitions is telling. Dexus, for example, acquired the remaining 50% of the MLC Centre in Sydney it did not own for $800m in March, at a cap rate of less than 5%, and hence a cash yield, being after maintenance capex, of closer to 3.5%. Dexus is not alone in seeking exposure to office property in Australia, especially Sydney, currently. Other office and industrial assets are being traded at similar multiples. Investors are bidding aggressively for equity being raised to finance these transactions.", "And yet, at the other end of the ASX listed property spectrum, sits Unibail Rodamco, which has fallen through the past year by a similar magnitude to the rise enjoyed by Dexus and Goodman Group. It\u2019s easy to say that in a yield compressed world, defensive assets are well sought and repriced accordingly. It is true; except when earnings start to go the wrong way, however modestly. As Unibail exemplifies; a 5% fall in earnings for the year to December 2019, even with a modest increase in forecast thereafter, has seen a 30% fall in equity value. Plenty of retail property assets in the Australian market are for sale, and even at much lower multiples than that being commanded by their sexy cousins in office and industrial property, buyers are hard to find.", "Very few sectors don\u2019t experience price and earnings cycles. Property certainly does. As our analyst Daniel Peters has highlighted, CBD office rentals throughout Australia over the past 30 years have shown no real growth and have seen wide cyclical swings, just like commodities. In every major capital city through this time, cyclical falls of almost 70% have been experienced from peak prices for rents. The only capital city showing real growth as a market is Sydney; and even then this has only emerged in the past two years as a confluence of exceptional factors has seen supply withdrawn (to allow for the construction of Metro stations and the repurposing of a couple of major towers) in conjunction with strong demand growth, led ironically by the major banks (which keep talking to staff reductions). Within two years, a significant amount of redevelopment will have been completed and supply of space hence become available; it may be that at that time, the cyclical forces that have historically characterised this market again dominate pricing. Two years away, though, is an eternity in a market where the most important factor right now is to try and avoid next month\u2019s downgrade, especially when the contractual nature of lease terms for property means that the economic impact of violent price moves is deferred in any event until the lease expiry, and hence the grace period from price declines will be even longer for property equity owners. This consolation is a piffling one, alas, when a multiple in excess of 30 times earnings is being paid upfront.", "Growth is the other side of the market barbell. \u00a0The so called WAAX stocks, the technology darlings of the ASX, have had a magnificent six months of performance. Make that three years, such that their market caps are at absolutely high levels by any measure. All of Altium ($4.5b market cap), Appen ($3.1b), Afterpay ($5.7b), Wisetech ($7.1b), have been between three and nine baggers in the past two years, and together today represent a market cap equivalent to Brambles ($20b; which makes $1b EBIT), and IAG ($18.1b; which makes $1.3b pre-tax profit) but significantly larger than South32 ($16b; which makes $1.5b in EBIT) and Santos ($14b; which makes $1.3b in EBIT). In contrast, for the $20b in combined market stocks for the WAAX stocks, EBIT is forecast to be less than $200m this year, and cashflow will be far less.", "Notwithstanding the stretched starting multiple, there is a good argument that the WAAX stocks are classic growth stocks, that will make higher future returns and for an extended period. It is possible, albeit this cannot escape the requirement to value that future growth by placing a multiple upon those expectations today. A good parable for the investment error that can arise in such situations is the experience of Computershare shareholders that acquired shares in the company during November, 1999, at $9.10 per share (in current terms). The share price was lower than this in July, 2016; almost 17 years later, even though the business had grown its earnings (1999 net profit after tax was $38m) almost 10 fold through that period. Many of the WAAX stocks today, co-incidentally, make a profit which is close to what Computershare did in 1999; if they too, grow their profits ten fold by 2036, would you expect their share prices to remain at current levels? We are not looking to cherry pick by using Computershare as an illustrative example; any other market darling technology stock listed on the ASX in 1999 or 2000 will have produced results for shareholders which are vastly inferior to the Computershare experience. Sometimes, even gold medals aren\u2019t worth the price paid for them.", "Finally, Computershare is an example of a company which grew its profits aggressively between late 1999 and now. Funnily enough, even as its share price corrected, profit growth was still strong (doubling into F2000, for example). The current market dynamic is a little different. Any downgrade is met with an immediate and solid market cap whack; of at least the downgrade, and no matter the relative recent appeal of the company and/or sector. Shareholders in all of Costa Group (-32%), Reliance Worldwide (-26%), Nufarm (-23%), Bluescope (-23%), Link Administration (-23%), Mayne Pharma Group (-23%), Bellamys Australia (-22%) and Technology One (-20%) all saw the value of their equity drop more than 20% during May, and in each case bar Nufarm, earnings were downgraded (Nufarm\u2019s had been downgraded not long before that). Several of these stocks had in recent years been equity market darlings; the fall from hero to zero can be brutal.", "\u00a0", "Outlook", "Toto, we are not in Kansas anymore. Low to no interest rates are causing large dislocations in the price of Australian equities perceived to offer security of income, on the one hand, and growth on the other, with a squeeze in the ugly centre where a downgrade pimple in a flash is priced as a de-rated mole, no matter the sector. Sustainability of earnings and, more importantly, cashflows, has never been more important, nor securities more harshly dealt with if expected levels of cashflow evaporates. The better opportunities that exist in the current market tend to be idiosyncratic, where cashflows are hit albeit not by structural factors, and where derated multiples become attractive.

Investors face two major risks that impact how much they have to fund retirement, and how long this will last: longevity risk, and the risk of inflation/rising costs over time. In simple terms, longevity risk is the risk of outliving your money. Inflation risk is the risk that rising costs (such as healthcare) reduces the purchasing power of your money each year.

This has been true for the last 20 years. An active approach does more than simply chase the highest yield, as would a passive approach to yield. An active dividend income strategy can increase income from companies whose dividends are healthy, but maybe not the highest, because they are also investing earnings into a growing business, hence into better earnings growth in the year ahead. Another quirk of dividend investing is that the highest yielding stocks are more volatile, as illustrated in Figure 2.", "Top decile dividend yielding companies tend to show higher volatility in returns, on average. An active approach to dividend income investing can seek to reduce portfolio return volatility by not chasing yield for yield\u2019s sake, but investing judiciously on the fundamental value of future sustainable earnings growth. Finally, top dividend paying securities may not be good value-for-risk, as illustrated in Figure 3.", "Chasing the highest dividend yield companies can provide poor value for risk taken when compared to the market. Lower decile stocks by dividend yield demonstrate a better performance for risk than for the top decile of dividend yield companies. High dividend payout ratios may also be indicative of a lack of equity reinvestment opportunities for a company, back into growing their own business. A company with a sustainable dividend profile usually seeks to reinvest some earnings into their business, into positive return projects that can generate earnings growth in the future. A classic example of a high dividend paying company compared to a company which has reinvested some earnings into productive opportunities for reinvestment is the difference between Telstra and CSL.", "Purely to illustrate two different journeys, take a look at the following example. Telstra was long considered a key dividend paying stock, but the burden of being the largest telco, legacy systems and infrastructure cost, rapid change and limits to growth have seen Telstra lose its status as a key dividend stock. By contrast, CSL has steadily transformed itself from also being government owned, as the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, into a global leader in biotechnology, largely by balancing the payment of dividends with significant reinvestment into areas that can generate future growth in earnings, as illustrated in figure 4. Of course, these relationships may change over time, but it can take a long time for a company to change its course.", "Astute active dividend income approaches can seek dividend yield while avoiding companies with no opportunity to reinvest to improve earnings and returns. With active dividend income approaches, investors like SMSFs, retirees, and investors approaching retirement can diversify away from traditional sources of income, like fixed income and term deposits, for a longer-term approach, diversified across high-quality Australian companies.

As such, the Ardea Real Outcome Fund (ARO) or its related ASX-quoted active ETF launched in December 2018, the ActiveX Ardea Real Outcome Bond Fund (Managed Fund) (ASX:XARO), may be smart alternatives for those investors to consider as term deposit (TD) rates decline in line with falling cash rates. But first, it\u2019s important to be clear that ARO and XARO are not cash or TD substitutes. This is because neither ARO nor XARO benefit from the government guarantee for bank deposits. Instead ARO and XARO are actively traded fixed income strategies which are intended to deliver a return higher than cash and TDs but may experience negative monthly returns and are subject to a range of other risks. For these reasons, ARO and XARO are not suitable to replace \u2018at call\u2019 cash products or where the investor is uncomfortable with the change in risk profile. That said, with current advertised one- and two-year TD rates from the big four Australian banks dipping below 2.00% p.a.1, ARO or XARO may be suitable investment alternatives for investors looking to invest surplus cash over a longer investment horizon and can tolerate a higher risk level than TDs.

While ARO\u2019s investment approach is unique, its portfolio is made up of the same high-quality government bonds and cash investments that conventional defensive fixed income strategies typically use. What\u2019s different is the way Ardea extract returns from these securities and the wide range of risk management strategies used.

Unemployment is exceptionally low. Whilst concerns have been raised about the weakening outlook for manufacturing, the uncertain outlook for trade negotiations and the persistent risk that the Chinese economy will stumble, the pricing infers that the market is fully discounting an exceptionally poor economic outcome.", " It should be noted that the term premium is estimated using econometric methods and these are subject to a range of estimation and specification errors. However, cross-checking these with another principal term premium estimator utilised by the Fed2, albeit with publication history from 1990, also results in a similar conclusion.

The OECD has recently3 estimated the cumulative impact on GDP from each of these events through to 2021-22. Whilst significant, the combined impact of these outcomes is unlikely to create a deep recession in the US. The US is a reasonably closed, services oriented, economy in that it is relatively resilient to international economic developments. This is one reason behind President Trump\u2019s repeated utilisation of trade as a means of coercion in international negotiations. The following illustrates the OECD\u2019s estimated impact for a deterioration in the trade conflict:", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "The OECD also estimated the impact of a significant 2% fall in domestic demand in China:", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "Over a two year period, a significant deterioration in the trade dispute would subtract approximately 0.9% to US growth. A significant disruption to demand in China, in isolation, would cumulatively subtract approximately 1.4% from US growth over a 2 year period. Note that the China demand slow-down scenario assumes that monetary policy is unable to act. The estimated economic impacts do not make allowance for any special fiscal support which might be forthcoming. For example, the US is supporting soy bean farmers for losses incurred as a result of the tariff dispute via subsidies. Hence, to the extent that the US would stimulate the economy fiscally during an adverse development, the scenarios would need to be even worse to justify the existing pricing. The US GDP baseline expectation is for growth in 2020-2021 to be 1.9%per annum. Even if the combined effect of a full US-China Trade War and demand shock in China were to take place, there is a significant buffer between this scenario and the outcomes which unfolded or, in the case of Brexit and the Kennedy Slide, were feared, during the only other times when the term premium was this low.", "\u00a0", "Distortions from international flows and Fed balance sheet activities", " Non-conventional use of central bank balance sheets to manage the yield curve as part of stimulus efforts operate by influencing the term premium. Although the Fed has unwound some of its balance sheet, its remaining holdings would still be exerting downward pressure on the term premium, however this is most strongly influential on longer term maturities. The prospect of the ECB restarting bond purchases in the Eurozone may also be driving capital from European debt in to the US and contributing to the more recent compression in the term premium. More generally, significant monetary accommodation and associated asset inflation may have had the effect of compressing term premium since sentiment strongly deteriorated from late 2018. The above may go some way to understanding the lower premium observed following the introduction of large scale asset purchases. Nonetheless, the estimated impact of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet activities4 would not be sufficient to negate the general observation that the term premium is pricing an extreme economic development. Even allowing for these effects, the market is acting materially more defensively than when the Euro faced an existential threat and the Brexit referendum was passed, both of which took place when the US economy was not as strong as it is presently.", "\u00a0", "Conclusion", " There are many looming threats to the recent recovery in the US economy.

The Fed acted as expected by cutting rates by 25 basis points both in July and in September, but has not committed verbally to a more extended easing cycle. The US yield curve inverted in the month, a phenomenon which often precedes recession. Despite the ebb and flow of optimism over a trade war resolution, any concrete plans to remedy the ongoing US-China dispute remain elusive. Increasing speculation over possible impeachment proceedings for President Trump further added to uncertainty.", "US economic data was largely stable, albeit it continued to moderate. Unemployment remains at 3.7% and wage growth in August was stronger (month-on-month) than anticipated. However, new non-farm job additions were lower than expected in August, at 130,000 versus predictions of 158,000.

Annual inflation was 1.0% in August, compared to 2.1% in the same month in 2018. Speculation over the possibility of further stimulus from the central bank dominated the summer. In September, the European Central Bank (ECB) took steps to boost the flagging economy, including restarting quantitative easing and committing to buying assets until its inflation target is reached. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, was nominated to replace Mario Draghi as president of the ECB when his term ends on 31 October.", "Italian politics was back in focus as the governing coalition of the right-wing League and populist Five Star broke up.

Meanwhile, survey data suggests that corporate managements are increasingly viewing their own share prices as attractive, which is one factor behind the near-doubling, year-on-year, in the value of share buybacks announced from April to September.

Turning to valuations, European convertibles became slightly more expensive.", "In commodities, the S&P GSCI Spot Index posted a negative return in Q3, negatively impacted by US dollar strength. Energy was the weakest component, amid a sell off in crude oil prices as demand concerns outweighed ongoing supply risks. This was despite a sharp price spike in mid-September following an attack on oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. Soft commodities were also weaker, led by corn.

Similarly, if you think about this in the inverse, the persistent outperformance of the Growth style (based on MSCI World Growth Index) is also peculiar, as it is historically known to underperform Value over the long-term.

This relationship between MSCI World value spread and that for Australia has only strengthened over time, especially since the GFC.

While the overall market declined, this was driven more by macro uncertainty over the US-China trade dispute \u2013 which saw the MSCI World TR index fall -2.33% in August \u2013 rather than an overly negative reporting season.", " \u2022 Around 42% of companies which reported downgraded their earnings guidance for the next twelve months, versus an historical average of just over 30%. Conversely, only 10% upgraded compared to the historical average of just under 20%. The greatest pressure came in areas such as steel \u2013 which saw earnings estimates for the next twelve months fall 15% \u2013 and also in media (down -13%) and telcos (-10%). Very few sectors of the market saw aggregate upgrades \u2013 and where they occurred, they were small. Consumer Discretionary (+1%) and health care (also +1%).", " \u2022 In aggregate, earnings expectations for the ASX200 for the next twelve months fell 3%, which reflects an environment in which housing construction has slowed and where weaker house prices have weighed on consumer demand.", " \u2022 That said, price action tended to reflect the both the view that broad outcomes were not as bad as some had feared. There is also a broad expectation that stimulus \u2013 in the form of cuts to interest rates and taxes as well as the possibility of more fiscal spending \u2013 could help underpin demand and prevent further falls. Signs of an improvement in the housing market are helping in this regard.", " \u2022 Hence media and steel \u2013 the two sectors with the largest downgrades \u2013 both outperformed the market and posted positive gains in August. Building materials did likewise, despite downward revisions. Discretionary stocks also did very well as companies like JB Hi-Fi noted in their outlook that demand and sales had started to tick up again in recent weeks.", " \u2022 All in all growth remains muted, however further signs of an uptick in the domestic economy could drive stock specific opportunities given how cheap many domestic industrial cyclicals are. We retain our exposure via positions in Qantas and Nine Entertainment among others.", " \u2022 We are mindful that both growth and defensive yield stocks have had a strong twelve month run on the back of falling bond yields. Yields are likely to remain depressed for a period \u2013 now is not the time to go aggressively underweight.

The investment thesis is grounded in the view that the company\u2019s ability to deliver earnings growth on the back of increased loans and material cost savings was not reflected in valuations. We also see the risk from Brexit as relatively asymmetric, in that a lot of the negativity had already been priced in. That said, we have been mindful of this exogenous risk, which is why the position has always remained relatively modest. Recent updates from management have revealed that the combination of the additional loan book acquired from Virgin Money, coupled with strong mortgage competition, continues to weigh on group lending margins. This has pushed out the timeline of our thesis and, while CYB continues to offer a decent yield, we are redeploying this capital into other opportunities, including a new position in Metcash.", "Buy new position in Metcash (MTS)", " Metcash is a wholesale distribution and marketing company. The introduction of new management with a strong focus on cost control and revenue growth in the last three years, combined with the sale of non-core assets, has allowed the company to manage a good turnaround despite the structural challenge that increased competition has posed for the Australian supermarket industry.", " MTS\u2019s recent underperformance reflects consensus downgrades for FY20 following their FY19 result. Some of this is driven by a moderating outlook for its hardware business, however we believe it also implies an overly negative outlook for its IGA wholesale business and the supermarket sector in general. There are signs the grocery price deflation \u2013 a key headwind for supermarket earnings in recent years \u2013 is easing on reduced promotional discounting across the sector. At the same time we believe that MTS\u2019s Diamond Store Accelerator programme will help it generate a better than expected share of sales. There are also signs that its cost reduction strategy could also exceed consensus estimations.", " From a sustainability perspective, Metcash has been utilising its IGA Community Chest Trust Fund for over 30 years to support the local communities reached by its widespread store network. The company has a focus on diversity and gender equality with key initiatives including reporting on gender targets, strong representation on the board (66%) as well as being cited as a WGEA Employer of Choice for Gender Equality. Other sustainability initiatives includes reporting on Modern Slavery as well as reducing waste and responsible sourcing of products particularly for its private label brands.", " MTS trades on 12.9x price-to-next-12-month consensus earnings versus 19.6x for COL. While we believe that MTS should trade at a discount to COL, we see MTS as below its intrinsic value and implying a very depressed valuation for the supermarkets business.

While downside risks have risen this year, we believe global growth should prove to be resilient. We remain encouraged by the ongoing strength of the consumer globally and the enormous amount of monetary stimulus supplied by both developed (DM) and emerging market (EM) central banks\u2014the combined weight of these two forces should truncate downside growth risks as we move closer to 2020.

Earlier in the year, an apparent sputter in consumer spending and income growth had caused us to reduce our forecast, but both indicators have rebounded over recent months making a low 2%-handle outcome most likely. This rebound in consumer spending and a tentative recent improvement in US manufacturing sector data make the chances of recession even lower now than they were a few months ago when we were expecting slightly slower 2019 growth. While various elements of the US economy are showing slower growth than was the case over 2017-2018, nowhere is there actual weakness or any indication of an ongoing deceleration that would raise the threat of recession.", "Constant news of tariffs\u2014and retaliatory tariffs\u2014between the US and China have caused some to fear the downside implications of this ongoing spat for the US economy. At present, however, we see no tangible evidence that trade wars are adversely affecting US economic aggregates. If anything, the US trade balance has improved slightly relative to trend so far this year, implying a slight boost to GDP growth, rather than the drag some profess to see. Developments in capital spending by US corporations also show some recent improvement, if anything, contrary to claims that trade fears are restraining capital expenditures. While core inflation measures have also rebounded a bit in recent months, the upswing merely offsets some of the especially low inflation seen earlier in 2019. All in all, then, inflation looks to be holding below the Fed\u2019s 2% target. We see nothing in Fed policy nor in the ongoing growth rates of nominal GDP that would suggest any meaningful upside pressure on inflation.", "We revise down our growth expectations for the eurozone in 2019 on the margin given recent data prints, but still believe that growth will come in around 1.0%. The slowdown in global trade has taken an outsized toll on German growth, while political risk earlier in the year is likely to have brought Italy to an economic standstill. We also view issues in the German car manufacturing and chemical industries as having contributed to the slowdown after four years of above-potential growth, but we see those hindrances becoming less important over time.", "Looking ahead to 2020, we also revise our growth expectations lower somewhat on the back of recent disappointments in soft data including service PMIs, but, on aggregate, we still see a small pickup over 2019 to around 1.2% on the back of Germany and Italy doing better. We expect the German economy to accelerate next year and grow around potential, partly due to base effects and partly as the result of the supply-side constraints mentioned earlier becoming less binding. Abating political noise in Italy should be conducive to growth rebounding there as well. Other large eurozone countries, on the other hand, could slow somewhat but are likely to grow roughly at potential, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies across the continent. Risks around this baseline for 2019, but especially for 2020, are skewed to the downside, in particular if the service sector weakness in soft data becomes more pronounced and starts showing up increasingly in hard data. Other key risks next year include a disorderly Brexit, higher crude prices, further trade escalation and renewed political risk in Italy.", "Regarding the UK, we are of the view that the recent Supreme Court ruling has substantially reduced the chances of a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit this year as it has strengthened the role of Parliament in the process. Instead, we expect that either (1) Parliament approves a deal before October 19 that is perceived as a marginal improvement to the one negotiated by former Prime Minister Theresa May or (2) the current Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2014or a caretaker government\u2014requests an extension before the end of October, followed by a general election. While the narrative keeps shifting, we are marginally more hopeful that a \u201cdeal\u201d will come to pass before the end of October as there seems to be a more concerted effort from the UK to make meaningful proposals on how to resolve the outstanding issues around the Irish backstop.", "Our 2020 growth outlook for the UK comprises, therefore, an unusually large degree of uncertainty. Inflation, similarly, depends significantly on the levels of the exchange rate and the introduction of tariffs and transaction costs, but we think that in the case of a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit, the Bank of England will look through a temporary rise in inflation and cut rates to support the economy.", "China\u2019s economy is slowing for both structural and cyclical reasons at a time when the global economy is softening. Facing this backdrop, Chinese policymakers have judged that giving their domestic producers breathing room with a currency devaluation makes sense. However, the key challenge for small and micro enterprises remains financing availability, as banks continue to be cautious in lending.

Take some money \u2018off the table\u2019 when a market pullback or correction lies ahead, and invest more when abnormally good times are in store. This is known as \u2018market timing\u2019. The potential of market timing to amplify one\u2019s investment returns from equities is significant. Since 1950 through to 2018 the US equity market, as measured by the S&P500, generated a compound annual return of 11.1% p.a. including dividends. The difference between the S&P500\u2019s annual market high and low averaged almost 20% (we use monthly data throughout for simplicity). An investor who had been able to trim or sell-out of equities altogether at the top each year and buy back in at the bottom would have turned the market\u2019s 11.1% p.a. return into something quite spectacular. As well as being an added source of profits, market timing is often used to soften the blow of declines. Behavioural psychology tells us that the pleasure and pain that share markets induce is not felt by investors equally \u2013 it takes roughly a 2% increase to offset the unpleasantness of a 1% fall. No wonder investors want to \u2018zig but not zag\u2019; who wouldn\u2019t want all of the market ups and none of the downs along the way? In this feature we first look at three market-timing signals popularly used by investors seeking to sidestep an oncoming market sell-off, and what history tells us about how well these signals actually work. We then look at the other side of the market-timing trade, namely buying back in, and the challenges that entails. Lastly, we discuss how we at Aoris approach market timing, and how we reflect this in our portfolio.", "\u00a0", "When equity investors think about adroitly dodging a market fall, they usually look to one or more of the following three early warning signs:", "1. a recession", "2. a high equity market valuation and", "3. the duration of the current bull market.", "Let\u2019s look at each of these in turn.", "\u00a0", "DOES A RECESSION FORETELL A MARKET CORRECTION AND IF SO, HOW RELIABLY?", "The association between economic recessions and equity market declines is strongly ingrained in investor psychology, and with good reason. Since 1950 there have been 10 recessions in the US and around each recession the US equity market declined by at least 10%, with an average fall of 23%. So, we could call the relationship between recessions and equity market corrections a strong one.", "But in which direction does this relationship work? Does a recession happen first, leading to an equity market decline? If so, we can simply let the GDP numbers tell us when to sell. Unhelpfully, in every one of these 10 cases the onset of recession happened after the equity market decline. So, a recession doesn\u2019t flag a forthcoming correction; the equity market anticipates one.", "SEEING AROUND CORNERS", "The challenge, then, is to anticipate a recession. There is a great deal of information available to investors to help in this regard. In the US, The Conference Board, an independent non-profit group founded in 1916, publishes an official Leading Economic Indicators series; here in Australia we have the Westpac\u2013 Melbourne Institute Leading Index of Economic Activity; and all the major central banks publish economic projections. On top of this, there are all sorts of data taking the pulse of the economy in virtually real time, such as online job postings, real estate searches, auction clearance rates, new business formation, transactions on Amazon, and freight transport volumes.", "Despite the wealth of data available and amount of human capital devoted to the task (the US Federal Reserve alone employs over 400 PhD economists!), the record of professional economists in forecasting recessions is poor. Let\u2019s look first at a single forecasting body, the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF publishes forecasts twice each year. Andrew Brigden, chief economist of London-based Fathom Consulting, found that of 469 recessions over the 30-year period 1988\u20132018 across 194 countries, the IMF correctly predicted less than one in four of them as at April of the year in which the economies actually contracted. If the economy went into recession on average in the middle of the calendar year, then a correct forecast in April gives us a lead of just two months. Equity markets peaked on average five months before the onset of the last 10 US recessions, with a range of one to 10 months. So, a two-month early warning signal doesn\u2019t really cut it. If we use their forecasts from October of the year preceding the recession, giving us a lead now of around nine months, the IMF correctly forecast less than one in every 30 recessions.", "There may well be individual economists with a track record that sets them apart from their peers, but how are we to identify them? In a world where we can rate Uber drivers, restaurants and", " Amazon sellers, why do we fail to publicly rate economists on the accuracy of their forecasts? What about \u2018the big one\u2019, the GFC? If you could pick just one recession in the last few decades to correctly anticipate, this was the one, as over the period mid-2007 to early 2009 the equity market roughly halved in value. Perhaps a mild recession is hard to pick in advance but a severe one should be like the lights of an oncoming train in a tunnel. Not so. In October of 2008, a month after Lehman Brothers failed, the IMF forecast that the global economy would grow by 3% in 2009 and just seven economies would be in recession. In reality, the world contracted and 91 countries went into recession. The 2008\u201309 recession in fact began nine months before Lehman collapsed, yet it wasn\u2019t even formally identified as one until it had been going for almost a year. Prakash Loungani at the IMF said \u2018recessions are not rare. What is rare is a recession that is forecast in advance\u2019.", "COMPOUNDING THE PROBLEM", "It is human nature to simplify things, and investors tend to think in terms of \u2018single variable\u2019 cause-and-effect relationships when it comes to economic activity. They draw simplistic conclusions", " such as \u2018I think the trade tension between the US and China will escalate, causing a recession\u2019, or \u2018interest rates will rise and therefore economic activity will decline\u2019. The economy does not work via such linear, univariate, causal relationships. If there\u2019s a trade war, how interest rates respond will impact economic activity. How consumers respond to a change in interest rates will affect retail spending and housing activity, which in turn will impact business spending, which in turn influences the value of the exchange rate and perhaps which party wins the next election. None of these responses are known in advance. This introduces the notion of compound probabilities. Let\u2019s imagine that an investor is an exceptionally good economist and can correctly forecast a key variable, such as major moves in the oil price, with a two-in-three success rate. Now, let\u2019s imagine that this investor/economist can also correctly forecast the economic impact of a major move in the oil price, also with a two-in-three success rate. If this individual forms the view that oil prices will rise sharply, which in turn will cause an economic slowdown, one could easily fall into the trap of thinking that they have a two-thirds chance of being right. However, we need to recognise that there are two outcomes being forecast and to calculate the probability of getting both right we need to multiply the probability of each individual prediction being correct. Now, 2/3 times 2/3 = 44.4%.", "Economies, of course, work nothing like this grossly simplified version of reality. They get very complex, very quickly. The interconnectedness of an economy is far more like a billiard table", " when a single ball strikes many others. Professor Michael Berry, a mathematical physicist from Bristol University, examined this, and was described by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2007 book The Black Swan as follows:", "If you know a set of basic parameters concerning the ball at rest, then it is rather easy to predict what would happen at the first hit. The second impact becomes more complicated, but possible; and more precision is called for. The problem is that to correctly compute the ninth impact, you need to take into account the gravitational pull of someone standing next to the table. And to compute the fifty-sixth impact, every single elementary particle in the universe needs to be present in your assumptions! An electron at the edge of the universe, separated from us by 10 billion light-years, must figure in the calculations, since it exerts a meaningful effect on the outcome.", "In their quest for simplicity and mental shortcuts, investors all too often omit the complexity underlying the behaviour of economies and conveniently ignore the reality of compound probabilities.", "HOW MUCH DOES BEING THE WORLD\u2019S BEST ECONOMIST ACTUALLY HELP?", "We\u2019ve established that correctly anticipating recessions repeatedly is very, very hard. However, forecasting recessions, even with 100% accuracy, only goes so far in market timing. Of the 17 occasions in the last 70 years when the US equity market experienced a decline of 10% or more, seven were not associated with recessions, including the October 1987 crash.", "In summary, at Aoris we believe that attempting to time the market and reduce exposure to equities based on an anticipated recession is unlikely to improve our investment returns. It\u2019s simply not something we believe we can do well on a repeatable basis, for several reasons. Firstly, only 10 of the 17 (less than 60%) of the equity market corrections in the US since 1950 have been associated with recessions. Secondly, rather than simple, one-to-one causal factors between a variable and a recession, economies comprise exceedingly complex interrelationships. The compound probabilities associated with \u2018if that happens then this will happen, and then this and then this\u2019 are routinely underappreciated. As a result, recessions are rarely correctly forecast and we are confident that we can\u2019t do better than the pros. Thirdly, selling out of equities in anticipation of a recession that doesn\u2019t happen entails an opportunity cost that can easily erode the gains made from avoiding the ones that do eventuate.", "\u00a0", "The second common signal used by investors to make a timing call on the market is valuation. It\u2019s natural enough to want less of something when it\u2019s expensive and more when it\u2019s cheap. The", " most commonly used valuation signal applied to the US equity market is known as the Shiller PE, created by Yale economist Professor Robert Shiller. This measure makes a sensible adjustment to smooth out the cyclical nature of corporate earnings and the data very helpfully goes all the way back to 1871.", "In the following chart we show, for each month since 1950, the Shiller PE relative to its full history from 1871 up until that particular month. So, for example, in 1985 the US equity market,", " measured by the Shiller PE, traded on about 0.7x its average for the period 1871\u20131985, while in 2005 it was valued at about 1.6x its average of the period 1871\u20132005. Note that the Shiller PE relative to its long-term history has been greater than 1x for most years since 1950. The red dots indicate the 17 market peaks prior to declines of 10% or more.", "US Shiller PE relative valuation versus history since 1871", "What this shows is that market valuations versus a long-term average have proved to be of no help in market timing. The three corrections between 1976 and 1981 occurred when the market", " was trading at abnormally low valuations relative to a long-term history. The GFC market crash happened after valuations had become significantly cheaper than the prior 10-year period. In", " 1992 an investor may have observed that since 1950 the Shiller PE had been above 1.3x its long-term history just 15% of the time. Using this knowledge, they may have decided to use a relative Shiller PE of 1.3x as a sell signal. Had they done so, they would have been out of the equity market for 23 of the next 26 years.", "So, market valuations relative to a long-term average are not of any use in short-term market timing. Nor are they helpful as a long-term indicator of future returns.", "\u00a0", "A third pointer that investors often use when seeking to time an exit from the market is time itself, i.e., how long the market has been appreciating. Is the market cycle \u2018long in the tooth\u2019, or is there \u2018plenty of runway left\u2019?", "Months from market trough to next peak", "You can see from the graph that time itself provides no reliable exit signal. The number of months between US equity market troughs and the next market peak has ranged from 12 to 93. After 1990, 30 months might have seemed like the point at which the equity hourglass had run out and was a good time to sell. Had an investor followed this rule, they would have sold more than five years before the market peak in 1998 and three-and-a half years prior to the October 2007 peak. The investor would have sold in September 2011 after the market had already fallen 12%, and would have exited four-and-a-half years prior to the September 2018 sell-off, over which time the US equity index doubled.", "The number of months that the equity market has been appreciating since it last troughed is not a useful market timing sell indicator.", "\u00a0", "Of the three market timing sell indicators, neither the duration of a bull market nor aggregate equity market valuations are of any help. Recessions have been associated with only 10 of the 17 declines since 1950 and have proven fiendishly difficult to predict with the requisite degree of repeatability.

For the market sell-offs that have happened independently of a recession, the news media will emphasise negative economic or geopolitical news to satisfy the psychological craving of their readers for an explanation. The negative headlines, which may or may not have any rational linkage with declining equity markets, make it behaviourally difficult for investors to buy into the preponderance of gloom.", "Regret aversion tells us that humans fear making a decision that may in hindsight look poor. So, rather than buying into a weak market and risking further declines, most people wait for signs", " that the market has stabilised or is improving before commiting to purchase. Compare the number of people turning up at property auctions in Australia now versus earlier in 2019. Well, that has a cost. The US market has historically appreciated by about 13% on average in the three months after bottoming. Then, buying back gets psychologically harder. Now the market is 13% more expensive, so the investor will be tempted to wait for a pullback that perhaps doesn\u2019t come.

Warren and Sanders are advocating some radical policy changes, including an overhaul to the health care system, breaking up big banks and tech firms, banning fracking, and imposing wealth taxes and higher corporate taxes. Biden\u2019s proposed policies are comparatively moderate, but still include reversing the 2017 tax cuts. Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris, two other candidates, are currently less favoured, but worth watching. And it is not yet clear exactly how the late entry of Michael Bloomberg may influence the race for the Democratic nomination. Support can swing wildly during the process \u2013 for example, Barack Obama overturned a significant lead in the polls for Hilary Clinton to win the Democratic nomination and ultimately the 2008 election.", "We should have a much clearer picture of who the Democratic nominee is likely to be by the end of March, when two-thirds of the primary results (by the number of delegates) are known. The primaries are followed by the respective party conventions, when the candidates are officially selected. Then it\u2019s to the presidential debates in September and October, before the US electorate finally casts its votes on 3 November (see Exhibit 3 for a timeline of key events).", "Who is likely to win? History strongly favours the incumbent: three quarters of sitting presidents have been re-elected, looking at elections going back to 1932. An incumbent president has never failed to win re-election unless a recession has occurred during their time in office, which perhaps explains the president\u2019s more conciliatory recent tone on trade. But President Trump\u2019s approval ratings are lower than those of other re-elected presidents were at this point in the election cycle.", "\u00a0", "It is worth bearing in mind that the impact that any president can have on the economy and market depends on their ability to enact legislation.

It is difficult to see President Trump regaining control of the House of Representatives, were he to win. Similarly, it is difficult to see the Senate shift to a Democrat majority. And so a divided Congress appears the most likely outcome. While political gridlock is not an ideal scenario, it may comfort investors to know that it could act as a considerable restraint on some of the more radical proposals on both sides. Regardless of the election outcome, it seems unlikely that the trade conflict with China will be fully resolved \u2013 surveys suggest that there remains widespread support among the US electorate to address unfair trade practices (Exhibit 4).", "\u00a0", "It is hard to say anything concrete about the likely impact of the election on markets. Historically, S&P 500 volatility has typically been higher in election years than in non-election years, as markets frequently reprice the probability of the future administration\u2019s policies. Markets have also tended to react more positively in the immediate aftermath of the election of a Republican president, as the party\u2019s policies are broadly thought of as more market friendly.

We struggle to see it. Our overall assessment is that corporate earnings will hold up in 2020 in most major regions, but we shouldn\u2019t expect too much growth. A key global problem is that tight labour markets are pushing up wage costs, but companies still have little top-line growth as pricing power remains elusive in most industries. As a result, margins are under pressure (Exhibit 5).", "The risks to this outlook for earnings appear broadly balanced. A re-escalation in trade tensions or margin pressures may lead firms to cut jobs, and the global economy could take a turn for the worse.

Real policy rates remain deeply negative.", "\u00a0", "Indeed, central banks are determined to do whatever it takes to keep the expansion going.

The Bank of England (BoE) has been caught in the Brexit headlights for some time, but has indicated some inclination to lower interest rates should the outlook deteriorate. However, an almighty fiscal expansion may end up doing much of the heavy lifting to support the UK economy in 2020.", "The message to investors from the central banks is clear: should further stimulus be required, it will be delivered. The Fed is under particular political pressure to demonstrate that it is a \u2018national champion\u2019.", "The central banks do not believe they are out of ammunition. They have new innovations up their sleeves. Quantitative easing has now been accepted as a \u2018normal\u2019 tool. Ambitions to return assets to the public markets seem to have been abandoned and central banks have accepted permanently larger balance sheets. Indeed, some are happy to take an increasing share of risk markets. With such large holdings of government and corporate bonds, the Bank of Japan is increasingly focusing its balance sheet expansion on the purchase of corporate equity (Exhibit 8).", "\u00a0", "There is also a growing consensus that zero is not the lower bound on interest rates. In theory, this is simply an extension of normal interest rate policy; interest rates are cut to entice savers to spend, but negative interest rates have the added sting in the tail that savers will be penalised if they persist in their prudence. Christine Lagarde, the new president of the ECB, may have little choice but to pursue negative rates further if European activity and inflation fail to pick up. We suspect, however, that her greatest contribution will come from her diplomatic skills, which will be necessary to advance the discussion among policymakers and politicians on the need for both fiscal expansion and further integration.", "Whether negative interest rates serve to boost private sector spending remains to be seen. But this may not be the primary channel of transmission. Low interest rates are an enormous cash windfall for governments, and could encourage governments to turn on the fiscal taps. This certainly seems to be playing out in the UK, where austerity has been well and truly declared over.", "\u00a0", "In summary, geopolitical risks are likely to continue to weigh on global corporate earnings, which, from these valuations, is likely to limit the extent of further upside in risk markets. At the same time, central banks are likely to remain active to limit the downside.", "Given this backdrop, investors may wish to consider:", "1. An equity allocation that is neutral but inclined towards more defensive stocks", "In our view, an equity portfolio more focused on large cap, quality stocks is likely to prove more resilient should the downside risks materialise. Perhaps more controversial is our view that value stocks will also prove more resilient. This is less about value stocks suddenly getting uprated, which would require a reacceleration of growth and the prospect of higher interest rates to lift the financials. Instead, it is our assessment that tech-heavy growth stocks may prove more cyclical than currently expected and thus more vulnerable to a downgrade in earnings expectations. However, if economic growth remains positive but sluggish, then the scarcity of growth may continue to favour the tech-heavy growth markets. Given this two-way risk, and the fact that the US market is techheavy, we don\u2019t see an argument for a particular regional bias in 2020. It seems more likely that global factors will either lift all boats, or provide equal challenges.", "2. A broader approach to diversification", "Despite historically low yields, we believe government bonds will still serve their purpose in a portfolio, which is to go up in price when stocks are falling. One of the key lessons of 2019 was that government bonds can still offer robust returns even when the starting yield is low. In October 2018 the euro government bond index yield, at 0.9%, was 2 percentage points lower than the US, but offered a similar return over the coming year (Exhibit 9). The 1% yield on the Austrian one-hundred year government bond is the clearest reminder to challenge ourselves when we think yields can\u2019t possibly get any lower.", "\u00a0", "While government bonds still provide insurance, they no longer provide real income. Indeed, negative yields in much of the core market in Europe mean that investors have to pay for the insurance core bonds provide.", "This leaves investors in a difficult quandary. Higher yields can be found, but only with increasing risk. On this basis it is noteworthy that the income on offer in core global infrastructure has remained robust, while yields on investment grade and high yield bonds have been compressed. The income from infrastructure investments has a better chance of cushioning total returns in a downturn, although investors do have to accept the liquidity risk that comes with real assets. Macro hedge funds may also have a role to play in portfolio diversification, given that their dynamic nature means they tend to adapt well in periods of heightened volatility (Exhibit 10).", "\u00a0", "3. An eye on the upside", "While our base case is more pessimistic, it is not outside the bounds of possibility that the geopolitical backdrop could improve in 2020. In which case, it makes sense to have some allocation towards areas of the market that would be the biggest beneficiaries (much like how an allocation to core bonds would work if the downside risks materialised). In our view, emerging Asia would see the most significant upside in the event of a trade resolution.", "Even if this short-term view doesn\u2019t play out, investors may need toconsider the investment opportunities in parts of the emerging world to bolster long-term returns. Quite simply, very few parts of the developed world have the capacity to deliver growth in excess of 2% because of demographic headwinds. The emerging world \u2013 particularly China \u2013 is not exempt from population pressures, but incomes are rising more rapidly and increasing numbers are reaching middle income status. More households are buying their first homes, cars and appliances, and using financial services. Investing in emerging economies requires careful selection, and even then investors should expect more volatility. But our assessment, as seen in our Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions, is that the emerging world offers returns well in excess of those seen in the developed world (Exhibit 11).", "\u00a0", "4. How inflation could upset returns in 2020", "Many of the key geopolitical risks have been discussed. But there is one scenario not yet mentioned that could truly upset the applecart in 2020: the return of inflation. While this isn\u2019t the most likely risk we face in 2020, it is worth considering because it would limit the ability of the central banks to continue to pursue aggressive preemptive supportive monetary policy.

LOW-RISK FIRST MORTGAGES", "The last few years have seen significant change in the Australian residential property market. A combination of regulatory change, a shift in bank lending practices, increasingly negative sentiment towards property investment and solid underlying fundamentals have created a risk/return imbalance.", "This imbalance means the investment returns from senior lending \u2013 or first mortgages \u2013 are very high due to a lack of lending alternatives, while the risk profile is low due to the security of quality assets with low leverage, creating the ultimate \u201cperfect storm\u201d investment.", "There are a couple of factors behind the changes in bank lending practices. Concerned about the financial stability of the banking sector, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) began implementing a variety of measures to address responsible bank lending in late 2014. These included limiting interest-only loans, to limiting excessive growth of investor lending and applying enhanced criteria to ensure the serviceability of loans.", "In addition to the regulatory measures, the focus on bank lending practices during the Banking Royal Commission has resulted in a tightening in lending criteria. This includes things such as lower lending limits, increased scrutiny of expenses, enhanced verification of income, more vigorous scenario stress testing, and greater incorporation of credit card limit details and other potential liabilities. In general terms, the loan application process has become more onerous and loans, if approved, are smaller than they once may have been.", "The measures have been very successful in improving the quality of new mortgage lending generally and moderating the growth in higher risk investor and interest-only lending, but they have also created a property financing void. Unsurprisingly, those lenders who are in a position to fill this void are also able to generate impressive investment returns.", "But attractive investment returns are just part of the story. The risk profile of senior lending is also constrained due to the priority ranking of senior debt and the prudent investment criteria applied. Merricks Capital further mitigates individual loan risk through a combination of moderate loan-to-valuation ratios (LVRs), adequate presale coverage, and high levels of borrower security, along with a rigorous property section process.", "The outlook for housing prices remains a key area of economic uncertainty and national dwelling prices were down 6.3% over the year to February, led by falls in Sydney (-10.4%) and Melbourne (-9.1%). While the falls have so far fitted with the \u201corderly adjustment\u201d description offered \u2013 and in fact engineered \u2013 by the Reserve Bank of Australia and other regulators, there is still no strong indication that the market has bottomed. Sentiment around housing is mixed \u2013 consumers expect to see further falls in housing prices but they are becoming more positive about the timing to buy. And while unemployment and interest rates remain low, serviceability of mortgages should remain resilient, providing key support for the market.", "Merricks Capital supports the outlook for an orderly rebalancing in housing prices, but by applying conservative LVRs to the loans in the portfolio (the average LVR in the Merricks Capital Partners fund is 58%), it would require a significant collapse in the underlying value of the property to have an investment impact. Similarly, Merricks avoids projects in areas subject to oversupply and bubble-like conditions and instead focuses on financing properties in areas with strong organic or underlying demand.", "Even in a soft housing market environment. the economics of financing construction and development projects makes a lot of sense. Low interest rates, population growth/high levels of immigration, a prior lack of housing supply and significant pent-up or \u201cunmet\u201d demand will ensure continued demand for housing stock.

The modesty of the Hayne\u2019s recommendations shows that the report stopped short of making any damaging recommendations to lending requirements or detrimental structural changes to the big banks.

As a result, Banks shares were hit hard over the year and old bad bank behaviour was on the way out. The real reason Hayne stopped short was to prevent a crushing credit squeeze followed by a housing collapse and economic slump. Unfortunately, those looking for blood from the banks, will be bitterly disappointed. It wasn\u2019t a brutal bank bashing recommendation. It was a reasonable and measured report. Perhaps Hayne recognised that it is dangerous to throw the baby out with the bathwater by implementing far-reaching structural change to our banking institutions because of the poor experience on a relatively minor share of customers, albeit those actions by the institutions were egregious in some cases. It is easy to form a view that the malaise was ubiquitous, but it was not, despite media coverage to the alternative.

On an absolute basis however, bank share prices have been quite resilient, dragged along by strong markets in general (in turn fuelled by lower interest rates).", "More recently the banks have had some better news.\u00a0 The (relatively) more friendly Coalition retained government in a surprise election win in May, removing some of the more dire downside risks around negative gearing and franking credits. APRA then eased some\u00a0of the macro-prudential restrictions around lending requirements, and the housing market has seen prices stabilise and even increase in some areas. Also, we have seen some funding cost pressures ease from earlier in the year.\u00a0 Immediately post-election we saw a strong bank sector bounce.\u00a0 Whilst they gave some of that relative performance back in the following months, they have largely held their own versus a surging market and have now matched the overall index performance since March this year. Does this consolidation phase indicate a turn in fortunes or just a breather before resuming the downtrend?", "The answer isn\u2019t that simple unfortunately. Bank valuation measures have likely never been this divided.", "If we are purely valuing banks on a relative basis, i.e. relative to bond yields or cash, or relative to other sectors, then banks appear to be quite good value on historical averages, largely as a result of the extremes of what we are comparing to.", "However, we are in extraordinary times for many asset values, and so on an absolute basis, i.e. price to earnings, or price to book value (compared to returns generated), they do not look to be good value at all compared to history.", "Looking at relative valuations first.\u00a0 Often bank dividend yields get compared to bond yields as an alternative (although the answer is the same if compared to cash rates or even bank deposit rates).\u00a0 Given the collapse in bond yields, bank dividends, particularly when grossed up for franking, appear quite attractive.\u00a0 You can currently get around 1.0% 10 year government bond yield or an average 6% fully franked bank dividend yield, (>8.0% gross yield) \u2013 which looks attractive. The downside to this measure is that spot yield comparison doesn\u2019t tell you anything about the risk to that yield for banks (elevated), the potential growth in those dividends (non-existent), capital requirements to fund those yields (increasing), nor anything around the multitude of regulatory risks the banks face.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "So, to answer the question on whether banks are cheap enough to buy now, you need a strong view on where bond yields go from here and how the rest of the market performs, because it is hard to see too many positives from a bank specific earnings point of view to drive the sector. We are hardly about to enter an earnings upgrade cycle for banks for example. If we could get more comfortable on earnings, we would be more comfortable on valuations. Even holding earnings here versus a falling market may be enough. However, it is increasingly becoming a relative call rather than a fundamental one.", "The key issue for banks is that their earnings remain under pressure on both revenues and costs.\u00a0 Very low and falling interest rates are increasingly making life very tough for bank earnings with much of that yet to play out.", "Whilst there has been some removal of lending restrictions on banks, and a recent increase in mortgage applications, overall lending growth for the majors remains weak owing to an uncertain economic environment, low housing sales volumes, absence of foreign investors, continued high consumer leverage and importantly, market share loss to the smaller players and non-banks.\u00a0 Banks are also still adjusting their approval processes to meet both regulatory and community standards around responsible lending and verifying customer expenses.\u00a0 This continues to weigh on supply, although perhaps less today than it did a few months ago.\u00a0 Also, low interest rates mean people pay down their loans faster, further pressuring net volumes. Should supply and demand improve further and prove sustainable (rather than just a short term bounce off low levels), that could be a positive change for the banks relative to recent history.", "On the cost side,\u00a0", "regulatory expenses continue to rise at a rapid rate", ".\u00a0 Via increased risk and compliance people and enhanced systems the regulators continue to demand more, especially in the wake of the Royal Commission and various bank run-ins with the regulator.

If we look to countries like the UK as a precedent, it would suggest these costs can persist for a lot longer and be much higher than expected.

This relates to the amount of debts that go bad. Historically, and given the size of bank lending, this is the line that can cause the biggest volatility and really impact dividends. Given a combination of very low interest rates, high asset prices and low unemployment, the banks have enjoyed a bit of a golden era in terms of very low and falling loan losses. This has helped earnings for a number of years as provisions fell and write-backs continued.\u00a0 It does appear as if this help has now stopped, but it is yet to become a material headwind. All the banks are currently reporting significantly lower losses than normal. At some point those losses will deteriorate. Even if only marginally, given very low earnings growth, some deterioration will be a decent headwind to growth (and possibly dividends in the extreme). This does not appear to be a near term issue, but when valuing banks, it is worth remembering that bank sustainable earnings are actually overstated at the moment due to low losses.", "We remain positioned underweight the sector for now.", "Attractive relative valuations restrain us from becoming too negative on the sector, as you likely get occasional bouts of bank relative performance on \u2018valuation\u2019 or defensive grounds (depending on the tweet of the day, no doubt!). Equally it is hard getting excited about these relative valuations, when absolute valuations are so stretched, and we see continued earnings pressure near term.\u00a0 It is likely that over time the weak earnings outcomes will continue to drive underperformance, as will continued negative regulatory headlines. Whilst bank return on equity has consistently fallen for many years now to their lowest levels since the early 1990\u2019s, it is still very difficult to definitively say where they will bottom out, or where regulators, the government or the community will let them settle.\u00a0 It is hard to imagine consistent outperformance in that environment.", "We would become even more negative if we saw a pick up in bad and doubtful debts, although these cycles play out over long time frames and whilst we expect minor pick up from historically low levels, we don\u2019t see anything material on the near-term horizon.\u00a0 We would become more interested in the sector if we saw their relative earnings outcomes stacking up well versus other sectors, and the downgrades stopped and turned to upgrades.", "It is worth pointing out here as well that historically there has been (on average) an inverse correlation in performance of the two large sectors in the market, banks and resources, i.e. one tends to outperform when the other underperforms.\u00a0 This is partially macro related (different conditions suit their earnings differently), but also cash flow related whereby investors tend to fund one with the other depending on their relative attractiveness. For much of the last three years, industry conditions for resources \u2013 especially the iron ore companies \u2013 have been favourable, making the difference to the banks even more stark. However, since the trade war rhetoric picked up earlier in 2019 and global growth slowed further, the outlook for the sector has become more uncertain. This is another factor we need to consider when looking at the banks from a portfolio construction perspective.", "On a bank-specific basis, in general we continue to see better relative value and earnings prospects in the business banks (e.g. NAB) as opposed to the retail or mortgage banks (e.g. CBA), although it must be said they all have issues that concern us.\u00a0 The business banks have relatively less exposure to the geared consumer and housing, and as such less exposure to the tougher parts of the market currently.\u00a0 We also favour banks that are firmly focussed on their cost base and responding to the current environment.\u00a0 We believe flat-to-negative cost outcomes are likely required to combat a tough top line and to grow earnings. This again steers us more towards the business banks currently.", "We acknowledge that a lot of bad news has played out for the banks already, meaning we are very alert to stabilisation in news flow or earnings impacts, or even slightly more positive tones that would be positive for bank performance. However, it is still hard to see a more positive environment in the near term with interest rates falling, a focus on capital levels, ongoing regulatory scrutiny and in some cases, dividends remaining under the spotlight.\u00a0 We know a negative credit cycle will come eventually and that would make things even worse when banks are already stretched.

Interest rates in places like Europe and Japan have been at ultra-low levels for many years and have not helped these economies alleviate their stagnant growth. This paper discusses why ultra-low rates are not necessarily working \u2013 in fact, how they may actually be counterproductive to the RBA\u2019s objectives.", "In its attempts to further prolong Australia\u2019s record-breaking, 28-year economic expansion and because Australian inflation remains below its 2% \u2018target\u2019, the RBA is now resorting to cutting interest rates to the bone. Many are even suggesting that the RBA may resort to quantitative easing at some stage to stimulate the Australian economy if the central bank\u2019s continued rate cuts do not lead to a pick-up in economic growth and jobs in Australia.", "The truth is that the RBA has joined the world\u2019s central banks in conducting an experiment. Their paradigm is that the economy will benefit from policies based on economic theories that, in reality, have previously resulted in major imbalances and have frequently ended in crises: the technology boom and bust, the housing boom and mortgage financing bust in the US followed by a global financial crisis, and several other booms and busts such as those experienced in Iceland, Spain, and Ireland. \u00a0The common theme in all these events is easy access to very cheap credit.", "\u00a0", "Raising and lowering interest rates \u2013 the price of money \u2013 is popularly believed to stimulate or slow an economy and, in the short term, this is almost certainly true. \u00a0In the longer term, however, a continual bias toward stimulating the economy in this manner often has the reverse effect in that imbalances and bubbles are eventually fostered and that the economic growth temporarily created proves unsustainable.", "Lower interest rates clearly reduce mortgage repayments and, if consumers spend this interest savings, it will give the economy a short-term boost. The more important aspect of lowering interest rates is to greatly encourage the corporate sector to borrow more with the aim of expanding their enterprises by building new productive facilities \u2013 like new mines or factories \u2013 as this results in more jobs and sustained wealth creation in the longer term.", "One of the many problems with most economic theories is that they assume you can adjust one factor and nothing else changes except what you intend to be affected by your adjustment. \u00a0In isolation, lowering interest rates should encourage companies to use cheap debt to borrow to invest by building factories or to fund more investment in R&D and innovation with the aim of lifting the longer-term productive capacity.", "\u00a0", "It is often said that interest rates are a very blunt tool and, in the real world, ultra-low interest rates can actually act counter to the intentions of what many central banks \u2013 including the RBA \u2013 seek to achieve.
