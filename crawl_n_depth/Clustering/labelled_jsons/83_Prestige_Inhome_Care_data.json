Ensure the company is reputable", "\u201cUnfortunately, anyone can create a good looking website. When researching, make sure you dig deeper to find out specific details, and make sure you answer these questions: How long has the company existed? Where do they operate? Do they have resources to help you get in touch with them when you need them, not just a call centre? Do they have credible, legitimate testimonials from other clients? These simple steps will help you find a credible provider,\u201d says Nick.", "2. Watch the fees please", "\u201cOnce you have found what looks like a credible provider the next step is to identify their fee structure,\u201d said Nick. \u201cThe key thing here is to look for inflated administration fees or other unnecessary case management or exit fees that eat into the dollars that could go towards care. Make sure you pay no more than 15% for admin fees, and don\u2019t spend a cent on case management unless it is a service you need and wish to pay for. Also be aware of any exit fees you may be charged if you decide to leave that provider at some stage.\u201d", "3. Is the care there?", "\u201cThe reason In Home Care is popular is that individuals are able to remain in their homes within the comfort of their surrounds. However, to experience the true advantages of in-home care you need to be able to recognise what a high standard of care looks like. Ask yourself, do I feel good as a result of my Home Care provider? Do I genuinely feel cared for? Are they doing everything they can to make my life easier? If you answer no to any of those questions, you have not found the right provider to suit your needs,\u201d says Nick.", "4. What are people saying?", "\u201cListen to the opinions of others and explore the reputation of the provider,\u201d says Nick. \u201cLook beyond pre-prepared testimonials on their website? A quick google search of the provider\u2019s name should bring up some independent reviews or testimonials to help you make an informed decision.\u201d", "5. Don\u2019t be afraid to switch", "\u201cUnhappy with a provider? Switching is now easy and seamless and moving to the right provider will save you money and put you in charge again,\u201d says Nick.", "Why choose Prestige?\u00a0", "CLICK HERE", "Choice, Privacy, Reliability.", "LEARN MORE", "A Consultant will visit you at home to discuss your needs and tailor a solution for you and your family.", "BOOK CONSULTATION", "Call ", "1300 10 30 10", " to have your questions answered by a friendly, knowledgeable professional..", "We try to update our social links as much as we can, please feel free and drop by our social media.

There are a number of complex social and cultural reasons for this, but there are also a number of simple reasons, such as the higher likelihood of Indigenous Australians living in remote communities away from the metropolitan hub of healthcare services, or healthcare services not being culturally appropriate for indigenous people. Services are often subconsciously designed for non-indigenous Australians, and as a result are not always accessible or user friendly for the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community.", "This situation is somewhat ironic because, perhaps even more unfortunately, studies also show that levels of Indigenous health in Australia are consistently lower than they are for non-indigenous citizens. Their life expectancy at birth is approximately ten years lower than it is for non-indigenous Australians, and they are more likely to suffer from potentially fatal conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, mental health issues, kidney disease, injury or accidents, communicable diseases and respiratory health problems.", "On the surface level these higher rates of health problems have been linked to things like nutrition, physical activity, tobacco use, alcohol use, and drug use. However, in reality the reasons are far more complicated. They are deeply ingrained in social, cultural, historical, and political issues that must be combated if we expect these rates to improve.", "As a healthcare provider, Prestige Inhome Care is passionate about the need to deliver competent and tailored services to indigenous Australians, particularly in the aged care sector.
