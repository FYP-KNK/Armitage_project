Actuators with plastic housings are suitable for a wide range of applications, though mainly indoor ones. Aluminium housings help protect an actuator from harsh environments, such as fluctuating temperatures, chemicals and the effects of high forces and vibrations.", "The design of actuator housings is highly influential when it comes to the endurance of actuators. For example, the back fixture can either be welded as part of the housing itself, or be a separate stainless steel back-fixture attached to the housing.", "In either of these cases, the push/pull forces created when moving a load will travel differently through the actuator and its housing. Actuators handling higher loads are usually designed with a separate back fixture to ensure that the housing is not directly exposed to the force. Higher loads in combination with vibrations can damage the housing and reduce the actuator\u2019s ingress protection.", "Actuators made for operation in harsh environments, such as high or low temperatures, corroding chemicals, or vibrations, must therefore be designed accordingly. LINAK industrial actuators include several features that help ensure their durability and the highest possible Ingress Protection rating (IP69K): aluminum housings, coated PCBs to protect the electronics, polished inner tubes to reduce the moisture ingress, specially selected cork sealings for harsh environments and dust explosive environments (ATEX and IECEx).", "Finally, the surface of aluminum housings for LINAK industrial actuators is resistant to corrosion, and cables are easily exchanged without compromising the actuator\u2019s IP rating.

The iron bars used for LINAK spindles are carefully selected before rolling the spindle threads.", "Which spindle type and spindle nut to select depends on the load and performance requirements of the actuator. For example, a long spindle nut is better for lifting heavier loads. To obtain a long and reliable service life for actuators with high spindle pitches, more tracks are added to efficiently distribute the forces from the industrial application to the spindle and the nut.", "The core diameter of the actuator spindle (not including the tracks) determines the strength of the spindle, thus the actuator.", "A spindle pitch is the linear distance a nut travels, rotating once (360 degrees) around a spindle. A high spindle pitch entails a higher actuator efficiency as there is less friction between the nut and the spindle. But, a high spindle pitch also means a lower self-locking ability. Self-locking means that the actuator does not backdrive while stopped at a target position. Linear spindle actuators that are not self-locking require a brake in order to keep them in a fixed position.", "Because of the spindle and its shape, an electric actuator will always provide the same efficiency output, regardless of the load applied. Also, regardless of the load, speed will not vary between push and pull movement. When selecting an actuator, a rule of thumb is to multiply the load by the speed to calculate the power needed for the right movement solution.", "When considering actuators with long stroke lengths in push, the maximum load specification is typically reduced to decrease the strain on the actuator.", "Finally, actuators operating machinery with high safety requirements often have a safety nut added.
