While the changes to the law will mean that a judge or magistrate will generally start with the presumption that the parents will have joint parental responsibility, one or both parents can submit that this is not appropriate in a particular case. The best interests of the child will remain the most important factor to be taken into account. The primary factors in determining the best interests of the child will be the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents and the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm.", "The government agrees with this recommendation in relation to cases involving violence or child abuse.

Making entrenched conflict a ground for applying a presumption against joint parental responsibility could mean the courts would rarely be able to apply the proposed new presumption in favour of joint parental responsibility.

The amendments should be child-focused and so will refer to the need to ensure that children are given the opportunity for their parents to have a meaningful involvement in their lives to the maximum extent possible, consistent with their best interests.

Changes to the Act will require mediators, counsellors, and legal advisers to provide information about what a parenting plan is, the possible content of such a plan and appropriate organisations or individuals who can assist in the development of parenting plans.

The centres themselves will provide dispute resolution and will also refer parents to other mediation, counselling or specialist services they may need. Information, advice and referral services will be free. The first three hours of dispute resolution will also be free. There will be flexibility for parents who need more time to help them reach agreement. They will be able to continue either at the centre or at a dispute resolution service that best suits their needs. Like existing mediation and counselling services funded by the government, some parents will get additional services for free and others who can afford it, will pay for these services.", "Rather than being attached to a government agency, the government considers that the non-government sector is better placed to provide these services. The Family Relationship Centres will be run by a variety of non-government organisations but will be a national service network with nationally consistent goals and standards. It will be supported by a national telephone advice line and website.", "The government does not agree with this recommendation.

The government will also introduce new accreditation standards for family counsellors and dispute resolution practitioners that will include skills in screening for such issues.", "The 2005-06 Budget also included new funding of $7 million to enhance the capacity of the sector to deliver specialised family violence services.", "The government notes the committee\u2019s concerns about the need for allegations of violence and child abuse to be investigated in a timely and credible manner. As the Families Tribunal is not part of this response, the option of an investigative arm of such a tribunal is not available. The government considers that, to avoid duplication, better coordination of the family law system and State and Territory child protection systems is a preferable mechanism rather than establishing additional investigative bodies. It is important that the States and Territories fulfil their obligations in respect to investigating child abuse.", "As reported by the committee, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General agreed on 8 August 2003 to establish a working group to look at ways of better coordinating the Commonwealth\u2019s family law system with child protection systems at State and Territory levels.

The establishment of the Family Relationship Centres and implementation of other elements of its family law reform package will help to achieve this goal.", "The government agrees that the way separating families interact with the family court system should be simplified but does not consider that one federal court with family law jurisdiction be established.

The two courts are working together to implement this reform. The combined registry will provide information about the family courts and help people navigate the court system.

The new combined registry will work closely with Family Relationship Centres and other services to ensure that separating families have the best possible opportunity to resolve their disputes outside the courts.", "The government agrees with this recommendation.

To this end, the government will ensure that staff of Family Relationship Centres are trained to provide family conferencing, a form of dispute resolution which includes other family members as well as the parents.
