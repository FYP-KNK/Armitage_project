Unfortunately that did not go to well for me but what did go well is that I met Kathy. In 1982 I decided to study part time and was lucky enough to get a job at the then Department of Agriculture as an Auditor. Over my years in the Government I moved to Corrective Services and then ended up at the State Revenue Department. In 1989 I took long service leave and then resigned as I was helping support my father who eventually passed away of cancer. Around the same time I was approached by a friend who I had worked with to join him in a technology venture. Over the next twenty years I saw the commencement and the scale of technology develop in our society. I remember having to load a tape into a computer and being amazed when the tiny\u00a0orange screen lit up. I still wish that I had not thrown away the original Apple Mac (that had signatures from all the Apple staff (including Steve Jobs) who created it on the inside of the cover). I have held many positions over this time. I had been the Apple representative for WA when I worked for a wholesale company, Webmaster (impressive title) for the world\u2019s largest mining portal, Australian sales champ for a fortune 500 company, helped raise capital for mining and technology ventures, supported very small to local ", "(like RIO, BHP)\u00a0", "and international corporate businesses (like Tiffany the Jewellers) and of course including Government Departments and their agencies.

Unsure what I would find I suggested that I could help for approximately two days a week. What I found was a waiting list of over three hundred clients (with some having waited for over two years to see someone at KZ Speech). The solution was easy! Hire more staff! Moving forward KZ Speech now has well over twenty Therapists, Therapy Assistants and Administrative Staff supporting hundreds of families in the Gascoyne, Wheatbelt, Great Southern and of course Perth regions.

I am passionate about what we do and the amazing results that the practice continually achieves. I have tried many things at KZ Speech and value that we are so dynamic and able to adapt new theories and technologies as they come out into the practice. This, I feel, has enabled so many external professionals, organisations (private and Government) and of course clients to increasingly refer KZ Speech to their clients or friends.
