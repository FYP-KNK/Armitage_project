It\u2019s what all the \u2018cool kids\u2019 and the \u2018hipsters\u2019 are doing, but what really is it? When I first came across mindfulness I thought it was all about people sitting cross-legged, humming in a circle. I quickly decided it wasn\u2019t for me, but this is not what it is! Mindfulness can be done by anyone, any age, anywhere and in almost any activity. Mindfulness is a way of being aware of our own thoughts and feelings and learning to live in the present moment to clear our minds of anything else. It can be adapted to suit any given problem and can be used by children and adults in a range of ways, depending on the setting.", "Here are just some of the areas mindful activities can provide support:", "1 \u2013 Anxiety", "\nWe live in a fast-paced, technological world where children are constantly faced with new experiences and challenges. Sometimes children may be unsure how to cope with these stressors and can demonstrate fearful or anxious behaviours. It\u2019s a natural reaction to want to protect your child from things that make them anxious, but avoiding the anxiety trigger can make things worse as it may reinforce our anxieties. A little bit of stress and anxiety is ok but when that anxiety stops your child engaging and participating in the things they need or want to do, mindfulness is here to help. Mindfulness helps children focus on the present moment and temporarily forget about their worries (this can be anywhere from 60 seconds \u2013 60 minutes depending on the mindful activity and how new you are to mindfulness). Try our mindful glitter bottle activity below to help your child manage anxious behaviours or worries!", "2 \u2013 Pain Management", "\nLiving with chronic pain from illness or injury can be an emotional and physical strain. Children can experience feelings of frustration, anger and depression due to the pain they experience daily. Although medication can be useful to manage their pain, sometimes they may need something extra to help them feel like they are in control. Mindfulness can be this \u2018something extra\u2019. It can help to change the way their mind perceives the pain, making it more bearable to live with. \u2018Body scanning\u2019 activities have been shown to be really beneficial for pain management strategies in children and adults. Why not try using our mindful glitter bottle activity to help your child deal with the thoughts and worries associated with their pain.", "3 \u2013 Bullying", "\nBullying and cyber-bulling is becoming more and more prevalent everyday across Australia and the world. No parent wants to see their child get bullied or for their child to become the bully. Mindfulness and focusing on the \u2018now\u2019 can be used as a way to reduce and prevent bullying. It has been shown as an effective management tool for the victims, bullies and witnesses by helping them develop a greater awareness of themselves, their feelings and giving them a greater ability to regulate their emotional responses to events. The culture of bullying is based on reactive behaviours: children often bully others as a way of gaining control over external events happening in their lives and their own feelings of powerlessness; those who are victims to bullying can react in ways that perpetuate bullying as the bullies receive the reactions they are seeking. Are you worried your child is being bullied or becoming a bully? Use our mindful glitter bottle to provide a calm, safe and supportive environment for your child, offering them the opportunity to open up and let go of any negative feelings they have experienced recently or in the past.", "4 \u2013 Sleep", "\nIs getting to sleep a common problem for your child? Bed time is when the mind can come alive, whether you want it to or not! Having a poor night of sleep can have a detrimental effect on your child and waking them up to get ready for school can seem an impossible mission! They then get sent off to school with their internal battery only partly charged, possibly leading to difficulties focusing and paying attention in class, poor control of their emotions and also possible increased conflicts with their peers. So how can you help your child get a better night of sleep? Mindfulness of course!

Do they find it hard to differentiate between different feelings? The capacity to do this is known as \u2018emotional intelligence\u2019: the ability to identify and manage our own emotions and the emotions of others. Mindfulness helps increase \u2018emotional intelligence\u2019. It can improve how children understand their own emotions. Mindfulness increases a child\u2019s ability to control their emotions and also supports them to recognise the emotions of those around them. Take the first step to develop your child\u2019s emotional intelligence with the mindful glitter bottle. You can use the glitter bottle to discuss your child\u2019s feelings and help them understand that their emotions (positive or negative!), are valid and learning how to deal with them makes a big difference.", "6 \u2013 Educational pressures", "\nStarting a new school, going into a new year group, homework and exam time can be overwhelming for any child! There are so many worries involved around school and education. Worries and the increasing educational demands on children can make school a negative experience and this can inhibit learning for children. Have you ever found that your child comes home from a busy day at school and just \u2018explodes\u2019 or has a \u2018meltdown\u2019? Mindfulness can help provide a coping strategy to reduce these behaviours and help your child to deal with worries. Try and make time in your morning and evening routine for the mindful glitter bottle. It only needs to be as little as 60 seconds to start with! You can encourage your child to learn this coping strategy in a safe environment, so it can then be transferred into the more demanding school environment on a daily basis.", "7 \u2013 Relationships", "\nIt\u2019s common for people to tell me they feel they don\u2019t spend enough time with their children. In today\u2019s society everyone seems to be constantly on the go and consequently making time for \u2018quality time\u2019 seems to get pushed to one side as there\u2019s always something else we should be doing! Our to-do lists are endless! Mindfulness can help strengthen the relationships children have with others as it\u2019s a quick and easy way for them to sit with an adult and be mindful together. Besides, who couldn\u2019t do with an extra few minutes of peace and quiet in their day?! Having this extra few minutes every day, just for you and your child, will not only increase your bond but also strengthen your child\u2019s ability to form emotional connections with others. You can try introducing the mindful glitter bottle into your daily routine. Perhaps you can sit down with your child as soon as you get in from the school run, or when you get in from work. When you do it isn\u2019t important, but just spending that few minutes together can make a massive difference to your child\u2019s overall wellbeing!", "The more often you and your child can practice being mindful, the more beneficial it will be to you both. Remember, there doesn\u2019t have to be a \u2018problem\u2019 in your child\u2019s life before you practice mindfulness.
