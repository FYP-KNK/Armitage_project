The tones are presented at different sound levels to then record the lowest level at which a person can hear. This is called the threshold limit. The audiometric testing is conducted for different frequencies and for the right ear and then the left ear.", "Prior to the audiometric testing, an otoscopic inspection is conducted by looking through what is essentially a magnifying glass to view the condition of the outer ear and the tympanic membrane or commonly known as the ear drum. This assists to identify pathologies, or disease other than the potential for workplace hearing loss.", "The benefits of regular audiometric testing are to remove people who are at risk of significant hearing loss by identifying changes in their hearing threshold. Audiometric testing during monitoring is best conducted at least a few hours into their shift to identify any Temporary Threshold Shift (TTS). Temporary Threshold Shifts identify that the Personal Hearing Protection and noise reduction strategies are not working effectively and immediate corrective action is required.", "Audiometric testing may also assist in diagnosing forms of cancers that may not otherwise be picked up or assist in disease other than workplace hearing loss. \u00a0Typical hearing loss as a result of Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) often occurs at the 3K, 4K & 6K frequencies where a V shape notch is observed when viewed on the audiometric graph, known as an audiogram.", "Keep up to ", "date...", "\r\n    ", "\r\n", "\r\n    ", "\r\n", "\r\n\t", "\r\n", "Sydney", "Phone 02 9621 3706", "Unit 4, 40 Bessemer Street", "Blacktown NSW 2148", "Sydney@SafeEnvironments.com.au", "Melbourne", "Phone 03 9604 0700", "Level 7, 552 Lonsdale Street", "Melbourne Victoria 3000", "Melbourne@SafeEnvironments.com.au", " ", "Website Design by ", "The Web Showroom", " ", "|", " ", "Sitemap", " ", "|", " ", "Unsubscribe", " ", "|", " ", "Privacy Policy", " ", "|", " \u00a9 2015 Safe Environment", "Safe Environments prides itself on the quality of its tests and reports for all statutory and regulatory requirements.", "Our team of industry leading, accredited experts have experience across a range of industries to help provide cost-effective solutions to improve your workplace health and safety, and compliance.", "read more", "To receive a quote or to speak with one our consultants, please leave your", "\ndetails below.

As a consequence, a method of modifying the noise exposure is calculated affects the reported daily noise exposure.", "Other factors such as Hand Arm Vibration (HAV) and ototoxic agents increase the risk of industrial deafness associated with high noise levels. Hand Arm Vibration appears to have a sympathetic reflex to the blood flow to the cochlear within the ear due to noise.

If the Personal hearing Protection (PHP) is too great, then this tends to isolate the worker from their environment. This protection from noise may make a person unaware of a forklift, crane or truck. The end result could be disastrous. What we though was protecting us from noise, was actually what we needed! Workers need to be aware of warning tones and noises in their environment for their safety. The hearing protection and situational awareness needs to be optimised to ensure safety in the workplace as well as protecting workers from Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL).", "The NSW WHS Regulations require audiometric testing to be conducted at least once every two years when people are exposed to noise.

The width of the strips should be between 50-75mm, this assists persons to negotiate the stairs by clearly delineating the step edge, thus minimising the risk of a miss-step on the stairs. This is increasingly important when people\u2019s eyes require time to adapt to lower lighting conditions.

It has been found that the RCOF of safe stair descent during weight acceptance is approximately 0.26 . Thus in the absence of contaminants on the stair tread, frictional factors play a minor role in stair safety during descent for internal stairs that are maintained in a clean and dry condition, unless subjects wear poor footwear, resulting in low coefficients of friction. For external stairs and transitional areas in entrances, the slip resistance can be a significant factor and stair treads should achieve Pendulum Class W for public areas where water contamination is likely, when tested to AS/NZS 4586, ", "Slip Resistance Classification of Pedestrian Surface Materials", ". Any slip resistant strips must be installed to the edge of the nosing as when a person descends a flight of stairs, with an approximate going of 250mm, the foot tends to make contact within 5 mm from the step edge.", "The provision of handrails provides a visual clue that there are steps present to negotiate. Handrails reduce the risk of a miss-step by increasing postural stability and assisting as a fall restraint. The Building Code of Australia (BCA) provides limited prescriptive requirements on handrail design. Besides the handrail height above the step best practice is for the railing is to be semicircular, with not less than 30 mm or more than 50 mm diameter for not less than 270\u00ba around the upper surface that does not tend to break a handhold. This handrail arrangement provides a power grip, which encompasses the majority of the handrail assisting fall arrest, rather than a relying on a pinch grip.", "The dimensional geometry of stairs should establish a suitable gait pattern that is consistent throughout the flight of stairs. For commercial premises the BCA requirements are that dimensions of stair risers be between 115 \u2013 190 mm and stair goings between 250 \u2013 355 mm. An attempt should be made for stair goings to be greater than 300 mm as the risk of over stepping over the edge of the stair is significantly reduced. The stair going to riser ratio (2R + G) within the range of 550 \u2013 700 assists to promote a suitable gait pattern.", "Dimensional inconsistency of stair going and risers can have a tremendous impact on a persons gait and balance, and are generally not visually obvious. Stairs with an irregularity as little as 6 mm between adjacent rise and runs can disrupt foot movements enough to cause a fall. A person has an expectation of a certain distance at which to place their foot at each step. If their expectation is not met, a fall can result from a misstep.
