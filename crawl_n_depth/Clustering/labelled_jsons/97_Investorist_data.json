The wholesale property market has forever had to battle with discrepancies in size, a lack of comparable sales data and then those little rippers that are so incredibly miscalculated or reported that the only thing you can do is shake your head and throw your hands in the air with exasperation.", "One can lose a lot of sleep trying to understand (or even find patterns) in the way that valuations are conducted. I\u2019ve literally had valuations on the exact same apartment from the same valuation firm in the same week come back $40k apart. After many attempts to address this phenomenon, instead of dwelling on it or trying to battle and overturn valuations; I just decided to accept that I\u2019d never win. So I adopted another strategy. I educated my client. I conditioned them not only to expect a valuation shortfall but taught them why this occurred and gave them full clarity on the matter. Not just talking about the banks protecting their own substantial rear ends, but educating them about the GST and its implications.", "In all my years working in the wholesale property industry, in my opinion, GST in valuations is still an area that a lot of people simply don\u2019t understand and more importantly, don\u2019t use to their advantage. Here is a cheat sheet:", "Who pays GST on new properties?", "I\u2019m sure everyone in this industry has seen and read a valuation report that has been issued via Valex many times; but what they may not have noticed is the section marked GST.", "Due to the fact that the vast majority of real estate transactions occurring in Australia are between two consumers on an existing property (John and Mary purchase Greg and Maggie\u2019s house), there is no GST payable. However, when John and Mary buy a new off-the-plan property from Danny the developer, the first thing Danny must do is hand over 1/11th of the contract price to the ATO as the GST component of the sale.", "An example of how GST affects buyers", "Why is it important for buyers and their advisors to understand the GST implications? Here\u2019s an example:", "Let\u2019s say John and Mary\u2019s off the plan apartment costs $500,000. Let\u2019s assume their (smart) mortgage broker has accounted for a 10% shortfall in valuation at settlement, and therefore factors in a 10% buffer in funding because he knows the GST component can\u2019t be accounted for in the valuation. On completion, the valuation comes in 8% light of the purchase price, at just $460,000 (in the average range of valuation shortfalls I experienced for Victorian and Queensland properties). John and Mary understand that this is due to the GST. Thanks to the buffer included in their funding arrangements, they can settle on the apartment with no problem. Without this buffer, they could potentially find themselves $40,000 short, and at risk of settlement default.", "I could be wrong in thinking that a lot of the industry still isn\u2019t aware of these GST implications, but it never seems to come up in conversation when valuation shortfalls and settlement risks are discussed. Having a good understanding of this area and expecting a shortfall of 10% on every valuation made my settlement process so much smoother and my clients have always been comfortable with the shortfalls if and when they eventuated.", "Settlement default is an ever-present risk in this industry (increasing or decreasing according to the prevailing market conditions), and it has severe implications for all stakeholders \u2013 the buyer, the developer, the mortgage broker, the sales agent, the bank and the solicitor. We used to refer to it as \u2018the crash rate\u2019. By way of underlining the importance of this strategy, my personal crash rate went from 13% to 2% after I began educating my clients about GST.", "If you\u2019re in the business of developing, selling or financing off the plan property, that\u2019s one rate cut I\u2019m sure you too would like to see.", "(1) GST Valuation Rule", "Valuations of residential property for mortgage security purposes are undertaken on the basis that GST is not applicable. This valuation is prepared on the assumption that the subject property does not constitute a \u2018new residential property\u2019 as defined under ATO Ruling GSTR 2003/3.

The second group going west are the Chinese developers, who face limited development potential within the China market. They are attracted by the profit of project development in overseas markets, and wherever the Chinese want to buy and live, they will follow. Now Chinese developers are frequently seen in popular Chinese immigration cities such as New York, London, Sydney, Melbourne, etc. This action prompted the domestic agents who used to sell for their Chinese projects locally to join the journey \u00a0west,\u00a0 becoming the third business force.

Is it feasible for this trading platform for off the plan to serve clients all around the globe?", "Compared with property purchase in China, overseas purchase often involve more complicated issues such as language barriers, legal policies and offsite loans etc.. In Australia, transactions of newly built properties also rely on professional service because while real estate developers prefer agency sale to direct sale to clients, buyers are also inclined to use professional services from real estate agencies.", "For this reason, Ellis decided to target professionals like real estate developers, sales agencies, financial planner and lawyers as users of Investorist.

According to Rebecca Zhao, International Marketing Executive of Investorist, \u201cInvestorist has built up online a sales network beyond languages and regional boundaries, at an extreme low cost.

For real estate agencies and financial planners on the other side, Investorist gathers large amount of Australian off the plan stocks that can be searched and inquired whenever and wherever possible. Also, it helps agents to consult with real estate developers directly about sales commissions.", "The transaction mode of Investorist is very simple and direct.

After receiving the order, property developers shall call the buyer to confirm more details and lock relevant properties to ensure the users who make the reservation have priority in purchasing the unit within certain amount of time. Once the reservation is confirmed, the buyer should first pay 10 percent as deposit into a trust account supervised by both the Australian government. \u201cBefore the completion and key-handover of the apartment, the deposit shall not be paid to the developer.\u201d Rebecca explained.", "In terms of business model, Investorist does not profit from agents\u2019 commission but from platform services fees.

In normal practice, overseas real estate agencies are sub-agents to sell stocks distributed by Australian local agents who source stocks from local developers and their projects.

It is still a \u201cnewcomer\u201d to the Australian property industry. Some Chinese agents may have not heard about it or have used it. But after a trial, the experience will change their mind and addict to it.\u201d He is personally very optimistic about this new business platform, and believes it shall gradually replace the traditional rules.", "Observing the strong buying power from Chinese investors purchasing the Australian properties, Jon decided that Investorist should strengthen its focus on the mainland China market.
