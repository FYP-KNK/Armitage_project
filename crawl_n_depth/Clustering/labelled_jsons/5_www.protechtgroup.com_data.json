The complexity of reporting obligations combined with the need for better document management, data security and effective communication has created the need for financial services firms (\u201cFSFs\u201d) to use technology as a means for better managing and running their compliance program. This article explores how FSFs, and any other regulated entity, can benefit from integrating technology to create a more effective and efficient compliance management process within the organisation.", "The ease of managing, searching and retaining important company documents for minimum time periods is a critical requirement that must be met by all FSFs. Regulatory standards, internal policies and procedures that are crucial to the business are best centralised in one location for ease of access by staff. Manual procedures and controls that are used to facilitate document management processes are a notorious source of operational risk as it often leads to inaccuracies due to human error. The risk is heightened when the volume of data dealt with is significant. The variety of data management tools available through modern technology these days allow FSFs to address these shortcomings as processes and controls can be automated. Additionally, large volumes of data can be dealt with uniformity and particularity resulting in increased efficiency and accuracy. This not only reduces manual oversight, but provides the ability for FSFs to easily organise and manage the lifecycle of documents.", "Periodic communication on regulatory updates, policies and procedures is also a fundamental aspect of running a good compliance program. Consistent enforcement of the program and regular compliance training is equally important to ensure that staff are well equipped with the relevant knowledge. Nowadays, software systems can be developed to disseminate this information and automate reminders to provide awareness and timely action that may be required. For example, the use of an online calendar can serve as a useful reminder for compliance related events whereas the provision of online user training may be an effective tool for educating and keeping staff knowledge up to date. The ongoing monitoring and testing of compliance policies and procedures is also essential to warrant the viability of a compliance program. Apart from the need to document test results, compliance gaps and corrective actions identified from the testing phase are much easier communicated and tracked for progress electronically.", "Technological intervention also makes the month-end reporting process more efficient and accurate. GRC-based systems, such as ", "Protecht.ERM", ", permit a more complex analysis of information through data mining and analytics. Dashboard reporting has become increasingly prevalent these days as it is highly interactive and able to provide real-time information regarding the business\u2019 compliance performance. Role-based dashboards can be easily produced to the Board to display the overall compliance of the business and if any, the progress of remediative actions.", "The final and unbeatable notion is the level of security technology can provide that paper processes cannot match. Most software systems have the capability to provide audit trail information on changes made to a document. Systems can be configured for an added layer of security by having authentication access or lock-down procedures, and disaster recovery mechanisms such as document back-up and retrieval.", "Given the need for FSFs to contend with the increased volume of data, adequate document management and stringent reporting requirements, paper and manual processes simply cannot keep pace with the increasing complexity of these compliance requirements.

Risk management is viewed by some in the property sector as a hindrance rather than a help in the achievement of business objectives. The AFR headline quoted above clearly demonstrates this. \u00a0However, such views fail to recognise the underlying principles of risk management.", "The AU/NZS ISO 31000 standard defines risk as \u201cthe effect of uncertainty on objectives\u201d. Therefore, by definition, risk management must be \u201cthe management of the effect of uncertainty on objectives\u201d. Objectives are business outcomes. This makes risk management \u201coutcome management\u201d. This simple recognition turns risk management (and the narrower health and safety management focus) from a perceived hindrance to an enabler.

Although this is often the focus of regulatory ", "compliance risk management", " in many property sector organisations, it should not be the sole focus. ", "Risk and Reward are linked. For those that choose to pursue adrenalin sports, one of the key objectives is to feel good from the release of adrenalin and from the feeling of achievement in overcoming fear. This derives from the actual (or perceived) risk in the sport. The greater the risk, the greater the potential for positive feeling (reward).", "We commonly refer to this as the Risk / Reward equation. ", "Performance in business is most often focused solely, or mostly, on the reward side of the equation. This is primarily because the reward side is the main focus of accountants, analysts, senior management, shareholders and the basis of many remuneration schemes. Also, it is easier to measure the rewards side. Performance should however, be relative to the risk the business faces. We refer to this as risk based performance and have the common measures of \u201crisk adjusted return\u201d (RAR), \u201creturn on risk adjusted capital\u201d (RORAC) and \u201crisk adjusted return on capital\u201d (RAROC). ", "This means that everything we do has an expected reward (the expected outcome) and a level of risk (the degree to which there may be variation between the expected outcome and the actual outcome). Performance management should therefore focus on the relationship between expected outcome (Reward) and potential variation in that outcome (Risk). Risk management is therefore one half of performance management. ", "When performed correctly, moving from regulatory compliance management to the ", "broader enterprise risk management", " should:", "The common misunderstanding that risk management means risk minimisation, damages the risk management profession. Risk management is about ensuring we make intelligent risk based decisions that provide an adequate reward for the risk we take. Risk and risk management is therefore an integral part of performance management. An organisation that halves risk for the same reward adds equivalent value to one that doubles reward for the same risk. When an organisation realises this, risk management is immediately recognised as a business enabler, not, as many people currently think, a business hindrance.", "To finish with an example: A number of years ago we carried out a series of risk assessments for a large property company. As part of the final presentation to Board, the Chairman asked the divisional heads what they had got out of the process. Most, as expected, commented that they better understood their risks and had tightened controls in a number of areas. One head, on the other hand, made the comment \u201cMy take-away is to reduce and remove some of our controls!\u201d He was the head of a property development division which was previously a family company acquired by the larger organisation. He had run the family company. He had continued the same level of controls into the new company. What he realised was that the larger company\u2019s risk appetite (their tolerance to risk levels) was much greater than his old family company and as a result, he could loosen controls and start accepting higher risk developments for potentially higher rewards. He did this and built a successful, higher reward business.", "Interested in learning how your organisation can move thinking away from regulatory compliance risk management to performance management?

However, any general rule is there to be challenged. Can residual risk be higher than inherent risk? To assess this, we need to understand the way in which controls modify risk, leading to a residual risk position.\u00a0", "A common definition of controls is \"A specific action taken with the objective of reducing either the likelihood of the risk occurring and / or the consequence if the risk were to occur\".
