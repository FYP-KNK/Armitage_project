The program is continued as long as the child gets benefit and holds the changes (average range between 2 weeks and 6 months, in which time it is hoped that permanent neurological changes will have been made.

It is currently in the descriptive stage of the research. The current theory surrounding this program has been drawn from studies into the effects of massage therapy and exercise. It is postulated that the brushing helps to stimulate the body to release endorphins. These last in the system 90 minutes- 2 hours. If the brushing occurs at the required frequency, then these endorphins are in the bloodstream consistently and stimulate the body to release calming and organising neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. The consistent effects of these neurotransmitters in the bloodstream mean the child becomes more organised and calmer and that sensory defensiveness is reduced or eliminated.", "\n", "Julia and Patricia Wilbarger suggested that in their experience of those who follow the program as suggested (drawn from clear documentation from the thousands of children they have worked with)", "\n", "\u2022 approximatily 40% of children appear to be mostly cured (with relapses in times of stress)", "\n\u2022 approximately 40% make significant improvements", "\n\u2022 20% don\u2019t seem to change much.
