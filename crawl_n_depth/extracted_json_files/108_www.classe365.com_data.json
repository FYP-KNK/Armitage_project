In the classroom, they have discussions, labs, demonstrations, question and answer activities related to the assignment. This approach provides learning flexibility to the students as they are free to learn at their own pace. It motivates the students to practise self-study, and provides plenty of options to explore a topic by themselves.", "Flipping the Classroom", "A flip class is essentially a different model of conducting classes. Students study their lessons at home by watching live or pre-recorded video lectures, online materials and assignments. And in class, they do their homework. In other words, students do all the learning at home, and all the practical work at school. This encourages learning with peers and teachers. In this approach, students involve with lectures outside of class to prepare for an active learning experience in the classroom. In addition, students can learn concepts and widen their knowledge base before coming to class to apply their learning.", "This methodology has enabled teachers to support and guide students with their homework in class.\u00a0Teachers can create a flip class, add a new lecture, add a new section within the lecture and so on.

For instance, they can download the lectures and can pause, rewind or do a search on the internet and so on. Above all, students can control the time and pace with the online materials. After going to the classroom, students can involve in discussion and activities among fellow classmates. This in turn makes learning and education a holistic experience beyond classroom academics.", "In a flip class, the teacher acts as resource provider to the students through technology, and students take the primary stage where they gather knowledge, concepts.
