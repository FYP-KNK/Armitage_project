Let\u2019s first take a look at a critical issue raised by one of the event\u2019s keynote speakers, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop.", "The overarching message presented by Ms Bishop was the \u201crising importance of science, engineering and technology.\u201d This is an ever-pertinent message for Australian educators, and something that became very apparent to her as the Minister for Education and Science in 2006-2007 (Bishop, 2018). Whilst Ms Bishop has held several other significant senior political roles including Shadow Treasurer, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, and most recently the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the mandate for Australia to provide quality science and technology education is still a topic she speaks about passionately. In particular, supporting and developing women; from early school education (Bishop, 2018), right through to inspiring women to be successful in innovation, business, politics and leadership (Bishop, 2019). Let\u2019s take a look at a recent example of Ms Bishop\u2019s experience.", "Whilst still Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ms Bishop presented at the 2018 Vogue Codes event with an emphatic and confronting message. In her opening lines, Ms Bishop stated that \u201cno country can reach its full potential unless and until it embraces and engages with and utilises the skills and talents and intellect and energy of the 50 per cent of its population that is female\u201d (Bishop, 2018). A strong statement indeed, and of course entirely valid. Given the challenges ahead, it seems unlikely that we will meet them without this equality. Quoting statistics referring to the fact that \u201c75% of the fastest growing occupations worldwide require STEM [science, technology, engineering and maths] skills and STEM knowledge\u201d, Ms Bishop went on the state that if we in Australia are to \u201csustain our standard of living, then we need more women and girls who are STEM-literate and undertaking STEM careers\u201d (Bishop, 2018).", "One outstanding example of this message becoming reality is the Commonwealth Digital Identity Initiative. It\u2019s one of several projects pioneered by the innovationXchange, a hub introduced to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by the then Hon. Ms Julie Bishop in 2015. In partnership with the UK and other public and private partners (Innovation Exchange, 2019), it\u2019s a project designed to help people with no formal ID; e.g. birth certificate, driver\u2019s licence, credit cards or similar. It\u2019s hard to believe, but it\u2019s estimated that there may be around 1 billion people affected by this around the world, making access to basic services including health and education either very difficult or impossible (Bishop, 2018). And in fact, \u201cwomen are more likely to lack an ID than men, particularly in low income countries, where over 45% of women do not have an ID compared to 30% of men\u201d (Innovation Exchange, 2019).", "Why is this innovative? It\u2019s a question openly asked on the innovationXchange website. Along with the clear humanitarian benefits, the program answers this question with this very clear statement;", "Digital identity along with internet connectivity and digital financial services are considered to be the building blocks of a modern digital economy. With these core elements in place, it becomes easier for governments, businesses and entrepreneurs to innovate further and to find new ways to engage a connected population. (Innovation Exchange, 2019)", "So, the mandate for raising awareness about science, technology and engineering in our schools is clearly supported by real life examples. It\u2019s not just about increasing student numbers in subjects. There are real human and economic benefits, both locally and globally. Delegates at the conference were indeed privileged to listen to Ms Bishop\u2019s address, which comes from a background of much experience.", "Innovation also lies at the heart of Sentral\u2019s mission: to help schools work smart. Harnessing the power that science, technology and engineering have to offer, Sentral embraces this message through constant development of its product offerings. Perhaps one of the most salient advances of computing technology in the last 15 years has been the development of cloud technology, and Sentral is helping schools understand and take advantage of the benefits it has to offer. For example, consider the key points presented at the conference, by one of Sentral\u2019s dedicated Education Consultants, Cassie Martin.", "As administrative demands on schools grow, IT systems can become more complex and onerous to manage. With Sentral in the cloud, local infrastructure requirements are significantly reduced with a corresponding reduction in IT support. Maintaining ageing and expensive hardware is no longer required, and the management of software updates happens seamlessly in the background whilst your school gets on with business. And, as your school grows, the capacity to expand your data requirements can be added as needed.", "A key issue facing teachers today is managing the increasing responsibilities of their jobs, in addition to actual face to face teaching. And in a world where people are increasingly working at times most efficient for them, it\u2019s critical for schools to have a system that works when their staff do. So, when teachers need access to Sentral, they can rest assured it will be there for them, 99.9% of the time. The high-speed nature of Sentral in the cloud means no risk of outages at critical or peak times.", "Moving from an onsite server to the cloud results in a lower total cost of ownership for most schools. This is made possible by the reduction of capital costs associated with owning and managing computer hardware and infrastructure. This includes simple, and sometimes overlooked running costs such as electricity, air conditioning, security and support associated with server rooms and specialised equipment. In addition, there are no more limits on data.", "Safety and compliance are of paramount importance to your school. They are also a critical part of Sentral\u2019s cloud solution. When schools migrate to Sentral in the cloud, they can rest assured that it complies with all government privacy requirements. Through our partnership with Microsoft, school data is hosted on the acclaimed Microsoft Azure cloud computing service. It offers best in class security and redundancy features, being located in numerous Microsoft-managed data centres. And of course, regular backups and fast restoration of systems are all included.", "There is no doubt that as we meet current challenges, new ones will arise. The exceptional educators at the PPA Conference, Sentral\u2019s presence and the inspiring keynote presentations demonstrate part of the collective commitment to addressing what lies ahead for our children. And it is this commitment that will help Australia continue to \u2018build\u2019 and prosper socially and economically.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "Bishop, J. (2018). Address at Vogue Codes.

It\u2019s something that often gets talked about in the media around this time of year, ", "like this example in the SMH", " which describes strategies being used at Sir Joseph Banks High School in Sydney. Generally, concerns about the transition include stress, coping strategies, the anxiety of suddenly becoming the small fish in the big pond, and the impact on academic achievement. Some students sail through this without any trouble, but many don\u2019t. Sentral can play a significant role in managing some of these concerns, and to find out how, it\u2019s useful to take a look at some recent Australian research on student transition from primary school to high school.", "In a paper by Hopwood, Hay, and Dyment (2016) the authors report on a research study that claims to build upon current knowledge about student transition \u201cby focussing specifically on the perspectives of teachers, as teachers play an important role in guiding and supporting students through the transition years\u201d. This is interesting because it might seem normal to think that the teachers have got it all together, and that it\u2019s the students who are experiencing all the stress. Not so according to the research by Hopwood.", "The small-scale study in the state of Tasmania had the specific \u201cgoal of accessing authentic teacher voice pertaining to their experiences of facilitating the transition process\u201d. It took what researchers call a qualitative interpretivist perspective. It means that the researchers were more interested in depth than large numbers. They really wanted to know the actual experiences of the teachers. Three key themes emerged for transition success,", "(Hopwood et al., 2016)", "Whilst the above three themes seem reasonably straightforward, they are actually quite complex to implement given the large variety of factors at play. When a student transitions, they may be moving to a different school system or different area which means that continuity, communication and support can be that much more difficult amongst teachers. This is where a common student management platform like Sentral can make a significant positive impact. Let\u2019s take a brief look at some examples.", "Sentral improves continuity", "In a recent interview with David Summerville, ICT administrator at Callaghan College, Wallsend Campus in Newcastle, David commented that one of the benefits of using Sentral was that so many teachers were familiar with the platform. This dramatically shortened the onboarding process for new teachers. But what about the transition issue? Again, one of the insights David shared was improved continuity of data once all the feeder schools for Callaghan (also Sentral schools) moved to a cloud-based version of Sentral. This would mean that the entire student history could easily migrate to the high school situation, bringing with it all the academic records, student plans and wellbeing information. For high school teachers awaiting their new year 7 students, this level of information could give teachers valuable advance notice of their students\u2019 capabilities and needs. And it\u2019s not only the data that are of value, but the data will be in a familiar format which reduces time spent sifting through hard copies or digital data from another system.", "Sentral improves communication", "It\u2019s universally accepted that good communication leads to good outcomes. Yet there are still shortfalls in the way we communicate. Consider this finding from the research.", "Despite the acknowledgement that communication was an important part of teacher practice, the majority of teachers interviewed reported that communication was not occurring sufficiently between schools, making it difficult to address the needs of their students adequately.", "(Hopwood et al., 2016)", "But what does the above comment really call for? Does it mean more phone calls, sms, emails or data exchange? Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, findings from the study revealed that \u201cjust over half the teachers reported the need for increased school visits\u201d (Hopwood et al., 2016). Whilst this may be desirable, it may not always be practical. So, what do you do? That depends on your personal preferred method of communication, and the tools you have at your disposal. With a fully integrated system like Sentral there are several benefits. The Sentral Communication module may not be able to magically teleport a teacher to another school, but it can provide teachers at both ends the ability to check message history within the school and between parents and caregivers. It provides a way to appropriately share relevant documents, track issues and interview history. Whilst not being able to substitute a physical meeting or visit to another school, Sentral can provide the all-important backstory for teachers to more adequately know the individual needs of transitioning students.", "Sentral improves support", "Consider this finding from the study.", "Teacher support referred to the types of resources available to assist teachers, including access to age appropriate resources, teacher\u2019s aides to work with students in the classroom, increased planning time, support from colleagues and opportunities to attend professional development days.", "The common theme in the above comment is that each of the resources listed require time. For teachers to do their work efficiently and effectively, quality time can be created by removing the burden of day to day administrative tasks. As a fully integrated system, Sentral allows teachers to manage tasks such as daily admin, assessment, academic reporting, wellbeing and more using a seamless digital solution that works quietly in the background. With more time and less hassle, teachers can reallocate precious time to things like creating resources, planning and professional development.", "Continuity, communication and support are all complex topics and they\u2019ll represent different things in different contexts. That\u2019s one of the reasons why small-scale research studies like the one discussed add so much value; it meant something for those participants. It\u2019s a good reminder for all involved in education to consider ways to bridge the gap between research and practice to achieve better learning outcomes. Staying abreast of this kind of knowledge and insight is also one of the key drivers of Sentral\u2019s mission; to help teachers and students be the best they can be.", "https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/the-school-that-s-making-high-school-more-like-primary-20191127-p53emn.html", "Hopwood, B., Hay, I., & Dyment, J.

This year\u2019s inspiring theme: Building Us. Sentral was there as a key sponsor to the event with several contributions that supported the theme. More on that later in this post. Let\u2019s first take a look at a critical issue raised by one of the event\u2019s keynote speakers, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop.", "The overarching message presented by Ms Bishop was the \u201crising importance of science, engineering and technology.\u201d This is an ever-pertinent message for Australian educators, and something that became very apparent to her as the Minister for Education and Science in 2006-2007 (Bishop, 2018). Whilst Ms Bishop has held several other significant senior political roles including Shadow Treasurer, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, and most recently the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the mandate for Australia to provide quality science and technology education is still a topic she speaks about passionately. In particular, supporting and developing women; from early school education (Bishop, 2018), right through to inspiring women to be successful in innovation, business, politics and leadership (Bishop, 2019). Let\u2019s take a look at a recent example of Ms Bishop\u2019s experience.", "Whilst still Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ms Bishop presented at the 2018 Vogue Codes event with an emphatic and confronting message. In her opening lines, Ms Bishop stated that \u201cno country can reach its full potential unless and until it embraces and engages with and utilises the skills and talents and intellect and energy of the 50 per cent of its population that is female\u201d (Bishop, 2018). A strong statement indeed, and of course entirely valid. Given the challenges ahead, it seems unlikely that we will meet them without this equality. Quoting statistics referring to the fact that \u201c75% of the fastest growing occupations worldwide require STEM [science, technology, engineering and maths] skills and STEM knowledge\u201d, Ms Bishop went on the state that if we in Australia are to \u201csustain our standard of living, then we need more women and girls who are STEM-literate and undertaking STEM careers\u201d (Bishop, 2018).", "One outstanding example of this message becoming reality is the Commonwealth Digital Identity Initiative. It\u2019s one of several projects pioneered by the innovationXchange, a hub introduced to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by the then Hon. Ms Julie Bishop in 2015. In partnership with the UK and other public and private partners (Innovation Exchange, 2019), it\u2019s a project designed to help people with no formal ID; e.g. birth certificate, driver\u2019s licence, credit cards or similar. It\u2019s hard to believe, but it\u2019s estimated that there may be around 1 billion people affected by this around the world, making access to basic services including health and education either very difficult or impossible (Bishop, 2018). And in fact, \u201cwomen are more likely to lack an ID than men, particularly in low income countries, where over 45% of women do not have an ID compared to 30% of men\u201d (Innovation Exchange, 2019).", "Why is this innovative? It\u2019s a question openly asked on the innovationXchange website. Along with the clear humanitarian benefits, the program answers this question with this very clear statement;", "Digital identity along with internet connectivity and digital financial services are considered to be the building blocks of a modern digital economy. With these core elements in place, it becomes easier for governments, businesses and entrepreneurs to innovate further and to find new ways to engage a connected population. (Innovation Exchange, 2019)", "So, the mandate for raising awareness about science, technology and engineering in our schools is clearly supported by real life examples. It\u2019s not just about increasing student numbers in subjects. There are real human and economic benefits, both locally and globally. Delegates at the conference were indeed privileged to listen to Ms Bishop\u2019s address, which comes from a background of much experience.", "Innovation also lies at the heart of Sentral\u2019s mission: to help schools work smart. Harnessing the power that science, technology and engineering have to offer, Sentral embraces this message through constant development of its product offerings. Perhaps one of the most salient advances of computing technology in the last 15 years has been the development of cloud technology, and Sentral is helping schools understand and take advantage of the benefits it has to offer. For example, consider the key points presented at the conference, by one of Sentral\u2019s dedicated Education Consultants, Cassie Martin.", "As administrative demands on schools grow, IT systems can become more complex and onerous to manage. With Sentral in the cloud, local infrastructure requirements are significantly reduced with a corresponding reduction in IT support. Maintaining ageing and expensive hardware is no longer required, and the management of software updates happens seamlessly in the background whilst your school gets on with business. And, as your school grows, the capacity to expand your data requirements can be added as needed.", "A key issue facing teachers today is managing the increasing responsibilities of their jobs, in addition to actual face to face teaching. And in a world where people are increasingly working at times most efficient for them, it\u2019s critical for schools to have a system that works when their staff do. So, when teachers need access to Sentral, they can rest assured it will be there for them, 99.9% of the time. The high-speed nature of Sentral in the cloud means no risk of outages at critical or peak times.", "Moving from an onsite server to the cloud results in a lower total cost of ownership for most schools. This is made possible by the reduction of capital costs associated with owning and managing computer hardware and infrastructure. This includes simple, and sometimes overlooked running costs such as electricity, air conditioning, security and support associated with server rooms and specialised equipment. In addition, there are no more limits on data.", "Safety and compliance are of paramount importance to your school. They are also a critical part of Sentral\u2019s cloud solution.

As a technology educator, this was akin to a child visiting the best toyshop in the world, since Festool makes some of the finest power tools available, and I was using them in my daily work. Given my German heritage, and fluency in the language I knew I could approach this with confidence. I stretched out my hand and greeted the energetic process engineer, and in my excitement, realised that I had just committed my first faux pas. I used a casual greeting. How could I make such a beginner\u2019s mistake? Traditionally, this would be a social disaster, particularly in a corporate context. Yet my young (and progressive) host recognised what was going on, smiled and graciously welcomed me in. I hadn\u2019t even made it through the door, and culture was already playing a significant role.", "Fast forward to the present, and the experience still resonates, particularly given that technology education, and more specifically STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) is yet to demonstrate a significant uptake in student interest (Education Council, 2018). Why aren\u2019t more students passionate about STEM learning pathways in senior school years? Perhaps it is because there are many definitions for what STEM actually is, which results in lack of consensus of what the \u2018subject\u2019 looks like (Holmlund, Lesseig, & Slavit, 2018). This undoubtedly forms the first hurdle, because it\u2019s hard to implement a learning area with so much ambiguity. At the same time, Australian education bodies note that the number of students studying foreign languages is also in decline (ACOLA, 2013). Is this a curious coincidence, or an opportunity for investigation, or both?", "Consider the plausibility that there is a connection between declining interest in STEM and foreign language learning in schools. Not because they are seemingly unrelated. But because there are overlapping elements of \u2018culture\u2019 which are easily overlooked or forgotten, as I was quick to experience in my visit to Festool. Referring again to definitions, it is noteworthy that many describe STEM in much broader terms than its component subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Definitions include an \u201centerprise that operates with a social license\u201d, which is \u201ctruly global\u201d and \u201cbridges cultural divide\u201d (Office of the Chief Scientist, 2013). STEM \u201ccontributes to personal, social, and economic outcomes\u201d (Timms, Moyle, Weldon, & Mitchell, 2018). STEM outcomes are \u201ccultural achievements that reflect people\u2019s humanity\u201d (National Research Council, 2011), and \u201cbroaden student understanding of STEM disciplines through exposure to culturally relevant STEM contexts\u201d (Moore, 2008). Comparing these definitions with the rationale for languages as stated in the Australian Curriculum (AC) makes for interesting reading, where \u201clanguage capabilities represent linguistic and cultural resources through which the community can engage socially, culturally and economically, in domains which include business, trade, science\u2026health and communications\u201d (ACARA, 2018). And notably the rationale from the International Baccalaureate (IB) which aims to \u201cenable students to understand and use the language they have studied in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes\u201d (International Baccalaureate, 2014). There is certainly an overlap. Ironically, the introduction of computers into schools was meant to be part of the solution. Who can forget the bold claims of a \u2018digital education revolution\u2019 made by Kevin Rudd in the 2007 labour election campaign? The benefit to trade and technical students, to the study of sciences and chemistry, and the turbo charging of foreign language learning that computers would facilitate was certainly a vision. But the results have been lacklustre. Despite the above, thousands of teachers have tried to move the needle on this issue and are doing great work. But perhaps the complication of culture is just too difficult to overcome. We need innovation, but what kind?", "Clayton Christensen is known the world over for his ground breaking work on ", "disruptive innovation", " (Christensen, 2000). He distinguishes disruptive technologies from what he calls sustaining technologies, in that sustaining technologies \u201cimprove the performance of established products, along the dimensions of performance that mainstream customers in major markets have historically valued. Most technological advances in a given industry are sustaining in character\u201d. In other words, we like it when the products and services we buy continue to get incrementally better. According to Christensen, managers generally allocate resources to such innovations because it makes sense to do so. Seems obvious, right? By contrast, disruptive technologies \u201cbring to market a very different value proposition that had been available previously. Generally, disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally new) customers value\u201d (Christensen, 2000). Historically, managers have been hesitant to allocate resources to disruptive innovations because it doesn\u2019t make sense to do so. Schools can learn from this dichotomy. What if the STEM and language declines could be turned by an unknown or nonsensical value proposition? Not that we ignored it. It\u2019s just that making classes work in unusual combinations is difficult, especially when students are mostly choosing other subjects. It doesn\u2019t make sense to allocate resources that way. Although doing so, may be precisely what Australia needs if it is to address the aforementioned declines. This is a dilemma.", "The Alternative Value Proposition", "Consider the opening story. It\u2019s easy to consider wider factors when you\u2019ve suddenly found yourself red-faced in a culturally awkward situation and everything becomes crystal clear. But it\u2019s a tough sell to students and school administrators when the resource allocation doesn\u2019t make sense and the benefits only become apparent years later; potentially in another country, contributing to another country\u2019s economy. But could the complementary cultural themes across learning areas drive an awareness of unknown value propositions? Could a disruptive approach to designing learning pathways and resource allocation indeed contribute to reversing the STEM and languages declines? Maybe. But it will take vision, and risk taking to find out.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "References:", "ACARA. (2018). Rationale.

It\u2019s something that often gets talked about in the media around this time of year, ", "like this example in the SMH", " which describes strategies being used at Sir Joseph Banks High School in Sydney. Generally, concerns about the transition include stress, coping strategies, the anxiety of suddenly becoming the small fish in the big pond, and the impact on academic achievement. Some students sail through this without any trouble, but many don\u2019t. Sentral can play a significant role in managing some of these concerns, and to find out how, it\u2019s useful to take a look at some recent Australian research on student transition from primary school to high school.", "In a paper by Hopwood, Hay, and Dyment (2016) the authors report on a research study that claims to build upon current knowledge about student transition \u201cby focussing specifically on the perspectives of teachers, as teachers play an important role in guiding and supporting students through the transition years\u201d. This is interesting because it might seem normal to think that the teachers have got it all together, and that it\u2019s the students who are experiencing all the stress. Not so according to the research by Hopwood.", "The small-scale study in the state of Tasmania had the specific \u201cgoal of accessing authentic teacher voice pertaining to their experiences of facilitating the transition process\u201d. It took what researchers call a qualitative interpretivist perspective. It means that the researchers were more interested in depth than large numbers. They really wanted to know the actual experiences of the teachers. Three key themes emerged for transition success,", "(Hopwood et al., 2016)", "Whilst the above three themes seem reasonably straightforward, they are actually quite complex to implement given the large variety of factors at play. When a student transitions, they may be moving to a different school system or different area which means that continuity, communication and support can be that much more difficult amongst teachers. This is where a common student management platform like Sentral can make a significant positive impact. Let\u2019s take a brief look at some examples.", "Sentral improves continuity", "In a recent interview with David Summerville, ICT administrator at Callaghan College, Wallsend Campus in Newcastle, David commented that one of the benefits of using Sentral was that so many teachers were familiar with the platform. This dramatically shortened the onboarding process for new teachers. But what about the transition issue? Again, one of the insights David shared was improved continuity of data once all the feeder schools for Callaghan (also Sentral schools) moved to a cloud-based version of Sentral. This would mean that the entire student history could easily migrate to the high school situation, bringing with it all the academic records, student plans and wellbeing information. For high school teachers awaiting their new year 7 students, this level of information could give teachers valuable advance notice of their students\u2019 capabilities and needs. And it\u2019s not only the data that are of value, but the data will be in a familiar format which reduces time spent sifting through hard copies or digital data from another system.", "Sentral improves communication", "It\u2019s universally accepted that good communication leads to good outcomes. Yet there are still shortfalls in the way we communicate. Consider this finding from the research.", "Despite the acknowledgement that communication was an important part of teacher practice, the majority of teachers interviewed reported that communication was not occurring sufficiently between schools, making it difficult to address the needs of their students adequately.", "(Hopwood et al., 2016)", "But what does the above comment really call for? Does it mean more phone calls, sms, emails or data exchange? Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, findings from the study revealed that \u201cjust over half the teachers reported the need for increased school visits\u201d (Hopwood et al., 2016). Whilst this may be desirable, it may not always be practical. So, what do you do? That depends on your personal preferred method of communication, and the tools you have at your disposal. With a fully integrated system like Sentral there are several benefits. The Sentral Communication module may not be able to magically teleport a teacher to another school, but it can provide teachers at both ends the ability to check message history within the school and between parents and caregivers. It provides a way to appropriately share relevant documents, track issues and interview history. Whilst not being able to substitute a physical meeting or visit to another school, Sentral can provide the all-important backstory for teachers to more adequately know the individual needs of transitioning students.", "Sentral improves support", "Consider this finding from the study.", "Teacher support referred to the types of resources available to assist teachers, including access to age appropriate resources, teacher\u2019s aides to work with students in the classroom, increased planning time, support from colleagues and opportunities to attend professional development days.", "The common theme in the above comment is that each of the resources listed require time. For teachers to do their work efficiently and effectively, quality time can be created by removing the burden of day to day administrative tasks. As a fully integrated system, Sentral allows teachers to manage tasks such as daily admin, assessment, academic reporting, wellbeing and more using a seamless digital solution that works quietly in the background. With more time and less hassle, teachers can reallocate precious time to things like creating resources, planning and professional development.", "Continuity, communication and support are all complex topics and they\u2019ll represent different things in different contexts. That\u2019s one of the reasons why small-scale research studies like the one discussed add so much value; it meant something for those participants. It\u2019s a good reminder for all involved in education to consider ways to bridge the gap between research and practice to achieve better learning outcomes. Staying abreast of this kind of knowledge and insight is also one of the key drivers of Sentral\u2019s mission; to help teachers and students be the best they can be.", "https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/the-school-that-s-making-high-school-more-like-primary-20191127-p53emn.html", "Hopwood, B., Hay, I., & Dyment, J.

As a technology educator, this was akin to a child visiting the best toyshop in the world, since Festool makes some of the finest power tools available, and I was using them in my daily work. Given my German heritage, and fluency in the language I knew I could approach this with confidence. I stretched out my hand and greeted the energetic process engineer, and in my excitement, realised that I had just committed my first faux pas. I used a casual greeting. How could I make such a beginner\u2019s mistake? Traditionally, this would be a social disaster, particularly in a corporate context. Yet my young (and progressive) host recognised what was going on, smiled and graciously welcomed me in. I hadn\u2019t even made it through the door, and culture was already playing a significant role.", "Fast forward to the present, and the experience still resonates, particularly given that technology education, and more specifically STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) is yet to demonstrate a significant uptake in student interest (Education Council, 2018). Why aren\u2019t more students passionate about STEM learning pathways in senior school years? Perhaps it is because there are many definitions for what STEM actually is, which results in lack of consensus of what the \u2018subject\u2019 looks like (Holmlund, Lesseig, & Slavit, 2018). This undoubtedly forms the first hurdle, because it\u2019s hard to implement a learning area with so much ambiguity. At the same time, Australian education bodies note that the number of students studying foreign languages is also in decline (ACOLA, 2013). Is this a curious coincidence, or an opportunity for investigation, or both?", "Consider the plausibility that there is a connection between declining interest in STEM and foreign language learning in schools. Not because they are seemingly unrelated. But because there are overlapping elements of \u2018culture\u2019 which are easily overlooked or forgotten, as I was quick to experience in my visit to Festool. Referring again to definitions, it is noteworthy that many describe STEM in much broader terms than its component subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Definitions include an \u201centerprise that operates with a social license\u201d, which is \u201ctruly global\u201d and \u201cbridges cultural divide\u201d (Office of the Chief Scientist, 2013). STEM \u201ccontributes to personal, social, and economic outcomes\u201d (Timms, Moyle, Weldon, & Mitchell, 2018). STEM outcomes are \u201ccultural achievements that reflect people\u2019s humanity\u201d (National Research Council, 2011), and \u201cbroaden student understanding of STEM disciplines through exposure to culturally relevant STEM contexts\u201d (Moore, 2008). Comparing these definitions with the rationale for languages as stated in the Australian Curriculum (AC) makes for interesting reading, where \u201clanguage capabilities represent linguistic and cultural resources through which the community can engage socially, culturally and economically, in domains which include business, trade, science\u2026health and communications\u201d (ACARA, 2018). And notably the rationale from the International Baccalaureate (IB) which aims to \u201cenable students to understand and use the language they have studied in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes\u201d (International Baccalaureate, 2014). There is certainly an overlap. Ironically, the introduction of computers into schools was meant to be part of the solution. Who can forget the bold claims of a \u2018digital education revolution\u2019 made by Kevin Rudd in the 2007 labour election campaign? The benefit to trade and technical students, to the study of sciences and chemistry, and the turbo charging of foreign language learning that computers would facilitate was certainly a vision. But the results have been lacklustre. Despite the above, thousands of teachers have tried to move the needle on this issue and are doing great work. But perhaps the complication of culture is just too difficult to overcome. We need innovation, but what kind?", "Clayton Christensen is known the world over for his ground breaking work on ", "disruptive innovation", " (Christensen, 2000). He distinguishes disruptive technologies from what he calls sustaining technologies, in that sustaining technologies \u201cimprove the performance of established products, along the dimensions of performance that mainstream customers in major markets have historically valued. Most technological advances in a given industry are sustaining in character\u201d. In other words, we like it when the products and services we buy continue to get incrementally better. According to Christensen, managers generally allocate resources to such innovations because it makes sense to do so. Seems obvious, right? By contrast, disruptive technologies \u201cbring to market a very different value proposition that had been available previously. Generally, disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally new) customers value\u201d (Christensen, 2000). Historically, managers have been hesitant to allocate resources to disruptive innovations because it doesn\u2019t make sense to do so. Schools can learn from this dichotomy. What if the STEM and language declines could be turned by an unknown or nonsensical value proposition? Not that we ignored it. It\u2019s just that making classes work in unusual combinations is difficult, especially when students are mostly choosing other subjects. It doesn\u2019t make sense to allocate resources that way. Although doing so, may be precisely what Australia needs if it is to address the aforementioned declines. This is a dilemma.", "The Alternative Value Proposition", "Consider the opening story. It\u2019s easy to consider wider factors when you\u2019ve suddenly found yourself red-faced in a culturally awkward situation and everything becomes crystal clear. But it\u2019s a tough sell to students and school administrators when the resource allocation doesn\u2019t make sense and the benefits only become apparent years later; potentially in another country, contributing to another country\u2019s economy. But could the complementary cultural themes across learning areas drive an awareness of unknown value propositions? Could a disruptive approach to designing learning pathways and resource allocation indeed contribute to reversing the STEM and languages declines? Maybe. But it will take vision, and risk taking to find out.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "References:", "ACARA. (2018). Rationale.

Take for example findings from the TALIS 2018 survey, conducted by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER). What\u2019s that?", "\u201cThe OECD Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) collects internationally comparable data on the learning environment and the working conditions of teachers and principals in schools across the world.

Principals of schools with a higher proportion of socioeconomically disadvantaged students were more likely to report a lack of principal support such as higher levels of teacher absenteeism, lack of support from parents or guardians, and lack of shared leadership within the school.

Surely leadership is done by the people and not the software. Yes, that\u2019s absolutely correct. For example, in a recent podcast interview with Kylie Fabri, Deputy Principal at Callaghan College Wallsend Campus in Newcastle (a Sentral school), Kylie made very clear that it was the people who ultimately made the difference, but that achieving the outcomes was made that much simpler and effective with the right tools at hand. And that\u2019s why Sentral plays such a vital role at Callaghan.", "Consider these findings from TALIS 2018.", "A little more than one-third (34%) of Australian principals\u2019 working time was spent on administrative tasks and meetings, while one-quarter (25%) of their time was spent on leadership tasks and meetings. Prior OECD research identified curriculum and teaching-related tasks and meetings as a key component of instructional leadership and supporting teaching.

That\u2019s a fairly substantial proportion. Now imagine if that time could be reduced, or at least made more efficient.

Also of concern is the relatively high incidence of intimidation or verbal abuse of teachers or staff. Twelve per cent of Australian principals reported that this happens at least weekly, compared to three per cent on average across the OECD. The incidence of cyber-bullying, measured for the first time, was also relatively high compared to the average across the OECD.

We can help ease your digital transformation journey.", "Written and produced by Colin Klupiec", "The Dilemma", "In late 2014 I had the great privilege of visiting a Festool advanced manufacturing facility in the middle of Germany, not far from the city of Stuttgart. As a technology educator, this was akin to a child visiting the best toyshop in the world, since Festool makes some of the finest power tools available, and I was using them in my daily work. Given my German heritage, and fluency in the language I knew I could approach this with confidence. I stretched out my hand and greeted the energetic process engineer, and in my excitement, realised that I had just committed my first faux pas. I used a casual greeting. How could I make such a beginner\u2019s mistake? Traditionally, this would be a social disaster, particularly in a corporate context. Yet my young (and progressive) host recognised what was going on, smiled and graciously welcomed me in. I hadn\u2019t even made it through the door, and culture was already playing a significant role.", "Fast forward to the present, and the experience still resonates, particularly given that technology education, and more specifically STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) is yet to demonstrate a significant uptake in student interest (Education Council, 2018). Why aren\u2019t more students passionate about STEM learning pathways in senior school years? Perhaps it is because there are many definitions for what STEM actually is, which results in lack of consensus of what the \u2018subject\u2019 looks like (Holmlund, Lesseig, & Slavit, 2018). This undoubtedly forms the first hurdle, because it\u2019s hard to implement a learning area with so much ambiguity. At the same time, Australian education bodies note that the number of students studying foreign languages is also in decline (ACOLA, 2013). Is this a curious coincidence, or an opportunity for investigation, or both?", "Consider the plausibility that there is a connection between declining interest in STEM and foreign language learning in schools. Not because they are seemingly unrelated. But because there are overlapping elements of \u2018culture\u2019 which are easily overlooked or forgotten, as I was quick to experience in my visit to Festool. Referring again to definitions, it is noteworthy that many describe STEM in much broader terms than its component subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Definitions include an \u201centerprise that operates with a social license\u201d, which is \u201ctruly global\u201d and \u201cbridges cultural divide\u201d (Office of the Chief Scientist, 2013). STEM \u201ccontributes to personal, social, and economic outcomes\u201d (Timms, Moyle, Weldon, & Mitchell, 2018). STEM outcomes are \u201ccultural achievements that reflect people\u2019s humanity\u201d (National Research Council, 2011), and \u201cbroaden student understanding of STEM disciplines through exposure to culturally relevant STEM contexts\u201d (Moore, 2008). Comparing these definitions with the rationale for languages as stated in the Australian Curriculum (AC) makes for interesting reading, where \u201clanguage capabilities represent linguistic and cultural resources through which the community can engage socially, culturally and economically, in domains which include business, trade, science\u2026health and communications\u201d (ACARA, 2018). And notably the rationale from the International Baccalaureate (IB) which aims to \u201cenable students to understand and use the language they have studied in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes\u201d (International Baccalaureate, 2014). There is certainly an overlap. Ironically, the introduction of computers into schools was meant to be part of the solution. Who can forget the bold claims of a \u2018digital education revolution\u2019 made by Kevin Rudd in the 2007 labour election campaign? The benefit to trade and technical students, to the study of sciences and chemistry, and the turbo charging of foreign language learning that computers would facilitate was certainly a vision. But the results have been lacklustre. Despite the above, thousands of teachers have tried to move the needle on this issue and are doing great work. But perhaps the complication of culture is just too difficult to overcome. We need innovation, but what kind?", "Clayton Christensen is known the world over for his ground breaking work on ", "disruptive innovation", " (Christensen, 2000). He distinguishes disruptive technologies from what he calls sustaining technologies, in that sustaining technologies \u201cimprove the performance of established products, along the dimensions of performance that mainstream customers in major markets have historically valued. Most technological advances in a given industry are sustaining in character\u201d. In other words, we like it when the products and services we buy continue to get incrementally better. According to Christensen, managers generally allocate resources to such innovations because it makes sense to do so. Seems obvious, right? By contrast, disruptive technologies \u201cbring to market a very different value proposition that had been available previously. Generally, disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally new) customers value\u201d (Christensen, 2000). Historically, managers have been hesitant to allocate resources to disruptive innovations because it doesn\u2019t make sense to do so. Schools can learn from this dichotomy. What if the STEM and language declines could be turned by an unknown or nonsensical value proposition? Not that we ignored it. It\u2019s just that making classes work in unusual combinations is difficult, especially when students are mostly choosing other subjects. It doesn\u2019t make sense to allocate resources that way. Although doing so, may be precisely what Australia needs if it is to address the aforementioned declines. This is a dilemma.", "The Alternative Value Proposition", "Consider the opening story. It\u2019s easy to consider wider factors when you\u2019ve suddenly found yourself red-faced in a culturally awkward situation and everything becomes crystal clear. But it\u2019s a tough sell to students and school administrators when the resource allocation doesn\u2019t make sense and the benefits only become apparent years later; potentially in another country, contributing to another country\u2019s economy. But could the complementary cultural themes across learning areas drive an awareness of unknown value propositions? Could a disruptive approach to designing learning pathways and resource allocation indeed contribute to reversing the STEM and languages declines? Maybe. But it will take vision, and risk taking to find out.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "References:", "ACARA. (2018). Rationale.

Let\u2019s first take a look at a critical issue raised by one of the event\u2019s keynote speakers, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop.", "The overarching message presented by Ms Bishop was the \u201crising importance of science, engineering and technology.\u201d This is an ever-pertinent message for Australian educators, and something that became very apparent to her as the Minister for Education and Science in 2006-2007 (Bishop, 2018). Whilst Ms Bishop has held several other significant senior political roles including Shadow Treasurer, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, and most recently the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the mandate for Australia to provide quality science and technology education is still a topic she speaks about passionately. In particular, supporting and developing women; from early school education (Bishop, 2018), right through to inspiring women to be successful in innovation, business, politics and leadership (Bishop, 2019). Let\u2019s take a look at a recent example of Ms Bishop\u2019s experience.", "Whilst still Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ms Bishop presented at the 2018 Vogue Codes event with an emphatic and confronting message. In her opening lines, Ms Bishop stated that \u201cno country can reach its full potential unless and until it embraces and engages with and utilises the skills and talents and intellect and energy of the 50 per cent of its population that is female\u201d (Bishop, 2018). A strong statement indeed, and of course entirely valid. Given the challenges ahead, it seems unlikely that we will meet them without this equality. Quoting statistics referring to the fact that \u201c75% of the fastest growing occupations worldwide require STEM [science, technology, engineering and maths] skills and STEM knowledge\u201d, Ms Bishop went on the state that if we in Australia are to \u201csustain our standard of living, then we need more women and girls who are STEM-literate and undertaking STEM careers\u201d (Bishop, 2018).", "One outstanding example of this message becoming reality is the Commonwealth Digital Identity Initiative. It\u2019s one of several projects pioneered by the innovationXchange, a hub introduced to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by the then Hon. Ms Julie Bishop in 2015. In partnership with the UK and other public and private partners (Innovation Exchange, 2019), it\u2019s a project designed to help people with no formal ID; e.g. birth certificate, driver\u2019s licence, credit cards or similar. It\u2019s hard to believe, but it\u2019s estimated that there may be around 1 billion people affected by this around the world, making access to basic services including health and education either very difficult or impossible (Bishop, 2018). And in fact, \u201cwomen are more likely to lack an ID than men, particularly in low income countries, where over 45% of women do not have an ID compared to 30% of men\u201d (Innovation Exchange, 2019).", "Why is this innovative? It\u2019s a question openly asked on the innovationXchange website. Along with the clear humanitarian benefits, the program answers this question with this very clear statement;", "Digital identity along with internet connectivity and digital financial services are considered to be the building blocks of a modern digital economy. With these core elements in place, it becomes easier for governments, businesses and entrepreneurs to innovate further and to find new ways to engage a connected population. (Innovation Exchange, 2019)", "So, the mandate for raising awareness about science, technology and engineering in our schools is clearly supported by real life examples. It\u2019s not just about increasing student numbers in subjects. There are real human and economic benefits, both locally and globally. Delegates at the conference were indeed privileged to listen to Ms Bishop\u2019s address, which comes from a background of much experience.", "Innovation also lies at the heart of Sentral\u2019s mission: to help schools work smart. Harnessing the power that science, technology and engineering have to offer, Sentral embraces this message through constant development of its product offerings. Perhaps one of the most salient advances of computing technology in the last 15 years has been the development of cloud technology, and Sentral is helping schools understand and take advantage of the benefits it has to offer. For example, consider the key points presented at the conference, by one of Sentral\u2019s dedicated Education Consultants, Cassie Martin.", "As administrative demands on schools grow, IT systems can become more complex and onerous to manage. With Sentral in the cloud, local infrastructure requirements are significantly reduced with a corresponding reduction in IT support. Maintaining ageing and expensive hardware is no longer required, and the management of software updates happens seamlessly in the background whilst your school gets on with business. And, as your school grows, the capacity to expand your data requirements can be added as needed.", "A key issue facing teachers today is managing the increasing responsibilities of their jobs, in addition to actual face to face teaching. And in a world where people are increasingly working at times most efficient for them, it\u2019s critical for schools to have a system that works when their staff do. So, when teachers need access to Sentral, they can rest assured it will be there for them, 99.9% of the time. The high-speed nature of Sentral in the cloud means no risk of outages at critical or peak times.", "Moving from an onsite server to the cloud results in a lower total cost of ownership for most schools. This is made possible by the reduction of capital costs associated with owning and managing computer hardware and infrastructure. This includes simple, and sometimes overlooked running costs such as electricity, air conditioning, security and support associated with server rooms and specialised equipment. In addition, there are no more limits on data.", "Safety and compliance are of paramount importance to your school. They are also a critical part of Sentral\u2019s cloud solution.

It\u2019s something that often gets talked about in the media around this time of year, ", "like this example in the SMH", " which describes strategies being used at Sir Joseph Banks High School in Sydney. Generally, concerns about the transition include stress, coping strategies, the anxiety of suddenly becoming the small fish in the big pond, and the impact on academic achievement. Some students sail through this without any trouble, but many don\u2019t. Sentral can play a significant role in managing some of these concerns, and to find out how, it\u2019s useful to take a look at some recent Australian research on student transition from primary school to high school.", "In a paper by Hopwood, Hay, and Dyment (2016) the authors report on a research study that claims to build upon current knowledge about student transition \u201cby focussing specifically on the perspectives of teachers, as teachers play an important role in guiding and supporting students through the transition years\u201d. This is interesting because it might seem normal to think that the teachers have got it all together, and that it\u2019s the students who are experiencing all the stress. Not so according to the research by Hopwood.", "The small-scale study in the state of Tasmania had the specific \u201cgoal of accessing authentic teacher voice pertaining to their experiences of facilitating the transition process\u201d. It took what researchers call a qualitative interpretivist perspective. It means that the researchers were more interested in depth than large numbers. They really wanted to know the actual experiences of the teachers. Three key themes emerged for transition success,", "(Hopwood et al., 2016)", "Whilst the above three themes seem reasonably straightforward, they are actually quite complex to implement given the large variety of factors at play. When a student transitions, they may be moving to a different school system or different area which means that continuity, communication and support can be that much more difficult amongst teachers. This is where a common student management platform like Sentral can make a significant positive impact. Let\u2019s take a brief look at some examples.", "Sentral improves continuity", "In a recent interview with David Summerville, ICT administrator at Callaghan College, Wallsend Campus in Newcastle, David commented that one of the benefits of using Sentral was that so many teachers were familiar with the platform. This dramatically shortened the onboarding process for new teachers. But what about the transition issue? Again, one of the insights David shared was improved continuity of data once all the feeder schools for Callaghan (also Sentral schools) moved to a cloud-based version of Sentral. This would mean that the entire student history could easily migrate to the high school situation, bringing with it all the academic records, student plans and wellbeing information. For high school teachers awaiting their new year 7 students, this level of information could give teachers valuable advance notice of their students\u2019 capabilities and needs. And it\u2019s not only the data that are of value, but the data will be in a familiar format which reduces time spent sifting through hard copies or digital data from another system.", "Sentral improves communication", "It\u2019s universally accepted that good communication leads to good outcomes. Yet there are still shortfalls in the way we communicate. Consider this finding from the research.", "Despite the acknowledgement that communication was an important part of teacher practice, the majority of teachers interviewed reported that communication was not occurring sufficiently between schools, making it difficult to address the needs of their students adequately.", "(Hopwood et al., 2016)", "But what does the above comment really call for? Does it mean more phone calls, sms, emails or data exchange? Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, findings from the study revealed that \u201cjust over half the teachers reported the need for increased school visits\u201d (Hopwood et al., 2016). Whilst this may be desirable, it may not always be practical. So, what do you do? That depends on your personal preferred method of communication, and the tools you have at your disposal. With a fully integrated system like Sentral there are several benefits. The Sentral Communication module may not be able to magically teleport a teacher to another school, but it can provide teachers at both ends the ability to check message history within the school and between parents and caregivers. It provides a way to appropriately share relevant documents, track issues and interview history. Whilst not being able to substitute a physical meeting or visit to another school, Sentral can provide the all-important backstory for teachers to more adequately know the individual needs of transitioning students.", "Sentral improves support", "Consider this finding from the study.", "Teacher support referred to the types of resources available to assist teachers, including access to age appropriate resources, teacher\u2019s aides to work with students in the classroom, increased planning time, support from colleagues and opportunities to attend professional development days.", "The common theme in the above comment is that each of the resources listed require time. For teachers to do their work efficiently and effectively, quality time can be created by removing the burden of day to day administrative tasks. As a fully integrated system, Sentral allows teachers to manage tasks such as daily admin, assessment, academic reporting, wellbeing and more using a seamless digital solution that works quietly in the background. With more time and less hassle, teachers can reallocate precious time to things like creating resources, planning and professional development.", "Continuity, communication and support are all complex topics and they\u2019ll represent different things in different contexts. That\u2019s one of the reasons why small-scale research studies like the one discussed add so much value; it meant something for those participants. It\u2019s a good reminder for all involved in education to consider ways to bridge the gap between research and practice to achieve better learning outcomes.

As a technology educator, this was akin to a child visiting the best toyshop in the world, since Festool makes some of the finest power tools available, and I was using them in my daily work. Given my German heritage, and fluency in the language I knew I could approach this with confidence. I stretched out my hand and greeted the energetic process engineer, and in my excitement, realised that I had just committed my first faux pas. I used a casual greeting. How could I make such a beginner\u2019s mistake? Traditionally, this would be a social disaster, particularly in a corporate context. Yet my young (and progressive) host recognised what was going on, smiled and graciously welcomed me in. I hadn\u2019t even made it through the door, and culture was already playing a significant role.", "Fast forward to the present, and the experience still resonates, particularly given that technology education, and more specifically STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) is yet to demonstrate a significant uptake in student interest (Education Council, 2018). Why aren\u2019t more students passionate about STEM learning pathways in senior school years? Perhaps it is because there are many definitions for what STEM actually is, which results in lack of consensus of what the \u2018subject\u2019 looks like (Holmlund, Lesseig, & Slavit, 2018). This undoubtedly forms the first hurdle, because it\u2019s hard to implement a learning area with so much ambiguity. At the same time, Australian education bodies note that the number of students studying foreign languages is also in decline (ACOLA, 2013). Is this a curious coincidence, or an opportunity for investigation, or both?", "Consider the plausibility that there is a connection between declining interest in STEM and foreign language learning in schools. Not because they are seemingly unrelated. But because there are overlapping elements of \u2018culture\u2019 which are easily overlooked or forgotten, as I was quick to experience in my visit to Festool. Referring again to definitions, it is noteworthy that many describe STEM in much broader terms than its component subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Definitions include an \u201centerprise that operates with a social license\u201d, which is \u201ctruly global\u201d and \u201cbridges cultural divide\u201d (Office of the Chief Scientist, 2013). STEM \u201ccontributes to personal, social, and economic outcomes\u201d (Timms, Moyle, Weldon, & Mitchell, 2018). STEM outcomes are \u201ccultural achievements that reflect people\u2019s humanity\u201d (National Research Council, 2011), and \u201cbroaden student understanding of STEM disciplines through exposure to culturally relevant STEM contexts\u201d (Moore, 2008). Comparing these definitions with the rationale for languages as stated in the Australian Curriculum (AC) makes for interesting reading, where \u201clanguage capabilities represent linguistic and cultural resources through which the community can engage socially, culturally and economically, in domains which include business, trade, science\u2026health and communications\u201d (ACARA, 2018). And notably the rationale from the International Baccalaureate (IB) which aims to \u201cenable students to understand and use the language they have studied in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes\u201d (International Baccalaureate, 2014). There is certainly an overlap. Ironically, the introduction of computers into schools was meant to be part of the solution. Who can forget the bold claims of a \u2018digital education revolution\u2019 made by Kevin Rudd in the 2007 labour election campaign? The benefit to trade and technical students, to the study of sciences and chemistry, and the turbo charging of foreign language learning that computers would facilitate was certainly a vision. But the results have been lacklustre. Despite the above, thousands of teachers have tried to move the needle on this issue and are doing great work. But perhaps the complication of culture is just too difficult to overcome. We need innovation, but what kind?", "Clayton Christensen is known the world over for his ground breaking work on ", "disruptive innovation", " (Christensen, 2000). He distinguishes disruptive technologies from what he calls sustaining technologies, in that sustaining technologies \u201cimprove the performance of established products, along the dimensions of performance that mainstream customers in major markets have historically valued. Most technological advances in a given industry are sustaining in character\u201d. In other words, we like it when the products and services we buy continue to get incrementally better. According to Christensen, managers generally allocate resources to such innovations because it makes sense to do so. Seems obvious, right? By contrast, disruptive technologies \u201cbring to market a very different value proposition that had been available previously. Generally, disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally new) customers value\u201d (Christensen, 2000). Historically, managers have been hesitant to allocate resources to disruptive innovations because it doesn\u2019t make sense to do so. Schools can learn from this dichotomy. What if the STEM and language declines could be turned by an unknown or nonsensical value proposition? Not that we ignored it. It\u2019s just that making classes work in unusual combinations is difficult, especially when students are mostly choosing other subjects. It doesn\u2019t make sense to allocate resources that way. Although doing so, may be precisely what Australia needs if it is to address the aforementioned declines. This is a dilemma.", "The Alternative Value Proposition", "Consider the opening story. It\u2019s easy to consider wider factors when you\u2019ve suddenly found yourself red-faced in a culturally awkward situation and everything becomes crystal clear. But it\u2019s a tough sell to students and school administrators when the resource allocation doesn\u2019t make sense and the benefits only become apparent years later; potentially in another country, contributing to another country\u2019s economy. But could the complementary cultural themes across learning areas drive an awareness of unknown value propositions? Could a disruptive approach to designing learning pathways and resource allocation indeed contribute to reversing the STEM and languages declines? Maybe. But it will take vision, and risk taking to find out.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "References:", "ACARA. (2018). Rationale.

Intimidation and bullying of students is a particular issue, with 37 per cent of principals reporting that this occurs at least weekly in their school. Also of concern is the relatively high incidence of intimidation or verbal abuse of teachers or staff. Twelve per cent of Australian principals reported that this happens at least weekly, compared to three per cent on average across the OECD. The incidence of cyber-bullying, measured for the first time, was also relatively high compared to the average across the OECD.

This creates an environment where staff and school leaders can feel confident that they are working with the most up-to-date information on all wellbeing concerns.", "Whilst surveys like TALIS sometimes provide findings that we\u2019d rather not read about, they also contain many positive results. In addition, they remind us that education is continuously evolving and that educators need to evolve with it if Australia is to provide opportunities for excellence in teaching and learning. Sentral recognises that in a climate of increased accountability and regulatory compliance, time spent on teaching and learning is a critical priority. It\u2019s what drives Sentral to continue to innovate and evolve with the industry it serves.
