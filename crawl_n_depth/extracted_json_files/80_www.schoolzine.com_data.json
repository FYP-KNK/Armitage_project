I write the term relatively as I haven't used Schoolzine for a number of years and I need to re-familiarise myself with this. I'm sure that overtime, I will master the process and therefore can complete it in a more timely manner. I have found the phone support received from Schoolzine amazing. I have called them to ask even the smallest things and all staff on the other end of the phone have helped me to solve my queries. Again, overtime, I hope the number of phone calls I will make to Schoolzine will hopefully reduce as I gain more confidence navigating around the system, but it is definitely great to have the reassurance that the support is only a phone call away whenever I need it.

Everyone has been so polite and willing to help and answer questions and we have really appreciated this, especially their patience!", "We have been a customer of Schoolzine for a number of terms now and we have been really happy with Schoolzine\u2019s customer service. The support we have received has been outstanding. We save time and money compared to our old newsletter process. The process is simple and producing the newsletter cuts clerical time significantly. Parents have been very happy with the newsletter. The newsletter adjusts to their devices and most parents read the newsletter on their mobile phones. They enjoy seeing the videos and many photos we are now able to add to the newsletter. Using the eNewsletter allows us flexibility to add a variety of elements that create an engaging and attractive means of communication. We were very happy with the setup process and the training Schoolzine gave at the start of the partnership. Their ongoing support and promptness to answer questions has been outstanding. I highly recommend Schoolzine to all schools needing a modern form of communication with parents.", "Schoolzine\u2019s customer service is great. Whenever I call or email the response is very speedy and all the staff at Schoolzine are very helpful. The finished product looks great. It is easy to email the link to our parents and is equally easy to push it out via our app and website. I like how I can DIY minor changes and the control I have using the Schoolzine Dashboard. Creating our newsletter is much easier using Schoolzine, the time saved using the Style Sheet is immense. Once you setup your own school template it\u2019s just a matter of \u2018copy and pasting\u2019 the newsletter articles directly into the template and applying the style. I have created newsletters for 9 years and have been using Schoolzine for the past 18 months. It is much easier and the finished product is so much more professional and most importantly parents love it.", "I felt very supported by your team and am looking forward to putting together the second one a little more efficiently and confidently. It looked great and our community love the language options. I'm looking forward to familiarising myself with some of the other functions too.", "We have always been committed to providing quality learning, but to do that it is very important to be able to communicate in an effective way. With Schoolzine\u2019s website, we could fully customise it just how we wanted it and the look of it is fantastic. They have been very friendly, helpful and would highly recommend their service to any school looking for a new professional website.", "As a Principal I have used Schoolzine's services across two schools, and have followed their constant evolution as a company, now expanding internationally. Schoolzine constantly impresses us at Unity College with their commitment to innovation and education, even taking on students for work experience at their head office. They are a company that understands the educational landscape and provide high level support and excellent service.", "My school newsletter is a key strategy in my goal of creating a positive community partnership. Schoolzine has enabled my school to replace the cost of producing paper-based newsletters, an enormous saving.", "Working with Schoolzine has been an effortless and affordable process. There is excellent and instant online support where people walk you through the answers to any queries and questions at any time of the day. We now have one platform to distribute an online newsletter, school app and website that is easy to use and provides a professional and effective communication tool for our school community. It has really helped organise our whole school\u2019s information and halved the amount of time to distribute important messages to parents and the community.", "We are loving our new newsletter! It is great not to have to spend ages each week typing, formatting, printing, folding etc etc. It's also great to know that help is only a phone call or email away.

We are all very pleased with the look of our newsletter and all the support that we have received.", "So far we have been very pleased with the service that has been provided. Your staff have been more than willing to go through not only aspects of the newsletter, but also our SchoolZine website to edit and make use of other features, for example the calendar, etc. I'm sure I will be in contact with the production team again this week, as I am hoping to add some more features to our SchoolZine before our next newsletter. In terms of feedback, there hasn't been any issues. Staff have been very prompt in returning phone calls and emails, and our Principal was very happy with the design of the newsletter. Thanks for getting in contact with us to see how it all went. We appreciate your ongoing support.", "All support from your departments have been great. Great shout out to your team for sending out the emergency app for me last week! We had a bomb hoax and I had to send out a message through the app so our parents are updated. Your team did a great job to do it for me on the fly, seeing I was standing in the middle of an oval across the road from the school.", "The newsletter was great. The staff helping with the first edition were fantastic. I was able to ring at any time and any of the team I spoke to were happy to help and gave clear, precise instructions.", "I am finding the Newsletter process very easy it is such a user friendly process and I find that creating the Newsletter doesn\u2019t take too much time at all. The support that I received for the first run was excellent. I did have a few questions so I was utilising your staff a fair bit.", "I have been really impressed with Schoolzine and love using the newsletter feature. It has saved not only time and paper in producing our newsletter, but saved our sanity as well. It is a very user friendly system that is easy to navigate and understand, which is important for a beginner such as I am. The feature that I have found the most useful are the amazing quick links that have details explanations on how to produce, prepare, upload and proof the newsletter. These links have saved me from calling the help desk and sending them crazy. Thank you for giving me the tools to be confident in my abilities and be able to produce a quality newsletter with ease.", "The support and helpfulness I received from the Schoolzine Team was absolutely fabulous!

During this time we have assisted Schoolzine in turning an idea into a platform. One that specifically meets the needs of schools. Education departments all over the world are building complex cloud based portals and administration systems but they have not been able to solve the challenge of parent engagement to the extent that Schoolzine does. The issue of how to effectively communicate and engage parents of school aged children is a global challenge but one that has great benefits to our children if achieved. Schoolzine is uniquely placed in the education sector and in my opinion is another example of a home grown Australian company with a global opportunity. Schoolzine has shown itself to not only be a regional employer of youth but a company committed to providing work experience and internships to students looking to gain experience before entering the workforce. Our Federation will continue to assist Schoolzine in their growth, including introductions to our network overseas.", "We are excited to be part of schoolzine and are working to increase our newsletter content in the up coming months.

Workflow is excellent and this helps me to meet my deadlines. The whole Schoolzine partnership has been extremely positive and our members have been impressed by the quality and presentation of the newsletter. Most recently we have signed up for Schoolzine to host our website and this has gone very smoothly and using the website and adding items has become extremely easy. I have no hesitation recommending Schoolzine and encourage school leaders to contact them and see how easy it is.", "The Waikato Principal's Association has been using Schoolzine to publish its weekly newsletter for over a year.

This was so time consuming that we stopped using it as part of our promotions. As a result we struggled to find participants on the Sunshine Coast who were interested in attending our Social media workshops. We decided to talk with Schoolzine and Phil helped us to work out the right content and graphics to capture our target audience. We ran one series of advertising and achieved our highest number of attendees to a single workshop.", "Schoolzine's response to my initial enquiry was professional, informative and followed up by the same person throughout my entire business with Schoolzine.

The advertising system is easy to use and effective and I have no hesitation in recommending Schoolzine to any business looking for advertising solutions that reach out to parents.", "The whole team at Schoolzine were very helpful when it came time to decide if I wanted to have an advertisement in Varsity College's School eNewsletter.
