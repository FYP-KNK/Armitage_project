Moreover, her sister Emily had been a very successful marketer in the mobile and social media space. So between the two of them, they found the perfect match of skills to shake up the beauty industry with their innovative subscription box concept.", "\u00a0", "Given that Bellabox is a subscription business that introduces customers to new brands and products, there was a tremendous need for a robust marketing strategy in order to drive growth.

Now with the rise of Instagram, they have over 40,000 faithful followers and is proving to yet another medium for effective customer engagement.", "Sarah stresses on the mantra \u2018content is king\u2019.

After their initial few presentations, they were able to get a lot of feedback and mentoring from investors who were willing to invest in the new and growing area of subscription businesses and this helped them to come with the perfect pitch.", "Interestingly enough, having a calm attitude and adding humour to one\u2019s presentation can go a long way.

As a minister, Philip has been a prominent advocate for the technology and small business sectors in driving future growth in employment and GDP in Victoria.
