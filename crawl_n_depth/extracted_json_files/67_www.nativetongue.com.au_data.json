From aspects such as sound quality to specific things like which instrument to put where, I have never found Ben to fail me in bringing out the intricate beauties of a good song. Listening to his work both with Goldenhorse and lurking in the background of famous New Zealand albums, I can pick out the places where he has made his mark.

He introduced himself firstly as a sincere fan of our band, and we got to talking about music and all the good stuff. The very next day we ended up at his friend Wilder\u2019s house in Eagle Rock and we wrote and produced the song \u201cAxolotl.\u201d The vocal was sung directly into the keyboard of a laptop and was all completed very quickly. I then began to work with the band back in London and recording songs with Atom Greenspan, some of which were then taken to El-P during breaks in Run the Jewels hefty touring schedule and then messed with them further. We were also fortunate to work with Dean Hurley on one song in LA,\u201d says frontman Finn Andrews.", "Andrew adds, \u201cover a period of roughly 2 years an album began to take shape. There is a large cast of characters on this record. L. Ron Hubbard, Axolotls of course, kind natured crocodiles, a psychotic truck driver, The Pope and Ingrid Bergman all get a look in. The songs are all stories of various kinds; some experienced firsthand, others fabricated for my own amusement. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever written songs using mutilated loops and sounds as a starting point, though some of the songs also began on piano and were messed with later.\u201d", "The striking album cover is by the elusive Italian artist Nicola Samor\u00ed, known for the eerie beauty of his figurative work and a dedication to the preservation of classical styles and themes. The heavy Renaissance influence that runs through the body of his work is masterfully and systematically deconstructed to create pieces that are both romantic and violent; which makes his paintings all the more raw.", "\u201c\u2018Axolotl\u2019 boasts menacing instrumentation with Run The Jewels\u2019 trademark stomp-and-sludge slowed to a creeping march over which Andrews waxes poetic about the titular amphibian, amongst other vaguely-religious and horrific imagery. All the reverential doom and gloom reaches a fever pitch when Andrews proclaims: \u201cWho needs the devil when you\u2019ve got the lord?\u201d But by the time the dismally grand array of guitar solos and trumpets in the outro fade away, the Veils make the two opposing forces sound like one in the same.\u201d \u2013 Stereogum", "Finn Andrews (The Veils) has announced his first solo album, ", "One Piece At A Time", ".", "The album is one of Andrews\u2019 most profound pieces of work.

Then again, there\u2019s a lot about The Waifs that defies convention.", "This unlikely scenario unfolded when Vikki Thorn, her sister Donna Simpson and Josh Cunningham got together in a studio in Western Australia last year. The three mainstays of The Waifs hadn\u2019t seen much of each other since touring on the back of their last album, 2011\u2019s Temptation. The reunion called for a break with tradition. Instead of writing separately, the formula that has served them so well for almost 20 years, it was time for total collaboration. The three musicians would work together as a unit until a bunch of songs emerged.", "Much to their surprise, the three amigos drew a blank.", "\u201cIt was all very exciting,\u201d says Vikki. \u201cWe probably hadn\u2019t sat together in a room like that for 15 years. We got out pens and paper and guitars. It felt like it should be an easy thing \u2026 but it wasn\u2019t. We tried in earnest to jam and shape songs. We tried going through \u2018what\u2019s the worst Waifs song you\u2019ve ever written?\u2019 Even that became awkward because we couldn\u2019t all agree which were the worst ones. It was all very intimate and personal. Then Donna one day got the shits and went off and wrote a song.\u201d", "We can be glad she did. That moment of frustration opened the floodgates to what has become The Waifs\u2019 seventh studio album Beautiful You, an exquisitely crafted collection of songs from the three songwriters that bears all the hallmarks of a Waifs classic.", "\u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m just going to walk outside and write something\u2019,\u201d Donna recalls of that false start. \u2018It just kind of comes to me that way. It came and just kept rolling.\u201d", "In January 2015, aided by their regular rhythm section of drummer Dave Ross Macdonald and bassist Ben Franz, The Waifs entered 301 Studios in Byron Bay, NSW with producer Nick DiDia (Bruce Springsteen, Rage Against the Machine, Powderfinger) and emerged several weeks later with Beautiful You. The emotionally raw but musically buoyant Beautiful You demonstrates the easy chemistry that has bound The Waifs together for more than two decades, as well as celebrating the depth of songwriting talent they have at their disposal.", "The 12 new tracks \u2013 four from Donna, three from Josh and five from Vikki \u2013 play to the strengths of one of Australia\u2019s most enduring and lauded folk, pop and roots outfits. There\u2019s a familiar mix here of celebration and reflection, combined with that easy musical energy and intuition spawned from so many years of touring, whether in the pubs of rural Australia in the early days or on the road internationally ever since then. Beautiful You boasts abundant choruses, intoxicating instrumental exchanges and joyful harmonies, the characteristics that make so memorable the band\u2019s noughties hits London Still, Bridal Train and Sun Dirt Water.", "The title track, Donna\u2019s aching vocal drifting over a simple guitar motif, has a deeply personal undertow, a plea to a friend struggling with addiction: \u201cYou gotta change the road you\u2019ve been taking,\u201d sings Donna, \u201clay down your weapons and surrender.\u201d", "Simpson\u2019s shuffling, alt country ballad When a Man Gets Down, another personal account, this time of a relationship breakdown, is equally emotive. \u201cI sat bawling my eyes out when I wrote that song,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was something real that was happening in my life.\u201d", "Josh\u2019s country stroll Dark Highway is a gentle prod at humanity inspired by the night his van broke down and no one stopped to help him. He wrote the song in the back of the van to kill time until assistance arrived (\u201cobviously I eventually got out of there\u201d he says).", "Then there\u2019s the overtly poppy Blindly Believing, complete with a killer hook that explores the fleeting nature of love. Vikki wrote the song with WA singer Bex Chilcott, better known as Ruby Boots, in a session in Utah that marked Vikki\u2019s first attempt at co-writing and that produced several co-writes for Ruby Boots\u2019 debut album, Solitude.", "Donna\u2019s Rowena and Wallace is a bluesy coming-of-age romp punctuated by Vikki\u2019s harmonica stabs and Josh\u2019s piercing electric guitar, while Josh\u2019s Born to Love echoes the folk/blues swagger of his hit song Lighthouse from the band\u2019s breakthrough, ARIA Award winning album Up All Night (2003).", "Home has been in a variety of places for The Waifs during their career. Donna lives in Fremantle after spending eight years in Minneapolis, where the band recorded Temptation four years ago. Josh splits his time between California and the NSW south coast, where he\u2019s building a house for his family. Vikki is based in Utah. It\u2019s no accident that what inhabits Beautiful You most of all is that attachment to home, wherever that might be.", "Twenty-three years after Donna and Vikki set off from Albany to play music across Australia to anyone who would listen, teaming up with Josh en route, the three have come to appreciate the places they left behind. It\u2019s hardly surprising then that Vikki, who with her sister grew up at Cosy Corner Beach near Albany, WA, steeped in the simple, rural traditions of their salmon-fishing family, should reflect on and celebrate those things on the new album. This she does beautifully and longingly on the pulsing, heartfelt album opener, Black Dirt Track. \u201cThe longer I am away from Australia the more connected I feel to Australia and I keep writing songs about that,\u201d Vikki says. \u201cI grew up near the salmon camp where my grandfather fished, my father played there as a kid and when I go back there now I do the same things with my children. I physically feel connected to that place when I\u2019m there. It\u2019s almost a spiritual thing. It\u2019s where I grew up. It\u2019s where I learned to play guitar, where my husband proposed to me. I\u2019ve had all these deeply personal moments and significant things happen in this one place.\u201d", "There\u2019s a similar bent to 6000 Miles, on which Vikki contemplates the distance between her old home and her new one.", "The closing February, a sparse acoustic ballad that develops quickly into a full-tilt rocker, has Vikki anticipating warmer, brighter days: \u201cFebruary hitches up her skirt and rolls her stockings down,\u201d she sings.", "There are plenty of brighter days ahead for The Waifs. As Josh notes, \u201cthe relationship deepens\u201d. Beautiful You is a powerful statement of the individual songwriters\u2019 skills, their beliefs, their passions and their dreams. Bound together by expert musicianship and the love and respect that have developed between them since the early 1990s, it\u2019s also a moving, entertaining and ultimately joyful statement from a group of musicians dedicated to each other and to their craft.", "\u201cIt\u2019s still great to look across at each other and know where we are going to go with the music,\u201d says Donna. \u201cThat has never changed.

Taking a free form approach from Chris and bass guitarist/vocalist Tom Callwood\u2019s experiences in the city\u2019s improv and experimental scene, the album\u2019s cosmic vibes are an upshot of utilising gadgets to shapeshift each sound. Whilst synths were always built into the foundation\u2019s musical make-up, this time around they\u2019re placed centre stage; \u201cWe spent a great deal of time messing with an old eventide h3000.

The process was as soul-searching as Grobler has found album writing to be \u2013 life had changed a lot. Firstly, Grobler and his wife and bandmate Patricia Beranek found out at the end of touring previous album Matter (2016) that they were pregnant. Patti miscarried, but the idea of parenthood had nestled itself deep within Grobler and he began to seek an evolved role for himself. The other change was that the professional stakes felt higher. In fact, there was a point at which Grobler faced the question of whether Hyperion might be St. Lucia\u2019s final offering\u2026", "Grobler had become disassociated with traditional songwriting paths, particularly the LA sessions scene. He pondered about his inspirations, and studied the craft of some of his most cherished albums. \u201cWhen I think of all my favorite artists like Talk Talk, Kate Bush and Radiohead, their art is a pure expression of themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to write with some person who has twenty #1 hits. They\u2019re digging as deep as they can to find something purely from their perspective and hoping that translates into success.\u201d", "He felt a strong need to be similarly self-sufficient. The solitary voyage he would go on was riddled with self-doubt, confusion and uncertainty. \u201cI thought a lot about what kind of message I want to send to my kid,\u201d he reflects. \u201cIn many ways, the things we create as individuals have nothing to do with what other people are creating, or trends.\u201d As Grobler realized this he suddenly found himself unafraid of what everyone else was doing.", "Grobler wanted to go old school with the album\u2019s manifestation: playing as a band in the room with his co-conspirators \u2013\u00a0Ross Clark, Nick Paul, Dustin Kaufman and Patti. First, however, there needed to be songs, and with Grobler (a self-professed \u201cmusical hoarder\u201d) there were many thoughts to work through. It took the entirety of 2017 for the album to start congealing. There were moments of feeling lost, and for much of the process Grobler wondered why he was being pulled in two opposite directions.", "On the one hand he was knee-deep in studying the unabashed rock\u2019n\u2019roll of albums like Dark Side Of The Moon and Rumours. On the other he was wrapping his head around the likes of PC Music and St. Lucia\u2019s former tourmate Charli XCX, acts that are leading the futuristic pop game. \u201cI was going for this organic man-in-the-woods direction, but also thinking: how fake can I make it?\u201d Eventually he found a compromise by fighting to create the record with the band playing in a room together and creating the alive sensibility of a traditional rock album, but keeping the ambition modern. Once he had enough ideas, he threw caution to the wind and arranged the songs at the Brooklyn Navy Yard studios. \u201cEvery day we would tackle one song.\u201d It was intimate and fun, but more guidance was required.", "That\u2019s where legendary producer Rob Kirwan came in. The British maestro is responsible for records by PJ Harvey, Depeche Mode and U2. He\u2019s used to spending prolonged periods with people who like to take their time. Even more importantly here, he was a big fan of \u201980s English high-minded romantic pop. The pair went back into the studio and re-did all the band performances with that same high-minded pop in mind.", "A perfect example is \u201cParadise Is Waiting,\u201d featuring major piano chords, a clap-along rhythm and a mighty gospel choir. It captures a noble ambition Grobler has. His motivation is more than just songwriting, or performing live. Grobler seeks to generate a movement, a belief system, a religion almost. It\u2019s supposed to sound like church, it\u2019s supposed to make you feel joyous and purposeful. It seeks to bring light into your darkest hours.", "On that song, Grobler was inspired by soul singer Minnie Riperton and the gospel choirs she sang with. \u201cThey weren\u2019t singing about Jesus, but they had an undefined spirituality,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey had a reaching to them.\u201d Grobler is South African and grew up in the Christian tradition, but his religion is music. The way he talks about his process is highly spiritual. \u201cMy favorite music rouses me in a way I can\u2019t define. I don\u2019t write songs with intentional lyrics. These words come out. I only realize what it\u2019s about further down the line.\u201d \u201cParadise Is Waiting\u201d was a piano loop in his head for months. \u201cI\u2019ve never done LSD or hallucinogenics,\u201d he says. \u201cBut people\u2019s descriptions are the experience I feel when I come up with a song I love. The universe opens up, and there\u2019s this feeling of connectedness.\u201d", "The album\u2019s opening track, \u201cBigger,\u201d was actually the first song written for the album. \u201cIt\u2019s penned to my future child, and he wasn\u2019t conceived at that time,\u201d says Grobler. (Indy, his and Patti\u2019s son, was born in late 2017). The lyrical philosophy of the song sets the tone for a record that is in many respects about seeing the larger picture and your piece in the puzzle with clarity.", "Hyperion\u2019s themes feel vital and necessary for the times we live in. The song \u201cGun,\u201d for instance, is a play on the gun control debate, but also sexual relations from the point of view of power positioning. \u201cA man can feel this need to control a woman, but a woman has her own sexual power at the same time,\u201d he says. \u201cWalking Away\u201d is also about this debate. \u201cAre we really talking about the real issues or are there deeper issues at work that we don\u2019t want to talk about?\u201d ponders Grobler.", "The risk-taking he took has thrown up a truly unique album, in the sense that Hyperion is a record that\u2019s searching, inquisitive and culturally current while also sonically brimming with positivity, dance and funk. Imagine a politicized Daft Punk, or a theological Phoenix, and you\u2019re halfway there. It\u2019s an avant-garde pop album that makes you think. The title itself (suggested by Patti) comes from the Hyperion sci-fi books Grobler was reading. But upon researching the word, he learned that Hyperion was the Greek god of the sun and moon, which spoke to his search to balance his own inner light and darkness.", "\u201cI think that we need more positivity,\u201d he concludes. \u201cNot in a brain-dead way where we don\u2019t acknowledge problems, but rather to show there\u2019s a way to overcome them. You can make reactionary music that is negative and aggressive, but I gravitate towards the things that feel more inspirational. Social change has often come from a positive force, not an anarchistic one.

I thought, I would love to know what it\u2019s like to make people feel good and dance.\u201d", "Phantastic Ferniture\u2019s spiritual home may be the garage but they were born in a bar, specifically the hallowed basement of Frankie\u2019s Pizza in Sydney. One late night in 2014, on Jacklin\u2019s birthday, a group hug manifested amid the pinball machines, with all ten participants vowing to form a band. \u201cOnly four of us remembered the next day,\u201d notes Hughes.", "So that there could be no backing down, these four grifters booked a gig four months in the future at the Record Crate in Glebe. They advertised it as \u2018Phantastic Ferniture\u2019s Christmas Extravaganza First and Final Gig\u2019, then got back on with their lives. \u201cWe thought, that\u2019s ages away, we\u2019ll definitely have songs by then,\u201d Hughes recalls.", "On the night of the show, she and original bassist Tom Capell (later replaced by Stephens) were learning songs in the car park. \u201cWe realised in soundcheck that we were playing the same songs but in different keys,\u201d Hughes says. An hour later they were on stage before a bemused crowd, playing \u2018Take it Off\u2019, \u2018Fuckin and Rollin\u2019 (twice) and \u2018All I Want for Christmas Is You\u2019 by Mariah Carey. It was glorious and from the guts; in other words, everything they\u2019d hoped for.", "United by fern puns and a love of leisurewear, the band met up whenever schedules would allow, writing songs and playing smatterings of dates to an increasingly devoted audience. Eventually it was decreed that this was no side project and an album should follow.", "Whenever the band members could get into the same room, Brennan took the producer\u2019s role (as well as the drummer\u2019s seat): at Sydney\u2019s Studios 301, Defwolf and One Flight Up, with additional vocals tracked at The Sitting Room in New Zealand.", "The brief? More spontaneous and less technical than their solo projects. \u201cThat was the fun part,\u201d says Jacklin. \u201cRyan never played drums in bands, Liz had never been a lead guitarist, Tom didn\u2019t play bass and I\u2019d never just sung before\u2019. Liz adds, \u2018We wanted a low level of expertise, because a lot of good music comes from people whose passion exceeds their skill\u201d. True enough, butJacklin\u2019s vengeful vocal work in the climb to each chorus of \u2018Bad Timing\u2019 (with reproachful backing vocals from Hughes) has a sophistication that eludes most singers.", "Jacklin also felt relief at not having to imbue deep meaning into the lyrics, so that tracks like the psych-pop \u2018I Need It\u2019 and blissed-out \u2018Take it Off\u2019 operate from a more primal level. \u201cMy first instinct was to go simple and sexy, like a lot of good pop music,\u201d she says. Hughes agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018walking down the street, walking into a nightclub, feeling confident\u2019 type stuff.\u201d", "Then there\u2019s \u2018Mumma y Pappa\u2019 and \u2018Dark Corner Dance Floor\u2019, exuberantly youthful and brimming with newfound dark power.

In the Jesus and Mary Chain, which the Reids formed outside of Glasgow in 1984 with bassist Douglas Hart and drummer Murray Dalglish (quickly replaced by Bobby Gillespie), these two polarized aesthetics converged; equal parts bubblegum and formless guitar distortion, their sound both celebrated pop conventions and thoroughly subverted them.", "In late 1984, the band issued its seminal debut single, \u201cUpside Down,\u201d a remarkable blast of live wire feedback anchored by a caveman-like drumbeat; the record made the Mary Chain an overnight sensation in the U.K., as did their nascent live shows, 20-minute sets of confrontational noise (performed with the band\u2019s members\u2019 backs to the audience) which frequently ended in rioting. The follow-up, \u201cYou Trip Me Up,\u201d further perfected the formula, and led to their 1985 debut LP Psychocandy, which gift-wrapped sweet, simple pop songs in ribbons of droning guitar fuzz. After a two-year layoff (during which time Gillespie exited to form Primal Scream, and was replaced by John Moore), the Jesus and Mary Chain returned with Darklands, a dramatic shift in approach which stripped away the feedback to expose the skeletal guitar pop at the music\u2019s core. After a sprawling 1988 collection of singles, B-sides, and demos titled Barbed Wire Kisses, they emerged with Automatic, which introduced a more tightly coiled brand of feedback while jettisoning Moore\u2019s live drums in favor of synthesized beats.", "After another long absence, the Mary Chain (minus Hart) resurfaced in 1992 with Honey\u2019s Dead, and earned greater U.S. visibility thanks to a spot on that summer\u2019s Lollapalooza lineup; the first single, \u201cReverence,\u201d also won them renewed notoriety at home when Top of the Pops banned the song because of its opening lines, \u201cI wanna die just like Jesus Christ\u201d and \u201cI wanna die just like JFK.\u201d With 1994\u2019s gentle, largely acoustic Stoned & Dethroned, they even reached the U.S. pop charts thanks to the lovely single \u201cSometimes Always,\u201d a duet with Mazzy Star\u2019s Hope Sandoval.
