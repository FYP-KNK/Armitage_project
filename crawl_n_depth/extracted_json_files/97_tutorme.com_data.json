In a metal catalyzed reaction, if some amount of reactants is present then the metal surface is completely covered with the reactant molecules and under this condition the rate is a constant because it is controlled by what happens on the metal surface rather than the excess concentration. As a result the reaction reverts back to zero order reaction since the reactants are no longer used for the reaction. If they are used in the reaction then the reaction becomes first or second order. Since excess reactants are remained unused so it is zero order. }$", "$\\textup{Dissolving metal reductions reduce alkynes to trans alkenes.

But attempts to partially reduced terminal alkynes to alkene by this method fail. This is because alkyne reacts in the first step to produce alkynyl sodium species (sodium acetylide). Unlike substituted alkynes, terminal alkyne does not form any trans or cis radical. Sodium acetylide is formed exclusively. Since negative charge resides on the alkynyl carbon atom which is sp-hybridized, hence sodium acetylide resists reduction.

The smaller F-atoms form the most stable p-p $\\pi{}$-bond by efficient match of energy and size of the orbitals. Formation of an adduct with a base converts the geometry of bonds around boron from planar to pyramidal, thus rupturing the $\\pi{}$-bonds.

The idea of recursion is to solve a large problem by a \"divide and conquer\" approach. The larger problem is divided into smaller subproblems. And each of those subproblems is further divided into smaller sub-problems until we identify a sub-problem that we can solve quite easily. Once we solve the simplest sub-problem, we can use it to piece together the solution to the larger sub-problems until we solve our original problem.\n\nB) The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two natural numbers 'a' and 'b' is the largest number that divides both 'a' and 'b'. The most natural way to find the GCD of 'a' and 'b' is to list all the divisors of both 'a' and 'b' and then finding the largest divisor that belongs to both the lists. As you can imagine, this task becomes very difficult if 'a' and 'b' are large numbers.\n\nThe best way to solve this problem is by using Euler's algorithm. Euler's algorithm is based on the following principle:\n\n\"Let a and b be two numbers such that a is greater than b. Then, GCD(a, b) = GCD(a-b, b).\"\n\nFor example, GCD (15, 12) = GCD(3, 12) = 3\n\nWhile this principle looks like a simple observation, it is actually a powerful tool. As you can see, the principle essentially solves the problem of finding the GCD of 'a' and 'b', by finding the GCD of 'a-b' and 'b'. Note that since 'a-b' is actually smaller than 'a', it would be easier to find the GCD of 'a-b' and 'b'. But we needn't stop here! We can treat 'a-b' and 'b' as new numbers and apply this same principle once more. This way, with every repetition, we will keep reducing our numbers until we reach the case where the new \"a\" and \"b\" become equal (This is the easiest sub-problem to solve!). In this case, the GCD is simply the number itself, because a number is its own greatest divisor.\n\nConsider once again the GCD of 12 and 15:\n\nGCD (15, 12) = GCD (3, 12) = GCD (3, 9) = GCD (3, 6) = GCD (3, 3) = 3\n\nWhich is the answer we expected!\n\nThis solution (given below) is the perfect setup for implementing a recursive function. \n--------------------------------------\n#include <stdio.h>          // Include the console input/output header file\n\nint computeGCD (int a, int b)   //We define a function to compute the GCD of two numbers\n{\n    int gcd;\n    \n    if (a>b)           //We replace the bigger number by the difference between the two\n        a = a - b;\n    else if (a<b)   //We replace the bigger number by the difference between the two\n        b = b -a;\n    else               //But, in case the numbers are equal, the GCD is the number itself!\n    {\n        gcd = a;\n        return gcd;    //In that case we output the number itself and terminate the function\n    }\n\n    /**Once we replace the bigger number with a reduced number, we call the \"computeGCD\"  \n    function to find the GCD of the reduced numbers! **/\n    computeGCD (a, b);     \n}\n\nint main()   //This is the main function where we call computeGCD()\n{\n    int a, b;\n    printf (\"Enter two natural numbers a and b \\n\"); // We prompt the user to enter 2 nos.\n    printf(\"a : \");      \n    scanf (\"%d\", &a);     //We read user's first input and store it into a\n    printf(\"b : \");\n    scanf (\"%d\", &b);     //We read user's second input and store it into b\n    //We print the GCD by using the output of the function computeGCD\n\n    printf (\"The GCD of a and b is: %d \\n\", computeGCD(a,b));\n    return 0;\n}", "Insulin is produced by which cells in the pancreas?", "A) Delta cells\nB) Alpha cells\nC) Beta cells\nD) Gamma cells\nE) Epsilon cells", "Free ribosomes are located where in regards to a cell?", "A) Within the nucleus\nB) Intracellularly\nC) Extracellularly\nD) Free ribosomes are not a part of a cell structure", "Which of the following is not a carpal bone?\n\nA) Scaphoid\nB) Triquetrum\nC) Lunate\nD) Patella", "D) Patella", "Solve the equation $(\\dot{x}=xt+t^2+5$) using MATLAB", "The solution to the nonlinear ODE can be obtained easily using the MATLAB function ode45. ode45 is a numerical method based on the RK4 method for solving ODEs.\r\node45 requires a function which estimates and returns the RHS of the governing ODE.

Since all the forces are balanced by each other, the aircraft does not accelerate. But the forces often lead to some pitching moments about the center of gravity which makes the aircraft unstable. Horizontal tails are components that are used to ensure that the net pitching moment about the center of gravity of the aircraft is zero. They are aerodynamically shaped and hence prduce a lift and drag force when it flows through air. By properly positioning the horizontal tail ( effectively changing the moment arm about cg ), the net pitching moment can be made to be 0, thus providing stability to the aircraft.

This shape is often described as a spiral staircase or twisted ladder. DNA is a nucleic acid with three main components: nitrogenous bases, deoxyribose sugars, and phosphate molecules. Interactions between water and the molecules that compose DNA cause this nucleic acid to take on a twisted shape. This shape aids in the packing of DNA into chromatin fibers, which condense to form chromosomes. The helical shape of DNA also makes DNA replication and protein synthesis possible. When necessary, the double helix unwinds and opens to allow DNA to be copied.", "What's the best way to tackle GMAT Analytical Writing Assesment?", "Remember that GMAT AWA is more of an argument analysis than an essay-writing question. Your proficiency in grammar and your adroitness with vocabulary, while good, will not play a great role in fetching you a 6 on 6 in GMAT AWA. Your argument is analyzed by a programmed computer first and then by a person. The best way, in my opinion, to tackle this section is to stick to the below format (it helped me get a 6 on 6 in my GMAT):\n\n1st Paragraph - Restate the crux of the argument in simple terms and clearly specify if you are for or against the presented argument.\n\n2nd Paragraph - Write 'Firstly'......followed by your strongest argument to support or counter the question statement.\n\n3rd Paragraph - Write 'Secondly'.....followed by your second logical argument\n\n4th Paragraph - Write 'Finally' ....followed  by your final argument\n\n5th Paragraph - Write 'To conclude/To Summarize'....Follow it by a one-line summary of the 3 points you have mentioned above. State that 'On the pretext of the above-mentioned points'....followed by your conclusion (whether you support or counter the question stem). Also, state a way or two to improve or strengthen the argument or how can the veracity of the stated argument be verified.\n\nThat's it!

Imagine the transfer of heat. Heat is a flow of energy from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature (the temperature gradient). Heat continues to flow between tow bodies unless their temperatures become equal. Similar is the flow of electricity. Instead of a difference of temperatures and the creation of a consequent temperature gradient, in this case, there is a difference in potentials (potential gradient). Current flows across the potential gradient as long as the potentials on both the fronts are equalized.", "If a certain score distribution has the following properties:\n\nMean : 70\nMedian : 73\nStandard deviation : 10\n\nWhat would change after a curve of 5 points for each student?", "You don't need to know any formulae to answer this question, so its okay if standard deviation confuses you. Just think about each term conceptually. If everyone's score increases, will the average value also change? Yes, so the mean will go up 5 points. If I arrange the scores in an increasing order, note the score in the middle, and then increase each score by 5 points, will the middle score also change? Yes, so the median will increase by 5. Standard deviation is just how far each score is from the mean. If the mean increased by 5, because each score increased by 5, then the distance to the mean would remain constant, so the standard deviation won't change.", "Why would you want to use NumPy arrays instead of lists in Python?", "Speed is probably the most important aspect. Arrays are much faster in the sense that reading and writing values is more efficient. This is also because arrays take up less memory than standard lists. Another huge advantage of arrays is the availability of linear algebraic operations. In the fields of finance and statistics, it is essential to be able to execute large-scale mathematical functions on a set of data, and that is substantially easier to do with arrays.", "Why does the sky look blue normally but red/yellow during a sunset?", "Our atmosphere is made up of tiny gas molecules, mainly comprised of Oxygen and Nitrogen. Sunlight is made up of all kinds of different wavelengths, essentially all kinds of colors. During the day, the sun is right above our heads so the light has to travel a smaller distance to reach our eyes. During this small time, blue light is scattered by the gas molecules in all directions, leading to a blue sky. During sunset, the sun is slightly distant from us, due to the Earth's rotation. The extra distance leads to the blue light being completely scattered, or removed, before reaching our eyes. So by the time the light reaches our eyes, only red and yellow light remain.", "Integrate $$ \\int\\mathrm x{e}^{x^2},\\mathrm{d}x $$", "Substitution: $$u=x^2$$ -> $$ \\frac{du}{dx}=2x$$ -> $$\\frac{du}{2}=xdx$$ \r\n\r\nSo $$ \\int\\mathrm x{e}^{x^2},\\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{2} \\int\\mathrm {e}^{u},\\mathrm{d}u =  \\frac{1}{2}{e}^{u}+C = \\frac{1}{2}{e}^{x^2}+C $$", "Could you explain Newton's three laws of motion without using equations, in layman's terms and in 15 minutes?", "The Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws (that is, three \"rules\" that everything in the Universe follows) that explain the motion of things and define the concept of \"force\".\r\n\r\nNewton's first law: \"Every body persists in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed.\"\r\n\r\nThat is: if a still object never interacts with anything, that object will never start moving. If an object in motion never interacts with anything, it will move in a straight line and with the exact same velocity forever and ever. If an object changes its velocity, or doesn't move in a straight line, or suddenly stops or starts moving, it is necessarily interacting with something; that is, a \"force\" is acting upon the object.\r\n\r\nNewton's second law: \"The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.\"\r\n\r\nThat is: changes in \"momentum\" (which is simply the mass of an object times its velocity, and what Newton called \"motion\") are proportional to and happen in the direction of the net force (the sum of all forces) that acts upon the object. We can rewrite Newton's second law as follows: the net force acting upon an object in an instant is equal to the variation of the momentum in that instant (technically speaking, to the time derivative of the momentum). This means that if the mass of the object doesn't change, the net force that acts upon an object is simply its mass times its acceleration. \r\n\r\nNewton's third law: \"To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.\"\r\n\r\nThis one law may look particularly obscure or difficult to understand, but it is not. It simply states that all forces are equal \"interactions\" between objects. Every force is accompanied by a simultaneous force of equal magnitude and opposite direction, because both objects are part of the same interaction.", "What is the difference between a vector and a matrix?", "None! Vectors are simply matrices with just one row or one column. You can apply everything you know about matrices to vectors!\r\n\r\nBe careful, though, not to mistake the functions you use with vectors with those you use with matrices. For example, the dot product is not the same as the matrix product: it is a \"special\" type of matrix product in which it doesn't matter if the involved vectors are columns or rows: it will always be equivalent to multiplying a row vector with a column vector. \r\n\r\nLet's see an example. \r\n$$\\vec{u_{1}}$$ and $$\\vec{u_{2}}$$ are two vectors:  $$\\vec{u_{1}}=\\begin{pmatrix}a\\\\b\\end{pmatrix}$$ and  $$\\vec{u_{2}}=\\begin{pmatrix}c\\\\d\\end{pmatrix}$$\r\nThe matrix product $$\\vec{u_{1}}\\vec{u_{2}}=\\begin{pmatrix}a\\\\b\\end{pmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{pmatrix}c\\\\d\\end{pmatrix}$$ does not exist (\"it is not defined\"), because the number of columns of the first matrix (1) does not match the number of rows of the second matrix (2). \r\nHowever, the dot product $$\\vec{u_{1}}\\cdot\\vec{u_{2}}$$   is   $$\\vec{u_{1}}\\cdot\\vec{u_{2}}=\\begin{pmatrix}a & b\\\\\\end{pmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{pmatrix}c\\\\d\\end{pmatrix}=ac+bd$$, which is exactly the matrix product of a one row matrix with a one column matrix. \r\n\r\n(Note, however, that if $$\\vec{u_{2}}=\\begin{pmatrix}c & d\\\\\\end{pmatrix}$$, then the matrix product $$\\vec{u_{1}}\\vec{u_{2}}=\\begin{pmatrix}a\\\\b\\end{pmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{pmatrix}c & d\\\\\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}ac & ad\\\\bc & bd\\end{pmatrix}$$; the matrix product of two vectors can exist and be different from the dot product!).", "For the reaction: $$2CO + O_2 \\to 2CO_2$$\r\nWhat is the theoretical yield of $$CO_2$$ in grams from $$5g \\, O_2$$ and excess $$CO$$?", "We start with the $$5g$$ of $$O_2$$.
