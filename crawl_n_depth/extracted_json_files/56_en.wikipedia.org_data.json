Love waves are formed by horizontally polarized S-waves interacting with the surface, and can only exist if there is a change in the elastic properties with depth in a solid medium, which is always the case in seismological applications. Surface waves travel more slowly than P-waves and S-waves because they are the result of these waves traveling along indirect paths to interact with Earth's surface. Because they travel along the surface of the Earth, their energy decays less rapidly than body waves (1/distance", "2", " vs. 1/distance", "3", "), and thus the shaking caused by surface waves is generally stronger than that of body waves.

Surface waves are strongly excited when their source is close to the surface, as in a shallow earthquake or a near surface explosion, and are much weaker for deep earthquake sources.", "[12]", "\n", "Both body and surface waves are traveling waves; however, large earthquakes can also make the entire Earth \"ring\" like a resonant bell.

This climbing action prevents shading by neighbors and allows the vine to grow out of reach of herbivores.", "[16]", " The environment where a vine can grow successfully is determined by the climbing mechanism of a vine and how far it can spread across supports. There are many theories supporting the idea that photosynthetic responses are closely related to climbing mechanisms.\n", "Temperate twining vines, which twist tightly around supports, are typically poorly adapted for climbing beneath closed canopies due to their smaller support diameter and shade intolerance. In contrast, tendril vines usually grow on the forest floor and onto trees until they reach the surface of the canopy, suggesting that they have greater physiological plasticity.", "[17]", " It has also been suggested that twining vines revolving growth is mediated by changes in turgor pressure mediated by volume changes in the epidermal cells of the bending zone.", "[18]", "\n", "Climbing vines possess many unique characteristics in response to changes in their environments.

This demonstrates the vine's ability to self-discriminate, which has only been previously documented in roots.\n", "In tendrilled vines, the tendrils are highly sensitive to touch and the coiling action is mediated by the hormones octadecanoids, jasmonates and indole-3-acetic acid. The touch stimulus and hormones may interact via volatile compounds or internal oscillation patterns.", "[20]", " Research has found the presence of ion translocating ATPases in the Bryonia dioica species of plants, which has implications for a possible ion mediation tendril curling mechanism. In response to a touch stimulus, vanadate sensitive K+, Mg2+ ATPase and a Ca2+ translocating ATPase both rapidly increase in their activity.
