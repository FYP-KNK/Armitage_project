The case analysis revealed that Nokia spends excessively on R&D as compared to entire industry expenditure on R&D, but despite making such huge expenditure, the company is not able to introduce smart phones that can compete against iPhone as produced by Apple Inc. This has adversely affected the market shares of the company and it has become a significant managerial issue for the company to revive its brand name.", "Rationale for Investigating the Problem:\u00a0", "The main rationale behind investigating this managerial issue is that despite making significant efforts in terms of R&D expenditure, Nokia is not able to present a smart phone that can compete strongly against iPhone. Thus, the investigation of this issue will lead to the identification of the factors that caused company to face such severe threat of declining market share and the actual reasons for the problems could be better identified.", "Argument in Carrying out this Investigation:\u00a0", "On the basis of analysis of Nokia\u2019s case, it has been argued that R&D activities alone would not enable a company to achieve higher market success; rather, it should be used in combination with the managerial leadership abilities to effectively utilise the findings and investment made in R&D.", "The performance of a critical analysis of the Nokia\u2019s case indicates that the major issue with the company is its declining share price because of its inability to bring newer products into the market. The case of Nokia revealed that it spent $40 billion on research and development which is almost equivalent to four times what Apple has spent in the same financial year. Despite making such huge R&D expenditure, Nokia was unable to launch a smart phone that can effectively compete against the iPhone. The managerial issue as evident in the case of Nokia suggests that the management has not been able to introduce the right smart phones in the market that can compete with Apple and Samsung. The managerial problems as faced by Nokia is also clearly evident from the fact that Nokia has actually developed few products and designs, but the managers within the company failed to introduce them into the market on time. This is the major strategic blunder on the part of management of the company. Further, its inability to compete with the iPhone has resulted into the shift in its focus from smart phones to its basic phones. This is the major contributing managerial problem which led to the problem of declining market share of Nokia (Smith, Collins and Clark, 2005).", "According to a study conducted by Rosier, Morgan and Cadogan (2010), the principle challenge to firms is with respect to the ways in which strategies developed are implemented successfully by them. The managers within the organisations have a critical role to play in performing the successful implementation of strategies in order to achieve success. But this aspect has been lacking in respect to Nokia in the case, as the management of the company has failed to cope up with the market situation. As per the case, Nokia led the wireless revolution in 1990 and it was the first company to enter into the world of smart phones. However, with the introduction of the smart phone era, the company is racing to roll out the competitive products, as its share prices have collapsed significantly. Instead of bringing new smart phones to the market, the company seems to withdraw as it is unable to launch a competitive smart phone as against Apple iPhone. This aspect clearly indicates that the lack of sufficient ability of the management at Nokia to revolutionise the market through its smart phones (Rosier, Morgan and Cadogan, 2010).", "Another major area of problem as identified from the case analysis of Nokia is that the company has recently introduced a series of Nokia Lumia phones which is basically a type of windows phone. But such introduction of Nokia Lumia phones has not been successful in allowing the company to achieve the lost market shares. Despite making huge expenditure over the R&D function, Nokia is still struggling to turn its new ideas into its product and the resulting impact is its further decline in the sales and market position across industry. On the basis of analysis, it has been argued that the innovation is essential to be performed in order to achieve success in the market, as the introduction of windows phone by Nokia has resulted into similar kinds of phones being brought by Samsung into the market. This has affected the performance of Nokia\u2019s Lumia phones significantly and it is clearly evident over the market shares of the company (Bowman and Gatignon, 1995).", "The fact that innovation is crucial to a firm\u2019s success is also supported by Panne, Beers and Kleinknecht (2003) by indicating that innovation allows the firms with opportunities to offer something new and distinctive apart from their competitors. However, in order to achieve success in innovation, there are various factors that act as determining factors and these include firm\u2019s culture, the experience with innovation, the multidisciplinary character of R&D team and the support from the top management. The analysis of the case of Nokia suggests that all these aspects are mostly lacking in respect to the company, as the managers were not able to introduce the new concepts into their products, the R&D team failed to utilise the key findings in introducing new products into the market and finally, the management\u2019s approach also seems to be highly laggard, as despite introducing new and innovative smart phones, the management has undertaken decisions to take back their approach from introducing new and highly advanced smart phones to other small range of phones (Panne, Beers and Kleinknecht, 2003).", "The analysis of the case leads to the identification of another major significant issue as faced by Nokia is the timely introduction of new products into the market. It has been argued that the higher level of benefits can be achieved from a product provided it has been introduced in the market on timely basis. This requires a proactive approach on the part of management of an organisation, as the important findings from the R&D activities should be reflected in their products on timely basis so as to achieve maximum level of benefits from it (Baker and Sinkula, 2005). However, in respect to Nokia, this aspect has been significantly lacking, as the analysis of the case revealed that Nokia has devised the concept of a colour touch screen phone which is set above a single button and this concept is mainly planned by the Nokia team seven years before Apple Inc. The device was shown locating a restaurant, playing a racing game and ordering lipstick. But the main issue was that it remained a plan for the company, and it never launched its innovative ideas into the market through its product offering. If the company have introduced all such innovations in its product offerings to its customer for the first time, it would have better position throughout the entire mobile industry.", "Thus, the analysis of the Nokia case indicates that there are various managerial issues as faced by the company which has resulted into significant decline in the level of market share. Despite making efforts in the form of huge spender in R&D activities, Nokia failed to introduce new smart phones that could compete against iPhone and the inability to introduce its innovative ideas into the market through its product have all caused the mobile phone company to bear significant amount of loss in its market share.", "In this report, a critical investigation of the management issues as faced by Nokia from the analysis of a case study has been performed, and the investigation revealed significant number of issues that are faced by the organisation behind its core problem of declining market shares. The analysis of the case leads to identification that Nokia made huge R&D spending and despite such effort, it has not been able to launch a smart phone that can compete in the industry. The major managerial issues as identified from the case analysis suggest that Nokia has failed to successfully integrate the strategies as developed by it into its products. Secondly, it has performed innovation in launching new smart phones, but they were not that innovative to compete against iPhones and other smart phones by Samsung, and thirdly, even after devising important innovative concepts, it failed to introduce them into the markets.

There are variety of carbonated water includes under the brand name of Schweppes. Schweppes has its operations in the Australian markets as well.

With respect to Schweppes, the company also has vision as well as mission statements with a clear indication of the values that the company wants to incorporate in all the activities as undertaken by it. The mission of the company is to delight its customers with fun, refreshing and natural moments of pleasure. As the company deals in beverages products, the aim of the company has been to provide a feeling of freshness to its customers from its product offerings. In order to attain its mission statement of satisfying its customers with fresh products, it also customize its products that best suites the need of its customers, as it can be evident from the fact that the declining trend of sugar consumption among the Aussies is reflected in the policies of the company to reduce the level of sugar in its flavored mineral water.

Environmental analysis as the name indicates the assessment of the environment in which a company is performing its business functions. All the factors that need to be assessed in the performance of environmental analysis of a company are external to it. The external factors have a huge impact on the performance of a company, as they have a direct impact on all the daily activities that are being performed within the company. Thus, the consideration of environmental aspects becomes crucial in assessing the overall performance of an industry operating in a particular country (Kleibohmer 2001).", "The need for performing the environmental analysis for a particular industry gets further increased in cases when a company decides to expand its operations in the international market. The expansion of business activities in the global market becomes a common phenomenon for the companies operating across the world and as such, the effectiveness in the decision to expand in the international market can be achieved by examining the environmental conditions for the industry in the international market. The impact that the political conditions have on the performance of the same industry in the international market needs to be assessed. In addition to this, the economic performance of the country in terms of GDP growth rate, inflation, unemployment rate also need to be assessed in order to take a better decision of expanding into the international market. Apart from the political and the economic conditions, there are various other factors that need to be considered in performing the environmental analysis of a country for a particular industry,. These factors include the cultural, technological, environmental and legal forces that are prevailing in the country and have a direct impact on the performance of the industry (Graham 2008).", "In the given case of Schweppes, the proposed entry of the company into the Indian market for trapping the opportunities that are available in the bottled water industry also requires the company to have a proper assessment of all the environmental factors that have a direct bearing on the performance of bottled water companies. The identification of the environmental factors that have an impact on the bottled water industry in the Indian markets would require Schweppes to formulate necessary strategies so that the impact of environmental factors on the performance of the company in the international market can be reduced and overall developments of the company can ultimately be achieved. Thus, the major environmental factors that govern the bottled water industry in India which needs to be taken into consideration by Schweppes in its decision to expand its bottled water in the Indian market are discussed as follows:", "Political Environment:\u00a0", "The political aspects that prevail in a country are most crucial to be assessed in order to consider the expansion of business into that particular country. With respect to bottled water industry in India, the political factors have a major dominance over the bottled water companies operating in India. There are various independent bodies that are operating within the country in order to keep a close watch on the beverages regarding their compliance with all the necessary regulations that have been set. For instance, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) is one such non profit non governmental organization that operates in the country and keeps a close eye on all the necessary compliances that are being set for the beverages companies operating within the country. The main aim of CSE is to raise awareness among the common individuals that resides in the economy pertaining to the issues related to environment and development that have a direct impact on such individuals. CSE was active in identifying various issues with respect to Coca-cola and Pepsi regarding the level of pesticides (McKee and Lamb, 2009). In addition to this, CSE has also found extremely harmful pesticides in some of the popular brands of bottled water in some of the Indian states. This has also resulted into stringent political actions and finally leads to the development of strict rules that needs to be adhered by the bottle manufacturers in the country. With respect to the packaged drinking water, the BIS standard applicable is (IS: 14543) and for the packaged mineral water, the standard applicable is (IS: 13428). However, there were certain modifications that have been made to these standards in 1998 in order to ensure maximum protection with respect to the mineral water production in the country. This indicates that the political interventions in form of compliance with the laid down standards have been crucial in India and as such, Schweppes need to consider the political aspects before expanding its bottle water plant in India (Executive summary and recommendations of the committee on the pesticides residue in packaged drinking water and packaged natural water 2011).", "In addition to this, the ISI certification is also considered to be essential for the bottled water brands that are operating and plan to operate in India by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). BIS considered the bottled water industry as an industry that has a low cost with respect to barriers to entry and exit, as there are very few types of equipment that are essential for the manufacturers to manufacture bottled water. BIS issues necessary licenses to the bottled water manufacturer and that needs to be obtained by each manufacturers in successfully operating in the bottled water industry in India (India and the Regulation of Bottled Water 2011).", "Economical Environment:\u00a0", "In addition to the political environment, the performance of the economic environment of the country is also essential to be assessed. The economic growth of the country in terms of the GDP growth rate, rate of inflation in the economy, growth of particular industry within the economy etc are also essential to be assessed in order to have a better decision making concerning the expansion into an international market. As a result of this, it becomes essential for Schweppes to consider the economic environment that prevails in the Indian economy in order to make the expansion of its bottled water product into the market of India.", "With respect to the economic growth of India, the country has achieved significant economic growth over the years. There has been a steady increase in the growth of the economy since 1979 and by the financial year 2005-06, the country has achieved a growth rate of 6.9% in its GDP. By the financial year 2009-10, it has reached the benchmark of 8% and for the financial year 2010-11, the growth is being estimated at 8.5% (India Estimates 2010 Economic Growth 2010). From the perspective of overall growth of the economy, the Indian economy is considered effective for Schweppes in expanding its bottled water operation into the Indian markets. In addition to this, the market with respect to the bottled water in India is also very good and achieving significant growth rates over the year. It has also been projected that there would be significant growth that would be achieved in the Indian bottled water industry in the years to come. The growth will be experienced in case of both the industrial water as well as the drinking water. The growth in the water market in the country is identified as 15-20% annually. As per the recent assessment done by the government, the growth in the water market is observed at 55% on an annual basis. The total Indian water market is valued at Rs 1000 crores and it has a growth rate of around 40%. The market is also being expected to achieve huge benchmark in the near future and has also crossed the 4000-5000 crores benchmark in 2010 (Murthy 2011). Overall, the economic performance of the country and also the performance of the bottled water industry in the country seem to be growing at a rapid pace, which would ultimately be considered as favorable for Schweppes in expanding its bottled water operations in the Indian market (Bottled Water set to become billion-dollar industry 2009).", "Technological Environment:\u00a0", "It is also considered as one of the most important aspects of the environmental assessment. The development in the economy in terms of technology is also essential to be assessed, so that the decision pertaining to the expansion into the country can be made in a most effective manner. With respect to the technological developments in the country, there has been significant development that has been experienced with respect to such development in 2010. Although, the implication of technology is not at a high level in the process of manufacturing bottled waters, yet, it can be applied in order to gain significant achievements with respect to the quality of water and also with the compliance procedures that are essential to meet in order to successfully operate in the bottled water segment in the country. There has been computerization in all the fields within the country. However, the technological developments in case of bottled water industry in India are still very slow and there lies a huge scope for further development. The bottled water segment in India is highly unorganized and there has been a rapid need for further development in the field of technology in the bottled water industry so that the overall developments in terms of quality of water can be possible (Bottled water India n.d).", "Cultural and Legal Environment:\u00a0", "These are other important aspects that need to be considered in the process of assessing the environment of a particular country. The cultural as well as the legal aspect forms the basis for the overall assessment of the environment of a country. For Schweppes, it becomes essential to know the culture that prevails in the Indian market, as all the strategies pertaining to communication about its bottled water product requires the company to know the prevailing culture, so that it can easily target its customers. For instance, in case of Europe, there has been a culture of drinking bottled water with wine at meal times. This type of culturally related aspects is very much essential to be aware of by the companies, when they plan to expand their operations in the international market (Bottled water industry-Global Overview 2011). In addition to the cultural aspect, the consideration of legal aspects is also very essential as it may directly impacts the performance of the entire business. The legal rules that are being formulated in the country should be adhered while conducting the business in the country. As such, the consideration of all the legal aspects with respect to the bottled water industry in India should need to be complied by Schweppes in its expansion of bottled water product in the Indian market. For instance, the rules and regulations as framed by BIS and the various standards applicable to the Indian bottled water market such as IS: 14543 and IS: 13428 should be complied by Schweppes while entering into the Indian bottled market (Executive summary and recommendations of the committee on the pesticides residue in packaged drinking water and packaged natural water 2011).", "Thus, the overall assessment of the external environment of Indian bottled water market indicates that it is favorable enough for Schweppes to enter such Indian market with its bottled water products in the country. All the political, legal, technological, cultural as well as economical factors support the expansion of bottled water products in the Indian economy. The continuous growth of the bottled water industry in the country is quite effective which also adds towards the decision of the company to expand its operations in the Indian markets and trap the opportunities available in such market.", "The acronym for SWOT analysis is strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Strengths and Weaknesses are internal to organization and opportunities and threats are external to the organization. SWOT analysis helps in assessing both the internal as well as external environment of an organization. In case of Schweppes, it becomes essential to conduct a SWOT analysis of the company after looking at the proposed decision of company\u2019s expansion of the bottled water segments in the Indian market.", "Strengths represent the strong points of the company. The analysis of Schweppes indicates that the major strength point of the company is that it has been an acceptable global brand in terms of beverages. It has its operations in almost all parts of the world which indicates that the company has the potential to effectively serve the international market with its brand. The acceptance of the brand name as the favorable brand all across the world is another major advantage as enjoyed by the company over the other brand. Another major strength point of the company is that it was able to maintain a stable growth rates from its operations (SWOT Analysis and Report for Cadbury Schweppes \u2013 Business Research Paper 2011). This would also encourage the company to ensure success in its proposed expansion of bottled drinking water in the Indian bottled water market. Apart from this, company also offers flavored mineral water to its customers. This can be considered to be one of the major advantages for the company as no such companies in India offers flavored drinking water. As a result, it would become possible for the company to serve a different class of customers with its flavored water in the Indian bottled water market (Schweppes 2011).", "As far as the weaknesses of the company are concerned, there are various segments in which the company presently deals in, such as Cadbury confectionery, beverages etc. In addition to this, the operation of the company can also be found in almost all parts of the world. As a result, it would become a difficult task for the management to ensure the effective management of its expansion of beverage section in the Indian market. Further, the lack of experience in the Asian region is also another major weakness of the company. However, the company would develop its brand name from its operation in the Indian market over a period of time (Schweppes 2011).", "Apart from the weaknesses, the opportunities available to the company are enormous, as can be identified from the external environment analysis that has been performed in the aforementioned section. The major opportunities available to the company are that the Indian bottled water market has the high chance of growth in the near future. As a result, it becomes possible for Schweppes to track the opportunities from the Indian market. Further, the Indian bottled water industry is also highly supportive to the bottled water manufacturer in the sense that barriers to entry and barriers to exit is very low in case of Indian bottled water market (Bottled Water Industry in India 2006).", "Finally, there also have certain threats that need to be faced by Schweppes in its proposed expansion to Indian bottled water market. The major threat is in the form of stiff competition that exists between the two major bottled water manufacturers such as Pepsi and Coca-cola. Because of having intense competition between them, it would become essential for Schweppes to remain competitive in order to survive in such bottled water market. Apart from the two major giants operating in the market, there are various local brands of bottled water manufacturers that are operating in the country. They also pose severe challenges to the big giants operating in the country. As a result, it becomes essential that the company needs to have a well developed strategy in order to effectively deal with the threats that persists in the Indian bottled water industry (Bottled Water Industry in India 2006).", "Implications from the SWOT Analysis:", "\u00a0The SWOT analysis as performed indicates that it has been a favorable condition to Schweppes in expanding its bottle water operations in the Indian market because such market supports the entrance of a bottled water manufacturer. There are huge opportunities available and by leveraging on the existing strengths, the company can achieve huge success. However, the weaknesses and threats imposes certain kinds of restrictions which can easily be overcome through the formulation of better strategies regarding business expansion.", "In order to achieve success in the present complex business environment, it becomes essential for the companies to successfully market their brands in the market so that most of the potential customers for the products of the company can easily be targeted. There should be specific objectives from the marketing activities as undertaken by the companies. The set up of specific objective from its marketing activities enables the companies to focus on each and every aspect of the marketing activities undertaken by it, so as to achieve the objectives set for such activities.", "As far as the marketing objectives of Schweppes is concerned, the company\u2019s marketing objective is to enable its consumers to aware of the fact that their health should be the primary concern for them and in order to maintain their health, they can consume the healthier products as offered by the company. Thus, the main objectives of the company behind marketing its products is to increase the health related awareness among its target consumers so that the achievement of a definite increase in the sales for the products as offered by the company can be possible. The promotion of a healthy lifestyle becomes the primary objective of the company from the marketing of its products (Urban 1975). \u00a0The company pays high attention towards the health related aspects of its consumers, as it can be evident from the fact that a rise in the level of obesity among its consumers in the western countries would result into the promotion on the part of the company that its products should be consumed in a balanced diet. This aspect of promoting its product indicates that the company is highly concerned with the health related aspects of its consumers. Ultimately, by becoming health conscious, the company aims at achieving increased sales for its health related products. In addition to this, the marketing objectives of the company also include the promotion of its products as stylish, interesting, cool as well as refreshing. With these objectives in mind, the promotions of the product are being performed so that the accomplishment of all such marketing objectives can ultimately be possible (Ferrand, Torrigiani and Camps 2006).", "The segmentation of market is one of the most important tasks to be undertaken by companies in targeting their products to the consumer. The importance of segmenting the market further increases with the planning of the company to expand its operation in a new international market. \u2018Market segment\u2019 can be defined as a group of customers that have the similar characteristics. The product for a particular market segment is homogenous and the customers in that market segment also have the similar needs (Croft 1994). The main purpose of the developing a market segment is to allow the marketing professionals to focus on the particular purchases offerings (Peter and Donnelly 2002). It helps to provide highest return from the expenses on the marketing or sales programs. Looking at the benefits from market segmentation, it is essential for Schweppes to perform the segmentation of Indian bottled water market so that it can focus on a particular segment and leverage the opportunities available in such market. For the purpose of segmenting the target market, it is essential to identify the target market for bottled water industry in India.", "Target Market:\u00a0", "Target Market for any product includes that particular segment to which the product can easily be launched at the initial phase. Target market comprises of group of customers who are being targeted with the product by means of various kinds of marketing campaign so that the customers can be persuaded to purchase the company\u2019s product. The selection of target market is essential as it helps the company in maintaining its focus over a particular segment and ultimately, all the strategies are being devised on the basis of the need of the selected target group. With respect to the Schweppes, the target market basically includes the young and middle aged professionals who often need bottled water while travelling. In addition to this, the tourists that come to the country can also become the target market for the bottled water in India (Weinstein 2004). A brief description of the target profile on the basis of demography, psychographic, geographic and benefits is discussed as follows:", "Demographic:\u00a0", "On the basis of demographic segmentation, market for the bottled water can be classified in terms of the age group of the target audience. As already mentioned, the most effective target audience for the Schweppes bottled water includes the young and middle aged professional ranging from an age group of 18 to 35 years. The need for targeting the young and middle aged professionals is that most of the India\u2019s population includes young and middle aged people. In addition to this, the emphasis should be on those individuals who use to travel a lot, as they need water on regular basis. Apart from this, the tourists should also be targeted because they also become a major consumer for the bottled water industry in India (Dibb and Simkin 1996).", "Psychographic:\u00a0", "Psychographic aspect is also an important aspect for targeting a specific group of consumers. With respect to bottled water, the important psychographic characteristics that need to be paid attention is the values as exhibited by the younger generation in the country. There are people with certain values and principles and drinking pure and safe water is one such values of their value system. As such, those people should be included in the target market group for the bottled water by Schweppes (Dibb and Simkin 1996).", "Geographic:\u00a0", "The consideration of geographic aspects is also very essential while selecting a target market for a particular group. In case of large countries such as India, it is not feasible to consider the whole country as the target market for a particular product. As such, the selection of a specific target market is essential for considering the plan of expansion. In case of Schweppes, the most important areas that need to be included in the target market group at the initial phase should be the four metropolitan cities of the country. The success of the product in these states of the country would be considered for the further expansion of products in the other parts of the country (Weinstein 2004).", "Benefits:\u00a0", "This is another important criterion in the process of segmenting the target market. This type of segmentation on the basis of benefits indicates that the product should be segmented on the basis of benefits that if offers to the final consumer. As the bottled water is basically for the creation of freshness among the target consumers, its benefit could better be availed by those people who use to travel a lot and often faces with the problem of thirsty. Bottled water could be used in order to create a more pleasure and refreshing environment for those who are faced with such a problem (Dibb and Simkin 1996).", "The selection of a most appropriate marketing mix strategy is essential for Schweppes in order to achieve success in the Indian bottled water market. For the multinational enterprises, international growth is a key objective. There are various kinds of challenges that are to be faced by companies who want to operate their business across national boundaries. These challenges are in the form of performing a complete set of new tasks, different people from across the world etc. In order to achieve success in the international market, a suitable marketing mix is very much essential. The company needs to decide the marketing mix strategy that would be best for the company. It can be standardization of the product offering or the company can decide on differentiation in order to outperform its competitors from the market. The marketing mix related decision of Schweppes with respect to the bottled water operations in Indian market should consider the product, price, place and promotion related aspects (Haberer 2010). The best possible strategy that should be followed by the company is discussed as follows:", "All these marketing activities would be quite helpful to provide a good base to the company to market its new product with greater efficiency. These marketing activities would position the bottled water product in the potential market in such a way that it would attain greater success at its introductory phase of the product life cycle and there by occupies the major percentage of the entire bottled water industry in India.", "The marketing mix strategies need to be implemented in a procedural manner so that the maximum advantage can be availed from such strategy.

In respect to Virgin Australia, an analysis indicates that the main customer group of Virgin Australia includes business and corporate customers, customers from abroad especially the US and general Australian people at large. The core aspect to Virgin Australia that has contributed towards higher level of growth is the focus of the airline towards providing cheaper air travelling services, as it operates in the low cost model.

There has been higher level of competition between the two major airlines especially Virgin Australia and Qantas Airline as they are competing against each other with a view to acquire higher market share. Virgin Australia in particular has recently performed modifications to its business model by adding extra services in its low cost model and there are changes with respect to uniform and other physical evidences being carried out.

There are certain major production processes that have to be carried out for the purpose of delivering the products and services to customers. As a result, the major factors of production that are considered in respect to delivering Virgin Airline\u2019s services in the form of fixed and variable cost of production are analysed as follows:", "Fixed Factor of Production:\u00a0", "The services as offered by Virgin Australia to its customers imply that it is mainly the transportation services whereby people select the airline in order to travel from one destination to another. The delivery of such services is being ensured by Virgin Australia by following through certain major fixed and variable factors of production. The major fixed factor of production that has been noted in respect to the successful delivery of services to customers include the cost borne by the company in purchasing aircraft since it is a one time cost. Another major fixed factor of production that is identified in respect to the efficient service delivery by Virgin Australia to its customers is the airport operating charges that the airline has to face. In efficiently performing the airline services, the airline operators are required to pay the airport charges to the authorities. This cost is also fixed in nature and airline have to incur this cost even if it does not fly is aircraft. In running the aircrafts, the taxes to government on the services as offered to customers is also fixed in nature that have to be paid by the airline by way of collecting them from their customers. These are the major fixed factors of production that have been noted in respect to Virgin Australia\u2019s successfully delivery of services to its customers (Virgin Australia, 2014).", "Variable Factor of Production:\u00a0", "In addition to the fixed factors of production, the airline operation is also supposed to incur variable costs in ensuring its successful performance. Variable costs are the one that varies with the quantity of products or services delivered to customers. An analysis with respect to Virgin Australia indicates that the airline also incurs significant variable cost in the process of successfully delivering services to its customers. The variable factor in the process of delivering service is mainly the oil charges, as this charge is mainly decided by the distance as selected for travelling purposes. The longer distance would mean higher fuel charges, and vice versa. Thus, in case, if a flight does not operate on a particular day, there would not be any fuel cost and this suggests that the cost of fuel is variable and it occurs with the delivery of services as performed by airline. The analysis of Virgin Australia\u2019s services implies that the airline operates on low cost model and it has recently considered the delivery of foods and refreshment on-board to its passengers that wish to buy them. This is also a major variable cost in the delivery of services to customers because the cost of such products and services has to be borne when the customer avails such services (Virgin Australia, 2014).", "Thus, the analysis above indicated about the fixed and variable factors of production that Virgin Airline has to incur in providing its low cost air travelling services. The factors of production as assessed in respect to Virgin Australia has indicated that the cost structure of the firm is partly fixed and partly variable in nature. As for instance, there are certain major fixed costs as well as variable costs that have to be borne by the airline in the process of delivering cost efficient services to its customers. However, the fixed cost occupies the larger share of the entire total cost in delivering services and this is mainly because the airline operating charges including the cost of airline itself is massive and this leads to higher fixed cost share in the total cost of the firm.", "An analysis of the macro environment conditions is also crucial from the point of view of performing a critical analysis of the Virgin Airline\u2019s operation. As a result, the focus of analysis in this section is mainly towards the external environment conditions that is affecting the performance of Virgin Australia. The international operations of Virgin Australia indicates that the airline is operating across different major destinations throughout the globe, but for the purpose of analysing the external market environment, the specific market that has been considered is mainly the Indian markets.

The current performance levels suggest that the economic factors are favourable to the overall performance of Virgin Airline and they would further contribute in a positive manner as evident from the discussion below:", "The sustainability practices that are being followed by Virgin Australia in performing its operations are briefly analysed in this section of the report. The important areas of discussion are performed as follows:", "In respect to ensuring the efficient performance level of Virgin Australia, it is essential that the airline should focus towards higher level of sustainable performance levels in order to operate in a successful manner. The sustainable performance level at Virgin Australia can be positively ensured in the form of utilising fuel efficient aircrafts in its operations, disposing of aircrafts that have become old and considering the purchases of new ones, and also participating in activities that ensures societal development.

The analysis of the macro environmental condition has been performed in respect to Virgin Australia and it is analysed that the economic factors affecting the performance of the airline are positive. Such conditions especially in respect to Indian market are evaluated because Virgin has its operations across India.

There has also been the evaluation of the sustainable performance of Virgin Australia has been performed and it is analysed that the sustainable measures are essential for the purpose of achieving effectiveness in the entire industry performance.

At Procter and Gamble there is very tolerance for illegal or unethical behavior and this defines about the appropriate decisions which are made in every sphere of business. The scope of this article is associated with discussion about the policies of Procter and Gamble with which they are managing to survive in this competitive global business environment. There are several international frameworks making use of which they are leading other FMCG companies and have proved out to be exemplary in nature (Worrell1998).", "The globalized world is a great example in which the physical boundaries have become obsolete and people are consuming not what is available to them but what is preferable to them. This change has led to various critical issues and it is not only business related responsibility but a moral responsibility for each and every multinational company to address these responsibilities and Procter and Gamble has proved out quite competent in this case. The globalized world is a beautiful exemplification in which the consumers of various tastes and preferences are coexisting with each other as there are specialized products and services by companies to address their individual needs (Dhyani 2009).", "The international frameworks for examining the policies used by Procter and Gamble reflect the reasons for which the company has attained success. The very basic framework to be discussed in this case is the PESTEL framework. There is no second thought about the difficulty the company has faced over a period of time in which they have not realized political, legal, economic, social or any other forms of differences while international expansion. In spite of this harsh reality the role and scope of success which Procter and Gamble has attained cannot be denied. This is only because of the underlying inclination towards innovation. The company has always believed in innovation and this has helped in managing with the role of strategies which will be discussed later (Porter 2004).", "This can be truly stated in line with the think global and act local approach followed by the company that innovation has long been the backbone is growth.

Extensive level of research and development activities is carried out on part of the company in its developmental process which assumes out to be the cost of as much as $2 billion. Other aspect which has helped Procter and Gamble to attain such position in the globalized world is the amount of $400 million spent on foundational consumer research. This is done in order to identify opportunities for innovation in nearly 100 countries (Bartlett 2003).", "There are several theories of international trade which can be seen in line with the global crisis of year 2000 faced by Procter and Gamble.

The national wealth according to the mercantile theory or in case of our concerned organization Procter and Gamble, the wealth was diminishing as the accumulated amount was declining at a faster rate. This was the result of year 2000\u2019s downturn. The role of this theory can be justified that it motivates for accumulation of wealth by creating trade surplus. The company fell in line with this theory and expanded its global activities and made move into various nations where the potential was untapped (Treat, Thibault and Asin 1996).", "The other theories to be discussed in this case are absolute advantage theory, comparative advantage theory, factor proportions trade and international product cycle. The most relevant and obvious theory which has proved out beneficial for Procter and Gamble is the international product cycle theory. In this theory it is believed that as the rate of maturity of the product increases there is need for obvious change in the sales as well as the location of the sale. This fact is again equally important for nations as well as with our concerned organization (Porter 1998).", "When the company was faced with leadership crisis in the year 2000 this theory became functional and several changes were carried out. The CEO was changed and the key strategic decisions were also changed in lined with this top level major change. This indicates that the role of all such theories have proved out crucial for the development of Procter and Gamble. Next in line with this discussion the upcoming point is associated with strategy formulation related with various aspects such as risk and organization structure. There is complete history about the evolution of organization structure of Procter and Gamble. Earlier when the structure was evolved it was divisional in nature and then it was transformed into standalone subsidiaries as there was much of international expansion over a period of time (Comai and Tena 2007).", "All these changes were a result of strategic planning with regard to international expansion and this has helped in management of company reputation over a period of time. The other aspects in which the growth and polices of Procter and Gamble are to be appreciated is risk. As far as risk is concerned the organization has a high risk aversion tendency as they believe in routine pattern of success which they have visualized in the US markets.

The risk can only be reflected into various ways such as cost cutting, new product development as well as research and development (Bivial 2008).", "There are calculated risks and high degree risks which have been taken at the very right time to deal with the falling share prices as well as the innovative products introduced in the name of company every now and then. These risks have helped the company to gain stability over a period of time and become successful too. There are ways in which the strategies in relation with the risk taking capabilities of the company can be justified (Middleton 2003).", "In line with Porters five forces analysis it can be truly justified that there is need for matching up with the level of other big companies. The role of Porters five force analysis is much important as it helps in dealing with all the crucial aspects of any company. The five distinct elements which are given importance in this analysis are competition level in the market place, threat from the new entrants, threat from the suppliers, bargaining power of the consumers and last but not the least threat from the substitute products. The threat from the substitute products is too high in case of Procter and Gamble as there are several options available with the consumers.", "In this global world the consumers are very high on information seeking as they need maximum value for their money. They want to manage with all the varied products available to them and their loyalty towards nay particular company or product will change accordingly. To mange with this threat both at the domestic as well as international level the concerned company is making serious efforts. The second aspect in the Porters five forces model of much importance is the threat from the new entrants and as it is evident that the industry of fast moving consumer goods is much volatile in nature there are several new entrants on regular basis.", "A very obvious fact to be mentioned at this point of time indicates that there is need for marinating the status quo as this is an established company over many years. The image so build in the eyes of the consumers is much profound and new entries are not much relevant as a threat in this case. The other aspects in the Porters five forces model are also dealt much carefully in case of the company and it can be concluded that the policies meant for international business are profound in nature.", "The role of international frameworks of business are much important in analyzing the actual situation of nay company and this suggests that multinationals have evolved these fundamental rule over a period of time. The mechanisms which are essential will work only when applied in a global context. All those multinational companies which tend to follow the approach of think global and act global will survive in the long run. This suggests that there is need for following a multidisciplinary approach with which success can be achieved at a faster rate.", "The concerned came of multinational company Procter and Gamble is an eye opener as how the company dealt with its leadership crisis in the year 2000 and came out with flying colors in the international arena. The various theories of international trade have also been applicable in this case and there is need for continuous improvement in order to maintain this position. The role of such prospective details is essential when examination of international policies followed by a giant like Procter and Gamble is carried out and hence it can be concluded that the company excels its closest competitor just because of this commitment towards quality and innovation.", "Table of Contents", "Disclaimer: The reference paper provided by Australian Assignment Help should be used as a model paper, and are not intended to be submitted to the universities.

The management of operations is essential in respect to every organization because it is the operational effectiveness that allows the organization in efficiently meeting out the requirements of their customers. There are various important areas that are included within the operations management in respect to an organization, and supply chain management is one such important area. Supply chain management as the name suggests is concerned with the management of flow of materials to the organization and their distribution to the final consumers after they are being processed to finished products. It is highly essential that the products must be reached to the final consumers on time. But the increasing complexities in the business processes because of higher level of globalization as pursued by them have resulted into higher difficulties in managing the supply chain process (Ballou, 2009).", "There are various parties that are involved in the supply chain management process of an organization, and the efficient flow of information is essential from the point of view of managing the supply chain process in a highly efficient manner.

The company operates at the international level, and it has its operations in majority parts of the world. This report initially discussed in brief about the organization and this is followed by performing an analysis of the supply chain management of the company through reviewing the approach to material management as undertaken at McDonald. The role of relationships to supply chain management would be assessed, and finally, the role played by emerging technologies in the process of successfully managing the supply chain function in the concerned organization would be assessed. Based on the findings, it would be summarized in the conclusion section of this report.", "An analysis of McDonald Corporation indicates that it is a fast food retail chain store based in US. It is a multinational corporation that operates across all corners of the world, and it is known as world\u2019s largest chain of hamburger fast food restaurants. It accounts for serving 68 million customers on daily basis across 119 countries with more than 35000 outlets. The company is known for its hamburgers that are offered to its customers, and apart from this, there are various other offerings made to the customers including French fries, burger, soft drinks and many more. The franchise mode of business expansion strategy that has been considered by McDonald, and this mode have allowed the business in achieving significant level of growth and recognition across international markets. As McDonald is operating at such a larger level, the management of supply chain function is crucial to the organization in efficiently meeting out the needs and requirements for fast foods items of its customers. The requirements for large number of company\u2019s customers are met by highly efficient supply chain function that is managed by the company. The next section discusses about different important elements related to supply chain of McDonald (McDonald, 2014).", "One of the key factors in respect to performing the management of supply chain function is mainly the material management. There are various kinds of materials needed depending on the nature of the organization with regard to the products and services delivered to its customers. An analysis of the case of McDonald indicates that the company is mainly indulged into delivering fast food products to its customers, and this requires the management of large range of materials needed in the production process. The major products that are included within the company\u2019s offerings include burgers, sandwiches, breakfast, salads, beverages, McCafe, desserts and shakes etc. In providing these items, the company has a significant approach to material management. As for instance, an analysis of the case of McDonald indicates that the major requirements for its materials are met out through major distribution centers that are being operated across central locations. Each such distribution center is responsible for meeting out the material requirements of 250 to 700 restaurants. As a result, McDonald branches are not required to stock up the material, rather they are being distributed to them through the distribution centers (Cohen and Lee, 2011).", "However, these distribution centers across different countries are also not owned by the company rather they are being managed by the distribution partners of the company with whom company has informal relations. These distribution partners account for meeting out the material requirements of the company which are then processed at the McDonald restaurants and they are being served as ready for consumption to the final consumers. This implies that McDonald does not own any factories or distribution centers, and the material management is therefore performed by these distribution centers which are being operated by the distribution partners of the company. This has been an efficient material management approach that has been followed at McDonald, and it is complete based on the informal relations with the suppliers i.e. distribution partners of the company. This approach to material management has been highly effective to the company in efficiently meeting out the requirements of its customers. A critical analysis of the supply chain function as followed by McDonald would indicate about the material management that has been carried out by the company.", "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Structure of Supply Chain at McDonald:\u00a0", "This section of analysis is now concerned with analyzing the structure that has actually been followed at McDonald in performing the management of its supply chain function. An analysis of the supply chain of McDonald indicates that the core suppliers of the company can be categorized into two major types including tier 1 suppliers and tier 2 suppliers. In respect to tier 1 category, there are suppliers that provide processed products such as potato, vegetable, chicken, hashbrowns etc. The tier 2 comprises of suppliers that are mainly growers and processors such as potato, poultry items, chicken etc. Both these suppliers accounts for meeting out the requirement for materials in respect to McDonald. These supplier accounts for providing needed materials to the company in serving its customers. The materials are being shipped through logistics services providers to the distribution centers. Upon requirements for such materials at restaurants, they are being ordered to the distribution centers which lead to their transportation via logistics management systems across the company. There is a fleet of refrigerated trucks that accounts for supplying fresh materials in the form of processed foods items to the company\u2019s distribution centers. There are multi-temperature trucks that account for providing the delivery of all kinds of products to the restaurants. The processed foods as delivered to the company are then processed finally for their consumption by the final consumers through McDonald outlet. This is the entire supply chain structure that is prevalent in respect to the operations of McDonald across majority of the countries across the globe. This structure of supply chain is evident from the diagram as indicated below.(Source: McDonald Supply Chain, 2014).", "The structure of supply chain at McDonald above indicates the inclusion of two tier suppliers who transports the products to the centralized distribution centers and they are then transported to McDonald outlet via transportation and tracking mechanism. In these ways, the management of supply chain is ensured at McDonald with a view to achieving timely delivery of finished products to final consumers. In this process, the centralized management accounts for managing the distribution centers but they are not owned by the company as well. Although the supply chain management above indicates about the process that is being followed in performing its management, yet an analysis of McDonald indicates that this supply chain is not applicable in respect to all the materials that are required by the company. As for instance, materials such as buns and coke are being transported to the retail outlets directly by the suppliers.", "Approach to Intermediaries:\u00a0", "The role of intermediaries is crucial in respect to performing the efficient management of supply chain function in an organization. The intermediaries in the form of logistics management companies, distribution centers, suppliers etc accounts for playing a significant role in timely meeting out the needs and requirements of its customers. Intermediaries are mainly the third parties that account for meeting out the needs of two trading parties through providing intermediation services. As in respect to McDonald supply chain, the role of intermediary is played by the suppliers that undertake the responsibility of delivering the materials needed to McDonald restaurants by way of operating their own distribution centers.", "An analysis of the approach of McDonald towards its intermediary i.e. the distribution partner implies that the company has maintained informal relations with their distribution partners. The approach of McDonald restaurant has been positive towards their distribution partners and this positive approach is the resulting factor of timely delivery of products and services across McDonald stores across the globe. Although these distribution centers are not owned by the company, rather they are being operated through the application of strong distribution partners. However, the approach in managing them as utilized by the McDonald company implies that there has been complete control being ensured by centralized McDonald operations over the distribution centers that accounts for meeting out the requirements of large number of McDonald restaurants. The administration is mainly aimed at achieving efficiency with respect to the performance of distribution centers so that the customer requirements on timely basis, and also in fresh quality can be met efficiently (Arntzen, Brown, Harrison and Trafton, 2008).", "This approach to managing distribution centers is aimed at achieving warehouse efficiency, efficient truck utilization etc. In the entire management process, the role of company is minimal with respect to managing materials, as this is completely managed by the distribution centers of the company. The approach of the centralized operations of McDonald is mainly to monitor and control the functioning of distribution centers so that timely meet out of organizational needs with regard to materials can be achieved, and the final consumer can ultimately be served with best quality products and services. This approach to material management is highly efficient because it proves to be successful for McDonald in satisfying their customers efficiently. An important factor in their approach to managing the distribution centers is that McDonald require them to not only warehouse the supplies efficiently, but their transportation is also performed through refrigerated trucks that maintains requisite level of temperature that suited best to such processed foods.", "This approach to the intermediary has been quite successful from the point of view of efficiently carrying out the operations by McDonalds.", "From the point of view of achieving competitive advantage, the material management process as carried out by the company has been highly effective. This is evident from the fact that material management is completely entrusted to third parties and it leads to higher level of effectiveness on the part of organization in focusing mainly towards its core services of providing high quality fast food items. Further, the management of materials for the entire outlets in an economy is being entrusted to a few of the distribution centers, and this allows for achieving economies of scale in the process. An analysis above indicates that each distribution centers account for meeting out the requirements for processed materials for 250 to 750 outlets of McDonalds.", "This implies that a single distribution center has the responsibility of meeting out the requirements of large number of outlets, and this ultimately allows for achieving economies of scale in the process. This provides competitiveness to McDonald in receiving its requirement for material at minimal cost, and thereby, it allows the restaurant in meeting out its customers\u2019 requirements at cheaper rates for its products and services. Further, the management of supplies as entrusted to a single distribution partner results into higher level of commitment on their part in maintaining smooth relationships, and they thereby focuses towards achieving efficiency with respect to their roles and responsibilities in timely and efficiently meeting out the requirements of retail outlets of McDonalds. All these aspects ultimately account for achieving competitive advantage within the company\u2019s operations.", "Overall, the analysis of the material management approach of McDonald above indicated that the company has a specific process that is aimed at meeting out the needs and requirements of all its McDonald outlets in an economy through an efficient distribution process handled by its distribution partners. It allows for timely meeting out the needs and requirements of all the McDonald retail outlets, and thereby in achieving competitiveness throughout the process.", "The supply chain management of an organization involves large number of parties in the process including the suppliers, logistics management companies, distribution handling, and the retailers. An efficient management of relationships with these parties is crucial from the point of view of meeting out the customer requirements on timely basis. The importance of efficient supply chain management is identified from the fact that modern day customers are highly demanding in nature and they expects timely and good quality services from the service providers. With regard to organizations such as McDonalds that accounts for delivering fast food items to its customers, the role of supply chain management is crucial. This is mainly because the products that are being transported to the McDonald outlets are highly perishable in nature, and as a result, a higher overall effectiveness needs to be accomplished in the process. This can be ensured through efficient management of relations across different parties as involved within the supply chain process.", "As in respect to McDonald, the role of relationship management is significantly higher in respect to its material management process that is being carried out. The analysis above indicated that the material management has been carried out by way of distribution partners appointed across countries, and they are entrusted with the responsibility of meeting out the material requirement of all the outlets of the company that are operational within the economy. A single distribution partner is entrusted with the responsibility of meeting out the requirements for material for large number of McDonald outlets operating across a region. As for example, McDonald\u2019s largest distribution partner i.e. Martin-Brower Company LLC accounts for meeting out the material requirements across 15000 locations in North America. Each distribution center as run by Martin Brower Company LLC is accounts for handling 250 to 700 restaurants and they aims at providing warehousing, transportation and logistics services to each unit (What are the Ingredients in a McDonald\u2019s Supply Chain, 2014).", "Similar is the case of McDonald in respect to its operations in India which shows that the company has a distribution partner known as Radhakrishna Foodland Pvt Ltd and it account for handling four major distribution centers across four different corners of the company such as Noida, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata. These distribution centers account for meeting out the requirements of all the McDonald outlets across the entire economy. As the McDonald operations indicate about the maintenance of a single distribution partner in managing the distribution of large number of its franchisees, it is highly essential that there is strong relationship that is prevalent with its distribution partner. This is mainly because the management of such retail operations at large level can be ensured through the application smooth relationships with all the parties associated with its business.", "As in respect to the case of McDonald, an in-depth analysis about the company\u2019s operations indicates that it aims at maintaining stronger relationships within its distribution partners. However, an important factor in respect to the approach of McDonald in managing the distribution partner is mainly in respect to relationships, as there is no such contractual agreement that exists between McDonald and its distribution partners. The relationship is based on informal relations between McDonald and its distribution partners. However, the approach of managing the distribution partners by McDonald indicates that the company exerts sufficient level of control on its distribution partner in terms of meeting out its standards of cold, clean and on-time delivery to its customers. This implies that even though the supply chain management process in being managed by the organization through third party vendor, it still exerts control over their management. All this has been possible because of the existence of informal relations between McDonald and its distribution partners (Cohen and Lee, 2011).", "Any items that are required by the company are directly sourced from the distribution center. In managing its relations with its suppliers, McDonald has no legally documented service level agreement with its distribution partners or even with suppliers. There are certain important key performance indicators that are set up by the company in managing its distribution partners. The most important factors that are considered for the purpose of evaluating the relations with its suppliers or distribution partners are administration efficiency, warehouse efficiency, total number of cases managed per man hour, number of cases handled per trip, truck utilization, and many more. Based on these factors, the evaluation of the distribution partner of the company is performed by the company (Boyer and Verma, 2009).", "The ability of the company in exercising sufficient level of control over the distribution centers is mainly because of the fact that the distribution centers of the company are entrusted with higher responsibility in terms of meeting out the requirements of all the franchisees operating across a major region. As the responsibility has been significantly larger in meeting out the needs and requirements of McDonald retail chain stores, this provides the company with necessary authority to affect the performance level of its distribution centers by interrupting them in their process. Thus, there is the existence of informal relationship between McDonald and its distribution partners, and it is mainly this informal relation that allows the company in putting sufficient level of control over its distribution centers.", "It is mainly the impact of informal relations within the distributors that McDonald ensures the efficient and timely delivery of materials at its stores. The distributors are required to observe various such factors that allow McDonald restaurants in providing quality food on timely basis to its customers. As for instance, the distribution partners are aimed at performing the refrigerated movement of products at different temperatures suited to particular category of products and services. In addition to this, the activities such as demand forecasting are also required to be carried out in a highly efficient manner at McDonald because the distribution partner is required to manage the lead time and other factors to ensure continuity with respect to the retail operations of the company. Apart from this, the aspects of food safety along with quality assurance are other moral responsibilities on the distribution partner of the company. Thus, the entire supply chain management with partners of McDonald is based on the informal agreement with them (Cohen and Lee, 2011).", "Thus, on the basis of analysis of the entire supply chain function of McDonald, it has been evaluated that the role of relationship is significantly higher because the entire supplies to such a stronger network of McDonald franchise systems is being managed through its distribution partners.", "This section of analysis is focused towards examining the role of emerging technologies in performing the management of supply chain function within organization. With the increasing advancement as achieved in the field of technology, the implication of highly advanced and emerging technological systems is higher in respect to businesses. In performing the management of supply chain, there are emerging technologies that are applied by businesses in the process. The application of technology in performing the management of supply chain is also evident in respect to the case of McDonald whereby the company applies highly emerging technological systems in ensuring that they have sufficient level of stocks in meeting up the needs and requirements of its customers. The entire supply chain of the company is powered with highly efficient technological systems so as to make the process as highly smooth and effortless (Collier and Evans, 2009).", "The important of technological systems is also realized by management at McDonald and this leads to the higher overall application of such systems being performed by it in managing the entire operations of the company at the international level. An analysis of the case of McDonald\u2019s supply chain especially in respect to India, it is assessed that there are specific technological systems and software that are being utilized by the company in managing its supply chain function. Suppliers of McDonald make use of SAP technological platform whereas the distribution company applies RAMCO Marshall ERP with Cobra Software. The application of this software in the supply chain process is performed with a view to automize the upload of store orders (Sharma, 2014). The store orders as uploaded over the systems allows the distribution centers in identifying the requirements across different McDonald units and this is turn allows for meeting out the requirements of the organization on timely basis.", "Although the application of technology is performed in respect to managing the supply chain function of McDonald, yet an analysis indicates that there are difficulties being faced by the company in performing the successful integration of technology in its supply chain function. This is mainly because the management of the branches of McDonalds is performed by franchisee and its management is completely undertaken by them which limit the application of technology in the process. This is mainly because of complete management is within the hands of the franchisee and they limits the application of technological systems. As per the information technology director of McDonald\u2019s global supply chain Robert Bauer, it is difficult to them in getting information about the franchisee performance because of lack of adequate information system support on their performance. An analysis of the entire supply chain of the company indicates that it is outsourced completely ranging from hamburger to French fries that are being prepared and delivered to customers.", "As each and every item as prepared in mainly received through the outsourcing process, it is highly essential that there should be complete support of technological systems in performing the management of its requirements. Since few distribution centers account for meeting out the requirements of large number of franchisee, it is essential that their requirements should be well supported over information systems. In this context, it has been evaluated that McDonald also performs the ordering of its requirements to the distribution centers over the technological systems and this allows for timely replenishment of the stock needed in meeting out the requirements of customers.", "Thus, the application of technology is performed at McDonald with a view to achieve higher level of effectiveness in meeting out its requirements for inventory. The emerging technologies in the form of SAP system and ERP systems are being applied for the purpose of managing the supply chain function at McDonald.", "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Technology in Material Planning and Systems Development:\u00a0", "There are various important information systems that are being applied in performing the management of operations at McDonalds which in turn allows for managing the supply chain function in a positive manner. The role of technology is the organization\u2019s management process can be identified from the fact that it makes use of management information system which allows for efficient decision making process within the organization in terms of stock replenishment, order performing to distribution centers, providing managers with information in taking timely decisions etc. The application of management information systems is therefore highly crucial from the point of view of performing the planning with respect to the materials required in managing organization\u2019s processes (McDonald Information Systems, 2014).", "Apart from this particular system, the system development is also ensured at McDonalds in the form of transaction processing systems. There are significant level of transactions that are being carried out in performing the management of operations at McDonalds and this is being positively ensured by way of applying technological systems aimed at management operations. The transactions as recorded over the systems allows for the identification of inventory levels across the franchisee, and their orders are placed based on the lead time that is required by the distribution centers. In these ways, the management of the supply chain function is being positively ensured by way of applying different important systems in performing the management of company\u2019s operations.", "Overall, systems development and the application of information systems is being positively ensured by the company in meeting the requirements of its operations in an efficient manner and thereby in achieving higher level of effectiveness with respect to managing its operations in a positive manner.", "Conclusion", "In this report, a critical assessment has been carried out in respect to the supply chain management as carried out at McDonald. The analysis indicated that supply chain is an important function in an organization and it is mainly concerned with meeting out the needs and requirements of its customers in an efficient manner. The application of supply chain is performed in respect to every kind of organizations in meeting out the requirements of their customers in a positive manner. This is also applied in the context of McDonalds as assessed from a critical analysis that has been carried out in this report. Based on the performance of analysis, it is assessed that the approach to material management has been highly flexible at McDonald which allows for efficiently backing up necessary requirements in meeting out the customers\u2019 need. The structure of supply chain as reviewed has resulted into identification that the McDonald has specific distribution centers across all the economy, and few such distribution centers are responsible for meeting out the material requirements of the company. They performs the warehousing, logistics management etc on behalf of the franchisee and these materials are then distributed to the franchisee based on their requirements.", "In performing the management of materials, McDonald ensures efficient relationship management with the intermediaries especially the distribution centers. A positive relationship enables the management in achieving higher level of efficiency in achieving timely delivery of products which in turn enables the management of customer\u2019s demand in a highly efficient manner. The contractual agreement as assessed in respect to McDonald with its distribution partner indicated that there is no such contractual agreement that actually persists within them, and the management of the entire delivery process is being ensured based on informal relationships with its distribution partner. The analysis also indicated about the implication of technological systems in performing the management of operations of the company, and based on the analysis, it is evaluated that there has been the application of emerging technological systems that have been carried out by the management in performing the efficient management of requirements at different franchisee of the company.", "Table of Contents", "Disclaimer: The reference paper provided by Australian Assignment Help should be used as a model paper, and are not intended to be submitted to the universities.

In its manufacturing process, the company uses the latest information technology systems in order to gain sustainable competitive advantage. With the help of new information system based technology, the company has gained successful position in the dynamic business environment. The business of Nestle in Australia is also very flourishing since many decades. In Australia the company serves customers through a network of sales agents. The company does follow advanced technology means in order to adapt newer technology in its research and development process. In this context, the following research mainly aims to explore existing status of information system/technology implications in Australian business environment. In this report, Porter Competitive Forces Model has been used as a strategic model in order to audit the information management system of Nestle in Australia. The report has also provided some ways through which the company can gain improved competitive advantage in Australian business environment in long run.", "Nestle took decision to set up its business in Australia in the year 1908, when it became the second largest export market of Nestle in the year 1906. In this way Nestle initiated its local production in Australian market (Nestle Australia and UK, 2014). In order to understand the business conditions of Australian market, Nestle operates its business in Australia through having collaboration with nutrition department of the Australian Institute of Sports.", "In Australian business market, Nestle has keen focus on using present information technology means in order to exploit long term business opportunities. In addition to this, with the help of using information technology means the company has made its operations smooth and has increased its sales through improving its efficiency of packaging and other operational functions. Nestle has gained several new technological capabilities with the use of information management system. The use of the new information management technologies has been for several new business initiatives such as making the new products more innovative through renovating them by the ideas adopted from other company information available on internet. In order to do consumer centred innovation, the company has used advanced information from information technology means to make its strategy flourish worldwide. In order to advertise consume related information, Nestle takes help of its website (Nestle: Full Privacy Policy, 2014).", "Nestle has made a privacy policy in Australia under which the personal information collected from the customers is kept confidential. The main issue that is faced by the company in the use of the personal information is that it has to follow the rules of privacy policy in a strict manner. This issue is also faced by the company while operating through its social networking sites. When the company has to take information of the customers from the third parties, it has to follow the business customer credit applications within the premise of information technology means. In the distribution process of Nestle followed in Australia there are more than 5 lacs of suppliers and thus the suppliers\u2019 information database of the company has become too messy that is complicated for the company to manage (Gooderham and Gr\u00f8ogaard 2013). In order to deal with these issues the company is focusing on improvement of the quality of data and has been taking significant steps towards this process. The company has also been overhauling its information technology system with the application of new software such as SAP. In this way, strategic changes have been made in the company through effective means.", "Management information system pursued by a business organisation can be considered as one of the major measure of achieving some intensive amount of success in the long term perspective. In the context of Nestle Australia also, the role and significance of the system can be justified. For the purpose of revelling viability of existing Management Information system employed by the company, Porter\u2019s five competitive force model can be taken into consideration. In regard to this model, the viability of existing system can be revealed with the help of five different crucial competitive forces. For Nestle Australia the auditing of the existing Management Information system can be presented in terms of Porter\u2019s five forces Model.", "Bargaining power of customers", "Bargaining Power of customers in Australia can be considered quite high as there is a high degree of competition prevailing in the industry. The taste and preferences of Australian customers keeps on changing on frequent basis. In this way, in the market bargaining power of customers for the company can be considered quite high. For the purpose of satisfying well diversified needs of customers in Australian market, the company requires frequent changes in the product and service offerings in the most frequent manner so that it can be able to match the preferences of customer (Gooderham and Gr\u00f8ogaard 2013). In regard to this force of the market, the existing level of Management Information System installed in the organization is not quite adequate as it is not so advanced and up to date that it can provide point to point information in the most detailed manner (Nestle: Full Privacy Policy 2014).", "Bargaining Power of Suppliers", "High bargaining power of suppliers of raw material can also be regarded as one of the most critical features of the market of Australia for Nestle. The country operates in the global market with more than 555000 suppliers. In the Australian market also, the company is having a large pool of suppliers. Earlier, the prime issue faced by the company is related with the integration of different suppliers across the globes. In this regard, the existing database of the company was not quite effective. About 9 million records of vendors and suppliers of the company were become corrupted and obsolete (Gooderham and Gr\u00f8ogaard 2013). However, in existing period of time, the company has started to manage its supplier base with the help of newly installed SAP software (Knolmayer et al 2009).", "Threat of New Entrants", "From the perspective new entrants also, the market of Australia can be considered quite challenging for Nestle. In the country, the entry barriers for the industry are not quite high which provides a significant amount of threats for the company. In regard to this threat, the IT system of the company requires more improvement. Frequent entry of new entrants can be considered quite problematic for the company as new companies bring new technologies with them. For the purpose of countering new technological system of new entrant, business organization requires frequent updation and advancement of the system. In this regard, the existing system of the company is not effective enough that can be able to update itself automatically (Gooderham and Gr\u00f8ogaard 2013). Owing to this reason, the company requires to undertake some modification in its existing system.", "Threat of substitutes", "High availability of substitute products of Nestle can also be recognised as one of the crucial competitive force for the company that can affect the viability and profitability of the product in the Australian market. In order to counter this threat, it is essential for the management to have comprehensive information related to the entire marketplace. In context to this requirement, there is a need of highly responsive and integrated Management Information system that can be regarded as means of collecting information other industries and its products also so that information regarding substitute can be revealed. In direction to this, existing MIS of the company also requires some integrity with other related products and industry so that comprehensive views to the management can be delivered (Knolmayer et al 2009).", "Competitive Rivalry", "The last but not the least competitive force for the company in the Australian market as per Porter\u2019s competitive force model is competitive rivalry. In the Australian market, high degree of competition can also be considered as the prime feature of the country for the company. There are different crucial competitors operating in the market of Australia, which are making business activities tough for the company. In this regard, the existing Management Information System pursued by the company should be effective enough to trance activities of competitive firms in the market and suggest the most suitable action and strategy for the company. Recently the company has added SAP software in existing IT framework, which helps the company to maintain effective records of its close competitors (Knolmayer et al 2009). This can be regarded as one of the most crucial opportunities for the company with its new MIS.", "In this way, it can be understood that there are some positive and negative aspects of MIS installed by the company for the purpose of operating in Australian marketplace.", "With the application of the new means of management information system, the firms like Nestle can gain strategic as well as competitive advantage in long run.

With the inclusion of new information system means the company can improve its operational functions and even can save billions of amounts on annual basis (Papp, 2001). The information technology means can provide the company a strong information base by using which the company can integrate its business information. In addition to this, the new information management system can be used by the company to improvise its advertising and sales promotion activities in a significant manner.", "On the basis of the discussion made in the paper, it can be concluded that management information system can be considered as an important requirements for the long term success of the organisation. Effective MIS helps the company to collect some crucial information from the marketplace and use them in the most effective manner. Adequate, timely and effective information about internal and external business environment helps the company to take some effective and impactful decisions in the favour of the company. This competence serves as an intensive competitive advantage for the company. In this regard to this, presented paper has audited existing MIS installed by Nestle Australia for taking decisions and undertaking planning in the market place. As per the results of this auditing done in terms of Porter\u2019s competitive forces, it can be reflected that in the context of managing complex relationship with suppliers and countering competitive rivalry, the existing position of MIS of Nestle can be considered quite effective and potential.

An analysis of the case of Woolworths indicate that the sourcing strategy as adopted by the company is aimed at achieving sustainable performance conditions whereby the company adapts local food sourcing strategy in order to ensure development and growth of local firms. This strategy of locally sourcing food is aimed at supporting the local producers and its purchasing process also indicates that it supports sustainable development.

There are some specific featured of the Dell\u2019s operational strategies which makes it an important dominant player in the entire computer industry. The case analysis revealed that the most crucial strategy as pursued by Dell is that of direct selling strategy, whereby Dell performs direct selling of its computers and other IT related products to its final consumers. This direct selling strategy has proved to be highly beneficial to Dell in the sense that it allowed the company in not only identifying the needs and requirements of its final consumers, but it also helped the company in customising the products so that higher level of satisfaction to the final consumer can be achieved (Berman, 2007).", "Further, this strategy of direct sales model has also allowed Dell in achieving efficiency in other operational areas, as the company can effectively perform the demand forecasting and thereby accurate volume of production of computers can become possible to organisation that needs to be produced to meet customer demands. This has allowed the attainment of cost effectiveness to Dell, as it is not required to stock inventory in abundance. The ability of the company to forecast demand has allowed it in applying the philosophy of Just-In-Time (JIT) and the ultimate effect of such philosophy is higher operational efficiency. There is a higher need for companies to achieve cost effectiveness in their operations in order to survive in this highly competitive business environment. The cost efficiency would allow them in effectively meeting their customer requirements and this is what Dell has focused in its operation which allowed it to become the most significant seller of computers across the industry (Morden, 2007).", "The analysis of the case of Dell further revealed that its core strategy also includes the mass customisation. The 21", "st", "\u00a0century business environment is mostly affected by the customers, as companies are required to pay adequate attention towards their customer likings, preferences and demand. Dell has adequately considered this point and it is quite effectively reflected in its mass customisation strategy whereby the company manufactures products and services addressing its customer requirements. Another important aspect of the operational strategy of Dell is that it builds strong relationships with its suppliers rather then integrating them within its existing operation. This is also regarded as a significant strategy of the company, as this has allowed it in making the most efficient purchases of its requirements in manufacturing computers. In addition to this, the feasibility of the Dell\u2019s direct selling model, its ability to customise products and services, applying JIT philosophy and providing highly personalised services to customer have become possible because of its rigorous sharing of information with suppliers and customers (Scott, Lundgren and Thompson, 2011).", "On the basis of evaluation as performed with respect to the important operational strategies as pursued by Dell, I have identified that the strategies are mostly aimed at achieving operational efficiency by the organisation. This has allowed Dell in transferring that effectiveness to final consumers in terms of timely meeting their demands as per the requirements and the ultimate effect is evident over its performance within the industry. Further, in my opinion, there is a significant need for the businesses to identify possible ways through which they can achieve cost efficiency in performing their operational activities. This is because, the consumers are highly price conscious and they look for higher value as against the money they pay for buying products. Dell has effectively realised this and it has considered for JIT philosophy which allows it in immediately meeting the customer demands without necessitating it to store inventory for longer duration.", "In my opinion, although the company has achieved operational effectiveness, but this strategy of JIT also allowed it in effectively responding to customer requirements on time. This is because since the company did not store too much of inventory, so the introduction of new technology or product has also allowed the company in becoming the first to launch it into the market and as a result, it gains the benefit of first mover advantage. This indicates that all the major operational strategies as pursued by Dell are highly effective, as they all are inter-related and this allowed the company in achieving the most dominant position across the entire computing industry.", "IT Complexities in the Process of Product Design:", "\u00a0This case study mainly describes about the complexities that the IT poses to the successful design of the products and services by companies in the 21", "st", "\u00a0century business environment. The rapid development as identified in the field of technology has necessitated companies to introduce highly advanced and new technology within their products and this has made it extremely difficult for them to utilise the most effective technological tool in performing the design of their products. Technology is evident in respect to all kinds of products that are available in the market today, and at the same time, companies are regularly involved in the process of making the most advanced products by designing new additional features within their existing line of products. This has created significant problems to them in maintaining the cost of producing such products amidst such fast changing technological environment (Reiner and Schaper, 2010).", "The advancement in technology has resulted into the application of wide range of technical tools in performing the design of products. Further, the diverse requirements on the part of customers has necessitated businesses to customise their products and services as per their requirements, and this has often put challenges on the development teams to realise the poor product architecture designs. The ultimate effect of such poor architectural designs is significant losses to the company in both the financial terms as well as to their reputation. Another major significant problem as identified within the case study in the process of designing products is that weak linkage with the business priorities. The tech-enabled products are no way contributing towards the overall accomplishment of the business strategy or they have conflicts within the existing business strategies of the organisation. The success in the designing of products can therefore be attained by way of considering technical aspects in the process (Reiner and Schaper, 2010).", "Improving Product Designing by Integrating IT in the Process:\u00a0", "The task of product designing can be improved significantly through effective integration of IT in the process of design. The technical initiatives on the part of companies are highly essential in order to achieve success within their existing processes of product design. Another major significant factor in the process of successful design of products is that the managers responsible for designing the products through considering the IT systems should be technical experts. This is because, the rapid development in the IT systems has made it complex situation for the non technical managers to even understand the features that needs to be considered in the performing the designing of the products. Hence, the case study indicates that the successful designing process of products requires sound technical manager that have the expertise in better understanding the technical terms and applying them in the product designing process (Reiner and Schaper, 2010).", "The higher value in the process of designing the products can be accomplished by way of performing an alignment of the business goals with that of the engineering goals. A proper alignment is crucial towards the success of product design because it would help in making the most effective application of technology. In addition to this, the better designing of products can also be accomplished by way of achieving higher level of transparency across various organisational functions including IT, marketing, engineering and other product functions. This is mainly because, the transparency would allow the effective collaboration between all of them, as marketing department can provide important inputs in terms of customer requirements and preferences and this would allow the engineering department in incorporating the needs of the customers in the product design process. The resulting impact would be better overall design of the products by way of integrating the latest IT systems (Stewart, 2008).", "The role of sound architecture is also identified as crucial in the product designing process. It becomes essential to focus on the subset of different architectures in order to ensure the designing process to be most efficient. A proper architecture allows for the better integration of software and hardware and the ultimate impact is better overall designing of the product. In addition to this, an integrated management approach is also needed in order to perform the development of tech-enabled products. The business as well as the technical teams needs to have a right focused approach from the beginning so that the overall process of designing the products by way of integrating the most relevant technology can be performed in a manner that ensures higher level of performance of the entire product (Reiner and Schaper, 2010).", "Table of Contents", "Disclaimer: The reference paper provided by Australian Assignment Help should be used as a model paper, and are not intended to be submitted to the universities.

The case of Enron is an important case of corporate fraud that explains the accounting frauds that have bee carried out in the books of accounts. These fraudulent practices have resulted into the collapse of Enron and have raised significant level of questions. There are various parties that are directly involved in the failure of Enron and they have contributed in a significant manner. This case analysis is therefore aimed at analysing different aspects of the Enron case initially. As for instance, there would be an analysis of the role played by the corporate culture in Enron\u2019s bankruptcy and this is followed by an analysis of the role played by different important stakeholders of the firms in the demise of Enron\u2019s collapse (Ferrell and Fraedrich, 2014). Apart from this, the analysis in this report also includes an assessment of the concept of whistleblower and the form and extent of current institutionalised whistleblower protection in Australia. The analysis is also focused towards evaluating the effectiveness of Australian whistleblower in achieving protection and this would be analysed through the application of relevant case examples. The findings from the entire analysis would then be summarised in the conclusion section of the report.", "The role of corporate culture is significant in respect to the performance of an organisation, as the corporate culture as prevalent across the organisation guides the actions and behaviour of employees working within it. The case analysis of Enron indicates that it has been a major corporate collapse in the corporate history, and an important factor that has contributed significantly towards the collapse of Enron is mainly the corporate culture as prevalent across it. An analysis of the cultural conditions as prevalent across Enron indicates that the organisation has a culture of arrogance whereby employees have the belief that they can handle greater level of pressure without facing any kinds of danger. It is mainly the corporate culture of an organisation that has to promote integrity within employees and promote the values of respect to each other in the organisation. However, in respect to the given case of Enron, its corporate culture has failed to promote the values of respect and integrity and this has contributed in an adverse manner towards the collapse of the entire organisation (Salehi and Rostami, 2009).", "For a corporate culture to be highly efficient, it is essential that the values of integrity and respect should be highly promoted. However, in respect to Enron, these important aspects were ignored completely, as there has been a decentralised structure being followed which allowed the top level managerial people in easily indulging into frauds in the books of accounts of the company. In addition to this, there are certain major areas that seemed to have undermined the corporate culture values at Enron and these are mainly the employee performance appraisals within the organisation and the compensation program. The decentralised organisational structure has been a major contributory factor towards such easy involvement of the top management in the fraudulent practices. This organisational structure has resulted into each of the major division at Enron being kept separate from others, and this led to very few people aware about the big perspective with regard to company\u2019s operations. Such lack of operational and financial controls has allowed the top management to indulge into fraudulent practices with the firm\u2019s auditor Arthur Andersen.", "In addition to this, the compensation plan that has been devised across Enron was focused towards benefitting the senior level executives rather than enhancing the profitability for the shareholders. This has resulted into adequate level of power and authority within the members at top management in breaking rules and inflating the earnings of the company. The application of non-standard accounting practices have been possible at Enron because of the bonus program which allows for inflating the earnings in the books as well. The ineffectiveness of the corporate culture at Enron is also identified from the fact that when the fraud has become widespread, the top managerial executives have started creating partnerships in order to hide losses. This indicates the loopholes in the corporate culture of Enron, as the top level executives were not feared about revealing their fraudulent activities, and they have started involving other members with a view to perform frauds further within the organisation (Healy and Palepu, 2003).", "The analysis above indicates that the corporate culture has been significant at Enron in contributing towards its failure, as it has allowed the top management in taking actions themselves without involving other employees or members from the organisation. In order to function in an efficient manner, it is essential that there should be close co-ordination that should be encouraged within employees, and managers and employees should be promoted to perform discussion on the major organisational activities. This implies that the employees should be provided with necessary authorities to question their managers in case when they feel that anything wrong has been carried out across organisation. But these aspects were lacking in respect to the corporate culture that has been followed across Enron. The coordination between the lower level employees and senior executives was lacking and there were no one to question the activities of senior level executives. This has provided them with necessary opportunities in indulging within fraudulent activities and finally, corporate fraud has been accounted in the form of misstatements in the books of accounts of the company.", "The unethical decisions and actions were mainly promoted by the corporate culture that was prevalent across Enron. The role of senior management is highly important in respect to ensuring the fact those businesses activities are carried out in an ethical way. The policies and procedures are mainly implemented by the senior level management in an organisation, and it is therefore essential that they should behave in an ethical manner. In order to ensure that higher overall ethical values within organisation, it is essential that the senior level managers should contribute their maximum overall efforts and encourage the lower level staff to follow ethics with respect to their decisions and actions. However, the case analysis of Enron indicated that the management itself engaged in unethical practices, and as a result, there is nothing to expect from lower level of employees within organisation. The performance of such unethical practices by managerial level people at Enron clarifies that the corporate culture lack sufficient integrity in fostering right business practices within the managerial level people, and as such, the organisation ultimately has to face the collapse as a result of it (Marx and Els, 2010).", "The analysis above therefore clearly indicates that the role of corporate culture has been significant at Enron in fostering towards the situation of bankruptcy.", "The stakeholders of an organisation have a significant role to play in the overall performance of an organisation. The stakeholders are mainly those parties that have a direct level of impact from the performance of an organisation. Some stakeholders have the potential to impact the performance level of an organisation in a significant way. An analysis of the given case of Enron\u2019s demise indicate that it is affected by large number of stakeholders that have a played a direct role in its collapse. The specific parties such as bankers, auditors, and attorneys are directly associated with the performance of Enron, and the case analysis in detail indicated that these parties have played an active role in the process of demise of Enron. The ways in which they have played an active role in the process are analysed as follows:", "The banker has facilitated towards the failure of Enron and this is mainly identified from the fact that the banker of Enron i.e. Merrill Lynch has allowed Enron in selling Nigerian Barges. This has therefore allowed the Enron in making a record of $12 millions in earnings, and this has ultimately resulted into the better possibility to the company in meeting out its earning goals at the end of 1999. This has been a major way in which banker has contributed towards the Enron demise, as it allowed Enron in performing frauds in its financial statements in terms of manipulating its income statement. This is done in the form of entering a deal which indicated that Enron would buy Merrill Lynch\u2019s investments in 6 months period with a guaranteed 15% rate of return. This deal has been accepted by Merrill Lynch despite knowing that the transaction allows Enron in performing fraudulent manipulation of its income statement. Merrill Lynch was also faced allegations with respect to replacement of a research analyst after the coverage of Enron as performed which displeased Enron executives. All these aspects give an indication of the fact that there has been an active involvement of Merrill Lynch in the corporate fraud that has been carried out at Enron. Despite an active role of Merrill Lynch in the fraud at performed at Enron, it indicated that it did nothing improper in Enron business dealings (Levine, 2012).", "Apart from the active role of banker, the auditors of Enron i.e. Arthur Anderson also played a crucial role in the demise of Enron. The auditor of a firm is mainly responsible for checking the books of accounts with a view to ensuring accuracy and authenticity of the matters as present in it. They are required to identify any errors as existence within the financial statement of the company. But in respect to the given case of Arthur Anderson, the auditing firm seems to have not performed its responsibility in an ethical manner. The case analysis of the failure of Enron indicated that there has been active role being played by Arthur Anderson in the fraudulent activities that were carried out in its books of accounts. It is essential that the auditing firm should act in an independent manner, because there are various important stakeholders of the organisation that directly makes use of the opinion as provided by the auditors. But the analysis of the Andersen in respect to Enron indicates that it has not acted in an independent manner, and there are some executives of Andersen that have accepted jobs from Enron. Andersen also failed to ask Enron in explaining its complex partnerships before certifying the financial statements. All these acts of Andersen indicate that it has contributed towards Enron\u2019s demise (Sikka, 2009).", "The Attorneys have also played a critical role in the demise of Enron. The attorneys in respect to Enron i.e. Vinson and Elkins have played a crucial role in helping Enron in structuring some of the special purpose partnerships. The legality of such deals has been supported by the firm and Vinson and Elkins acts as a great facilitator in supporting these deals through transaction opinion letters. These deals have played a contributing role in the demise of Enron. Thus, the analysis indicates that bankers, auditors and attorneys played a crucial role in the demise of Enron. Although these stakeholders have been identified as the major contributor towards the demise of Enron, yet an analysis in detailed indicates that they were not in a position in questioning the senior executives at Enron. This is mainly because of some senior officials holding the major authority that have entered into corporate frauds. This was unethical because as being the auditor of the firm, Arthur Andersen have the requisite authority as well as the right to examine the books of accounts in detail. But they failed to do so partly because of their own interest in the firm.", "On the basis of analysis, it is believed that they have adopted the same unquestioning attitude to Enron\u2019s accounting because of their personal interest involved in it. The case analysis of the auditing firm Arthur Andersen indicates that they are prohibited from carrying out any audit because their active involvement in the Enron\u2019s fraudulent practices has been identified. This indicates the personal interest of these stakeholders and also their lower overall authority in questioning the matters at Enron has resulted into their adaptation of such unquestioning attitude.", "In order to analyse the form and extent of current institutionalised whistleblower protection in Australia, it is essential to initially analysed the concept of Whistleblower. Whistleblower is an important concept that indicates the protection of an organisation from any corrupt practices or fraudulent practices by way of disclosing the information in the interest of the public. A whistleblower is mainly a person that is responsible for exposing the misconduct that is taking place in an organisation. Any kinds of alleged activities, dishonest or legal activities that are taking place in an organisation are being disclosed with a view to ensure that they do not have a major impact on the performance level of the organisation (Dawson, 2000).", "An analysis of the whistle blowing practices in Australia indicates that this concept has been given higher level of importance because it is mainly intended to ensure the protection of corporate from any major kinds of fraudulent practices. In respect to the form and extent of institutionalising whistle blowing practices in Australia, an analysis indicates that there are certain important forms of whistle blowing practices that have been adapted by most of the Australian states so as to eliminate improper and unlawful conduct. The protection of whistle blowers in Australia is performed under certain forms of legislations including the criminal or civil liability, dismissal or breach of confidentiality and there has been confidentiality being maintained with respect to their identity (Australian Security and Investment Corporation, 2014).", "As indicated above, there are different forms of whistle blowing protection legislations that are there across different major states in Australia. As for instance, the major ones include the South Australian Whistleblower Protection Act 1993, The NSW Protected Disclosure Act 1994, the Queensland Whistleblower Protection Act 1994, the Act Public Interest Disclosure Act 1994, Official Corruption Commission Act 1988 and many more. This indicates that there are different important forms of Whistle blowing acts that are aimed at ensuring the protection from corrupt or fraud practices within workplace. However, an important aspect that has been noted with regard to the extent to which they ensures protection is that majority of these Acts are aimed at ensuring the protection of public officials and companies at large. Even though their aim is to ensure the protection of whistleblowers in Australian public companies, these legislations sometime fails to ensure the complete protection of whistleblowers (Dawson, 2000).", "Apart from the different forms of whistleblowers institutionalised in Australia currently, an important area of analysis is mainly the extent to which they are being institutionalised. As far as the extent to which these different forms of whistle blowing practices are being deployed, an analysis of the existing literature indicates that there adaptation has been lacking in certain major states across Australia. As for example, a study as conducted in respect to 800 public sector employees in NSW in order to analyse the awareness of mechanism for reporting corruption, and the findings of the study indicated that two third of the employees surveyed said that they had not heard of the Protected Disclosures Act. This indicates the extent of institutionalising of whistleblower protection has not that been effective, as the employees that are claimed to be protected are not aware of such legislation. This signifies the loopholes of the legislations that are being introduced for the protection of Whistleblowers (Dawson, 2000).", "The analysis above indicates that there are various important legislations that are existent in order to ensure the protection of whistle blowers. These legislations as enacted are mainly aimed at protecting the whistle blowers from the disclosures as made by them with regard to the corrupt practices at workplace. However, the main question is mainly with regard to the effectiveness of these legislations in ensuring the protection of whistleblowers. Even though there are legislated protections for Whistleblowers for their protections, but an analysis of their current conditions in respect to US indicates that it is not highly efficient. The whistleblowers have to face significant level of personal difficulties as a result of disclosing fraudulent practices on the part of their top management. The personal price of disclosing wrong doing has been devastating to whistleblowers across US despite having protective legislations aimed at ensuring their protection. As a result, the effectiveness of these legislations for the protection of whistleblowers is highly in question (Cohan, 2014).", "The case analysis above with respect to the form of whistleblower protection in Australia revealed that there are various such legislations, but an analysis of the effectiveness of these protections across Australia implies that they are not that effective. This is identified from the case example at NSW whereby a study indicated that the employees are not aware of the legislative measures that are being adapted in their organisation for their protection. In addition to this, the case analysis in the context of Australia implies that there are possibilities of performing the manipulation of the whistle blowing legislation or they can be used as a device for further damage or control. This signifies that there can be the personal usage of such legislations that are being enacted for the purpose of protection of employees. This has therefore been the major weakness with regard to the effectiveness of these legislations in ensuring the protection of whistle blowers (Australian Security and Investment Corporation, 2014).", "The case analysis of the legislations as available for the protection of whistleblowers in Australia implies that it has historically been weak in ensuring the complete protection of whistleblowers. The legislations are not that effective which in turn leads to cost to be borne by the whistleblowers. As for instance, in respect to the Australian conditions, it has been well established that the whistleblowers have to face the cost for making any disclosures of corrupt or fraudulent practices of others. They have to face with the personal attacks from those to whom they have exposed and sometimes, they are being threatened by the government themselves. The often faces the problems of losing their jobs because of disclosures as made by them, and they are sometimes prosecuted as well. The current laws and legislations in protecting whistleblowers indicate that there has been higher overall costs that whistleblower have to faced from making disclosures of the fraudulent practices by their management. All these aspects give a clear indication of the fact that the legislations for the protection of whistleblower across Australia have not that been effective. Instead of providing protection, the whistleblowers are to face with adverse situation from disclosing any frauds within their organisation (Democracy in Australia- Protection of Whistleblowers, 2013).", "Overall, the analysis above indicated about the different important forms of legislations that are there for whistleblowers and they claims that they are effective enough in ensuring the protection of whistleblowers. But the analysis of the case in the context of Australia indicates that these legislations are not that effective from the point of view of ensuring the actual protection of employees, rather it is evaluated that they causes further problems to the whistleblowers that have made an attempt of disclosing unacceptable information at the workplace.", "This report involved a critical analysis of the case of Enron initially which is followed by an analysis of the forms and effectiveness of the whistle blowing practices that have been carried out across Australia. The case analysis of Enron as performed initially has indicated that it is mainly the corporate culture at Enron that has contributed positively towards the demise of the entire organisation. The corporate culture at Enron has not that been effective from the point of view of promoting integrity and this has therefore contributed towards its failure. The analysis indicated that the lack of critical questioning of the accounting practices have contributed in an adverse manner towards the failure of the entire organisation. The case analysis with respect to Enron as performed above has also indicated that the important stakeholders of the organisation such as bankers, auditors, and attorneys have positively contributed towards the demise of the organisation. Their involvement in the process has supported top management at Enron in performing the fraudulent practices in a positive manner.", "Apart from the case analysis of Enron, the whistle blowing legislations and their form and extent to which they are being deployed across Australia has been analysed and the performance of analysis indicated that there are various important forms of whistle blowing legislations that are being deployed across Australia for the purpose of ensuring the protection of whistleblowers. These are mainly in terms of South Australian Whistleblower Protection Act 1993, The NSW Protected Disclosure Act 1994, the Queensland Whistleblower Protection Act 1994, the Act Public Interest Disclosure Act 1994, Official Corruption Commission Act 1988 and many more. Although these whistle blowing legislations are being enacted for the purpose of achieving protection of the whistleblowers, yet the case analysis in the context of Australian economy indicated that these legislations are not that effective from the point of view of performing the protection of whistleblowers across the economy. This similar situation has also been identified in respect to US economy, as the legislations as applied are not effective in ensuring the protection of whistleblowers.", "Table of Contents", "Disclaimer: The reference paper provided by Australian Assignment Help should be used as a model paper, and are not intended to be submitted to the universities.

As for instance, it has been identified that the mobile communication has completely replaced the landline mode of communication in case of Australian mobile market. The introduction of highly technological mobile phones such as iPhone has further allowed the Australia people to consider the mobile phones in performing communication over the landlines. Email, SMS and instant messaging services as provided with the mobile phones have also significantly contributed towards the replacement of landline phones from the entire mobile market. Another major contributing factor towards the decline of landline is the price-capped mobile phone plans as provided by the major Australia mobile phone companies such as Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and Virgin. The findings from the analysis of mobile phone market also revealed that competition among the existing players is significantly higher and as such, they distinguishes themselves by undertaking initiatives in the form of providing bundle of benefits to customers and by undertaking brand management which is highly visible in the areas of sponsorship and community involvement. The findings from the analysis also revealed that networks, service providers, retailers and call plans are the major determining factor of success of mobile phone operators within the country. The findings suggest that the entire mobile phone market in Australia is dominated by Telstra which is followed by Optus occupying the second position.

The report begins with a discussion on the growth in the mobile market in Australia by highlighting the significance of mobile phone communication over the landline communication and the ways in which the landline phones have disappeared from the telecommunication industry within the Australian economy. The reasons leading to the adoption of mobile phones over the landline are indicated and the various service providers of mobile phone services are analysed in brief. As for instance, the Australian mobile phone market is mainly dominated by four largest players including Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and Virgin Mobile. An analysis of the various service offering by these mobile providers would allow for a complete analysis about the Australian mobile market. The mobile plans with specific calling rates as provided by these mobile service providers become the core areas of discussion within the given report.

The selection of an appropriate target market is essential so that it can be launched into the market with appropriate strategies that would lead to higher acceptance of the product by the targeted consumers. With respect of iPhone 4S, the target audience of the company includes mid tier consumers, as the company aims at targeting a large volume of customers instead of few higher end consumers. In order to ensure that the product is acceptable to wider customer database, it has made every possible attempt to keep the pricing of its iPhone 4S within the reach of middle class consumers (Apple iPhone 4S pricing designed to widen its appeal, 2011). Apart from this, the target market for iPhone 4S also includes the customers of previous versions of iPhone who wish to upgrade their iPhone to iPhone 4S (Smartphone wars: iPhone 4S vs. Droid RAZR, 2011).", "Product Type and Marketing Mix Implication:\u00a0", "iPhone 4S is a mobile phone device that is primarily designed for allowing consumers to establish communication with others and also to perform a wide range of functions including connecting with internet, sharing their thoughts and knowledge through social networking, storing images etc. It is a mobile phone that serves the purpose of allowing communication to its users with others. The marketing mix implication for mobile phone product is essential as the mobile phone companies are required to develop all the elements of marketing mix strategies such as product strategy, pricing strategy, promotion strategy etc. The success of mobile phones depends upon the effectiveness with which it is being priced and launched in the market. This indicates a greater implication of marketing mix strategies for mobile phones industry (Sandhusen, 2008).", "Positioning Strategy used for the Product:\u00a0", "The positioning strategy for a product implies the creation of desirable and distinctive position in the minds of consumers so that a higher acceptability for the product can be achieved on the part of consumers (Sengupta, 2005).

As a result, the positioning of iPhone 4S is mostly done as the most innovative mobile phone that presents a wide range of features to its customers.

There are various promotional strategies that can be adopted in order to ensure that the most effective promotion of the product is being performed and the target customers are fully made aware of all the features associated with it (Odugbemi, 2008). With respect to Apple Inc, it has also used a number of promotional tools in order to communicate the features of its product to market. As for instance, the company has promoted its iPhone 4S through its own website by including detailed features offered in its iPhone 4S. Apart from this, Apple iPhone 4S is also promoted by way of TV commercials as well whereby company communicates the headline feature of its iPhone 4S-siri and also promoted about its siri in displaying musical notes to the users (Morris, 2012).", "A copy of the television advertisement used to communicate with the target audience is given below:", "The above mentioned TV advertisement by Apple Inc in order to communicate with its target customers and to promote its iPhone 4S can be accessible at:", "Advantages and Disadvantages of using this Promotional Tool:\u00a0", "There are certain advantages as well as disadvantages of using TV commercial in order to promote its iPhone 4S. As for instance, the most important advantage to Apple Inc from using TV commercial in promoting its iPhone 4S is that it can reach a wider target audience in a most effective manner. Further, television makes use of a wide range of effects to communicate the product features such as sound, print, video, still photos, motions etc in order to attract the attention of potential consumers. However, the disadvantage of using TV commercials is that it cannot be solely used to ensure that the product has been promoted among its entire target audience. For instance, the working people often have less time to watch TV and majority of the people switches to different channels during advertisements. As a result of this, those consumers cannot be considered as having complete knowledge of the product offered by the company (Shimp, 2008).", "The promotion through TV ads suits highly in promoting Apple\u2019s iPhone because through TV commercials, the attention of most of the customers can be drawn and as the commercial ads by the company explains the features available to users from iPhone, it can be regarded as a most effective promotional tool.

This can only be attained through developing an effective pricing strategy for the product depending upon the needs and budget of its target customers. As identified, the company aims at targeting the middle end and higher end consumers for its Apple iPhone 4S and as a result, the pricing objective for the product has been to keep it reasonable for middle end consumers to buy the product. The strategy that has been used for the iPhone 4S is to set different prices for different its different capacities of 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB models. As for instance, the prices of Apple iPhone 4S having capacity of 16 GB is US $199, for 32 GB is US $299 and for 64 GB it is US $399 (Apple Inc, 2012).

As a result, the features included in iPhone 4S will become less relevant as most the consumers would prefer to buy the latest versions of iPhone. However, with respect to prices of other phones, they are also likely to experience reduction in the prices.", "The assessment of the marketing mix strategies for Apple iPhone 4S has resulted into the identification of certain strength points as well as weak points of its strategy. On the basis of analysis, it can be said that the strategies with respect to pricing and promotion can be further adjusted to achieve higher level of recognition for the product among its targeted consumers. As for instance, the targeting strategies could be made more specific with identifying the specific consumer groups that can be targeted for its iPhone 4S such as business professionals or young people groups that have flair of using high features phones such as iPhone, Samsung Galaxy etc. In addition to this, the pricing strategy can be made more innovative and acceptable to more of its target market segment by keeping it slightly lower as compared to its major competitors such as Samsung and Motorola, and finally, there are a range of promotional tools to make the iPhone highly visible to its target consumers including public relations whereby company can offer discounts, or other offers such as buying iPhone 4S would provide them with additional add-ons with it.", "Conclusion and Recommendation", "A critical analysis of the Apple iPhone 4S has been performed with specific emphasis being placed on the marketing mix strategy adopted by Apple Inc for its latest version of iPhone.

The main task to be performed in this report is related with critical analysis of two main activities of logistics and supply chain management department which are strategic alliances and lean thinking. (Breitman and Lucas 2007).", "For this purpose literature review section will be the next which will explore about the information available in this arena with use of appropriate example. Along with supply chain management it is important to have an idea about the scope of logistics before the critical analysis. There are several definitions again to explain about logistics but the basic definition explains it to be form of science which is related with planning. The scope of planning extends up to the execution of the planned events along with the feedback implementation is the devised action plan as per the performance in each and every field is realized with time.", "The logistics and supply chain management function is very crucial for companies as it is related with the most important activities which are carried out in organizations in light of the most common objective of any company which is perpetual succession. The two main tasks associated with this field, which are strategic alliances and lean thinking, will be the focal point of discussion but some light needs to be thrown on all the tasks which are performed in the scope of logistics and supply chain management department associated with all the organizations. As stated in the introduction part logistics is believed to be a science which relates with planning and execution both and the functions performed can be defined as design and development of the acquisition plan, procurement of the raw materials as per the needs and concerting the raw materials into semi finished then finished goods and ultimately supplying them to the final consumers.", "Logistics are also defined as the management processes which are related with flow of goods and information and on basis of flow that is whether the flow is into the organization or it is out from the organization they are classified into two types. The logistics function is generally categorized under two broad headings which are termed as inbound logistics and outbound logistics. The inbound logistics is related with activities like restoration and procurement activities in the light of propagation of goods and information. While on the other hand the out bound logistics are related with activities like movement of all the materials which are related with storage, shipping and allocation of final goods to the organizational consumers (Cohen and Lee 2011).", "In other words the logistics and supply chain management functions are related with the organizational goods and information from the very first point of beginning and they keep association with the till the very last point of the ending of the whole process. In case of supply chain management the scope of activities is very wide and it covers a huge network in form of logistics. There different activities which are performed in the name of supply chain management are related with tasks like procurement of the raw material (Ballou 2009).", "There is crucial list of managerial decisions which are associated with supply chain management function and the importance of this organizational department can be realized in the light of the fact that it is present in both type of organizations like service industries and the manufacturing industries. Along with the above stated facts it is very important to state that the importance is high for the industries and companies but the complexity involved in the supply chain management process varies from one company to the other.", "The managerial decisions which are to taken in the light of logistics and supply chain management department are related with different organizational levels. The decisions taken can be termed as location decisions, product decisions nd the inventory decisions. Importance associated with all the decisions is very high as these decisions will decide about the efficiency and effectiveness so realized in the performance of activities in the concerned areas. The two separate topics in the supply chain management functions to be discussed here with use of appropriate examples are strategic alliance and lean thinking. Let us first consider about the scope and purpose of strategic alliances in the contemporary competitive business world (Geoffrion and Graves 2009).", "Strategic alliances are believed to be saviors as there are several examples in which they have proved out to be miraculous for survival of companies. In the last two decades the importance and need for such practices has increased greatly because of the trends like globalization, liberalization and privatization of the world economies. In addition with this the increased use of information technology and related activities has lead to more number of strategic alliances being carried out within companies (Vollman, Berry and Whybark 2008).", "As the name itself suggests the strategic alliances are carried out in the light of specific organizational purposes and the association of two companies with each other is planned out in such a manner that it proves out to be beneficial for both these companies in a long run. At times these alliances are not choice of the companies but an option to remain competitive in the global business arena so as to meet up with the consumer\u2019s demands and sustain the cut throat competition pervading in the external world. This reality of strategic alliance exposes the unhealthy side of this lucrative option as to make forced and imposed strategic alliance there are surely certain compromising factors which are to be considered by either of the participating firms which are not as beneficial as they were ought to be (Geoffrion and Powers 2009).", "While on the other hand it is generally stated and believed that the main purpose of such practices is to create knowledge and resource pool with which the available opportunities can be captured in a better manner. There are several types of strategic alliances which are carried out in order to fulfill various organizational purposes like increasing marketing share in the existing market place, making entry into a new market place and also to increase business opportunities.", "To get a clear insight about the scope and function of strategic alliances the definition needs to be considered here. As per the definition strategic alliance is believed to be a form of cooperative management among companies. The aspect of cooperative management is realized among companies which are determined to attain a strategic goal so decided by them in a mutual manner. The strategic alliances are classified into two types and they are based on equity and non equity based strategic alliances (Cooper and Ellram 2003).", "The first category which is equity based is related with sharing of minority stock investments, joint ventures, and the extreme end, majority investments while on the other hand the non equity based strategic alliance can be defined as a contractual arrangement that specifies the responsibilities of both the parties involved in a different manner. The major aspects covered in this category of a strategic alliance are related with organizational expansion or annihilation. Along with all the facts so stated above it is very important to highlight the key feature of any strategic alliance which states that the companies taking part in any such activity will not lose their independency and strategic sovereignty. But at the same time the chance of impact created on their strategic direction as a result of strategic alliance so formulated cannot be rule out altogether (Cohen and\u00a0 Lee 2011).", "There are many industries in which the activities related with strategic alliance have carried out great transformation in both positive and negative aspects and the concept can be better explained in light of a relevant example which explains of the better and worst parts of it. To consider a strategic alliance here let us talk about the great example of Lojack and Micro Logic. Both the companies are operational in the technical field and their association was supposed to be great hit. Lojack was concerned with producing anti theft mechanisms and devices for the cars while the other company in this case is Micro logic which was concerned with production of software updates t match with client\u2019s specifications in a unique manner (Lee and Billington 2012).", "The key perspective of the Micro logic company was to devise such products which were easy to handle and efficient at the same time. In light of a particular strategic approach of individual companies both came together to establish a strategic alliance. The first company Lojack was efficient in case of creative devices while the other company Miocro logic focused on innovation. Both when got associated the focus shifted on establishment of cost leadership in the market place with which they aimed to meet up the consumer needs in the most effective manner (Houlihan 2008).", "The association or the strategic alliance brought about certain strategic changes which were realized by both the involved parties. In case of Lojack the organizational change so carried out can be evidently termed as revolutionary in nature. As from meeting up the customer needs in ordinary manner the focus got shifted on strengthening the sales and marketing effort of the company so that more and more of customer support can be generated. The aftereffects of this strategic alliance can be categorized in both opportunistic manner and the losses which took place. The opportunities which were realized was capturing the greater degree of market share but the same time threat was also there of losing individual identity in the eyes of consumers.", "Apart from strategic alliances the second element of logistics and supply chain management function to be discussed within the scope of this report is lean thinking. Lean thinking is defined to be an advanced manufacturing technique which is associated with best products at a lowest possible price. The approach was initially used and established by famous car manufacturing company Toyota in the time period of 1980\u2019s. The approach followed in case of lean thinking is also termed as lean manufacturing and is associated with delivering best value to the consumers with best price. In the last decade the use and popularity of lean thinking approach has increased in a great deal and much software has been launched in this regard too.", "Lean thinking is believed to be a supreme class mechanism of managing and dealing with the organizational activities in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the companies. Mostly the Japanese and American companies are inclined towards the use of lean thinking and within its scope they have managed to improve their performance and the quality of products they are offering to their consumers (Stenross and Sweet 2011).", "The best manner to explain this approach which is popularly being used in several companies is with use of an appropriate example and what will be best than to explain about Toyota and its practices, which is believed to be original innovator of lean thinking prospects. In case of manufacturing industry and companies like Toyota the lean thinking is also believed to be the process of world class manufacturing or high performance manufacturing. \u00a0It is an evident fact that Japanese automobile manufacturer, Toyota, was the first company to pave way for lean manufacturing and there are certain principals of lean manufacturing. Toyota focuses on the wastage elimination to the maximum possible extent so that the highest degree of productivity can be achieved in turn.", "In case of manufacturing process which is followed at Toyota it is believed that waste is something unnecessary which accounts for hindrance in the process of value addition which is elementary. The value addition process is inclusive of transferring the raw materials into finished goods which are appropriate for consumer use. Customers are believed to be the final and ultimate authority to judge about the value addition process as they are the ultimate users of it. The whole thinking so described above is followed at Toyota and it is defined to be lean thinking.", "In the light of lean thinking there are several benefits which are realized by organizations and these benefits can be termed as improvement in the organization focus towards performance. Along with this the company will also manage to control all the activities which are being carried out in the organizational scope so that a streamlined flow can be maintained among all the essential activities and the waste ones can be eliminated at an increased pace. All the control related activities must be carried out the shop floor level this is the most highlighted principal of lean thinking as all the activities re progressed for there.", "There are certain principals which are agreed upon in concern with implementation of lean thinking in the companies at various levels of functions. The very forte aspect to be stated in this regard is related with the follow up of batch and queue model of operation which accounts for efficiency associated with each and every worker working for the company and the equipments too. In addition with there is one more principal which is inclined towards the one piece flow idea of working. This will save redundancy at various levels and a systematic flow will also account for cost reduction and time allocation (Arntzen, Brown, Harrison, and Trafton 2008).", "One more principal in light of the lean manufacturing adopted at Toyota can be explained in relation with transformation of the entire enterprise on fundamental basis and this will help in the cultural transformation of the organization which is very important to follow a global approach in the contemporary business scenario. There are several services tools which are followed in this context and they can be named as value stream mapping, quick changeover reduction, single minute\u2019s exchange of Dies (SMED), Kaizen, total productive maintenance, Kanban systems and the likes.", "Apart from Toyota now lean thinking is being applied in various activities which are performed in the scope of different companies and these are related with using lesser amount of each and every resource which is available with the company for production. The general principals of lean manufacturing also indicate about the optimization of the productivity concerns.", "There is no scope for wastage and in case of lean thinking defining about the value which will be provided to the consumers has to e defined very precisely. One more aspect to be defined in light of lean thinking talks about three major business activities which are product and service definition, information management and focus on value-creating steps. Along with the above stated points the practice of zero defects is also focused in lean manufacturing (Masters 2010).", "Table of Contents", "Disclaimer: The reference paper provided by Australian Assignment Help should be used as a model paper, and are not intended to be submitted to the universities.

The management of operations is essential in respect to every organization because it is the operational effectiveness that allows the organization in efficiently meeting out the requirements of their customers. There are various important areas that are included within the operations management in respect to an organization, and supply chain management is one such important area. Supply chain management as the name suggests is concerned with the management of flow of materials to the organization and their distribution to the final consumers after they are being processed to finished products. It is highly essential that the products must be reached to the final consumers on time. But the increasing complexities in the business processes because of higher level of globalization as pursued by them have resulted into higher difficulties in managing the supply chain process (Ballou, 2009).", "There are various parties that are involved in the supply chain management process of an organization, and the efficient flow of information is essential from the point of view of managing the supply chain process in a highly efficient manner. Further, with the advancement in the field of technology is achieved, there has been higher overall application of information management systems to perform the management of supply chain process. The application of technology has resulted into the attainment of effectiveness in the process of managing supply chain. In performing the management of supply chain, the important activities that need to be carried out includes material management, and also the management of positive relationships across different important parties as involved within the supply chain of the company. Emerging technologies are also applied in performing the management of supply chain functions in an organization.", "This report is aimed at performing an analysis of the supply chain function of McDonald Corporation which has been a fast food retail chain store based in US. The company operates at the international level, and it has its operations in majority parts of the world. This report initially discussed in brief about the organization and this is followed by performing an analysis of the supply chain management of the company through reviewing the approach to material management as undertaken at McDonald. The role of relationships to supply chain management would be assessed, and finally, the role played by emerging technologies in the process of successfully managing the supply chain function in the concerned organization would be assessed. Based on the findings, it would be summarized in the conclusion section of this report.", "An analysis of McDonald Corporation indicates that it is a fast food retail chain store based in US. It is a multinational corporation that operates across all corners of the world, and it is known as world\u2019s largest chain of hamburger fast food restaurants. It accounts for serving 68 million customers on daily basis across 119 countries with more than 35000 outlets. The company is known for its hamburgers that are offered to its customers, and apart from this, there are various other offerings made to the customers including French fries, burger, soft drinks and many more. The franchise mode of business expansion strategy that has been considered by McDonald, and this mode have allowed the business in achieving significant level of growth and recognition across international markets. As McDonald is operating at such a larger level, the management of supply chain function is crucial to the organization in efficiently meeting out the needs and requirements for fast foods items of its customers. The requirements for large number of company\u2019s customers are met by highly efficient supply chain function that is managed by the company. The next section discusses about different important elements related to supply chain of McDonald (McDonald, 2014).", "One of the key factors in respect to performing the management of supply chain function is mainly the material management. There are various kinds of materials needed depending on the nature of the organization with regard to the products and services delivered to its customers. An analysis of the case of McDonald indicates that the company is mainly indulged into delivering fast food products to its customers, and this requires the management of large range of materials needed in the production process. The major products that are included within the company\u2019s offerings include burgers, sandwiches, breakfast, salads, beverages, McCafe, desserts and shakes etc. In providing these items, the company has a significant approach to material management. As for instance, an analysis of the case of McDonald indicates that the major requirements for its materials are met out through major distribution centers that are being operated across central locations. Each such distribution center is responsible for meeting out the material requirements of 250 to 700 restaurants. As a result, McDonald branches are not required to stock up the material, rather they are being distributed to them through the distribution centers (Cohen and Lee, 2011).", "However, these distribution centers across different countries are also not owned by the company rather they are being managed by the distribution partners of the company with whom company has informal relations. These distribution partners account for meeting out the material requirements of the company which are then processed at the McDonald restaurants and they are being served as ready for consumption to the final consumers. This implies that McDonald does not own any factories or distribution centers, and the material management is therefore performed by these distribution centers which are being operated by the distribution partners of the company. This has been an efficient material management approach that has been followed at McDonald, and it is complete based on the informal relations with the suppliers i.e. distribution partners of the company. This approach to material management has been highly effective to the company in efficiently meeting out the requirements of its customers. A critical analysis of the supply chain function as followed by McDonald would indicate about the material management that has been carried out by the company.", "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Structure of Supply Chain at McDonald:\u00a0", "This section of analysis is now concerned with analyzing the structure that has actually been followed at McDonald in performing the management of its supply chain function. An analysis of the supply chain of McDonald indicates that the core suppliers of the company can be categorized into two major types including tier 1 suppliers and tier 2 suppliers. In respect to tier 1 category, there are suppliers that provide processed products such as potato, vegetable, chicken, hashbrowns etc. The tier 2 comprises of suppliers that are mainly growers and processors such as potato, poultry items, chicken etc. Both these suppliers accounts for meeting out the requirement for materials in respect to McDonald. These supplier accounts for providing needed materials to the company in serving its customers. The materials are being shipped through logistics services providers to the distribution centers. Upon requirements for such materials at restaurants, they are being ordered to the distribution centers which lead to their transportation via logistics management systems across the company. There is a fleet of refrigerated trucks that accounts for supplying fresh materials in the form of processed foods items to the company\u2019s distribution centers. There are multi-temperature trucks that account for providing the delivery of all kinds of products to the restaurants. The processed foods as delivered to the company are then processed finally for their consumption by the final consumers through McDonald outlet. This is the entire supply chain structure that is prevalent in respect to the operations of McDonald across majority of the countries across the globe. This structure of supply chain is evident from the diagram as indicated below:(Source: McDonald Supply Chain, 2014).", "The structure of supply chain at McDonald above indicates the inclusion of two tier suppliers who transports the products to the centralized distribution centers and they are then transported to McDonald outlet via transportation and tracking mechanism. In these ways, the management of supply chain is ensured at McDonald with a view to achieving timely delivery of finished products to final consumers. In this process, the centralized management accounts for managing the distribution centers but they are not owned by the company as well. Although the supply chain management above indicates about the process that is being followed in performing its management, yet an analysis of McDonald indicates that this supply chain is not applicable in respect to all the materials that are required by the company. As for instance, materials such as buns and coke are being transported to the retail outlets directly by the suppliers.", "Approach to Intermediaries:\u00a0", "The role of intermediaries is crucial in respect to performing the efficient management of supply chain function in an organization. The intermediaries in the form of logistics management companies, distribution centers, suppliers etc accounts for playing a significant role in timely meeting out the needs and requirements of its customers. Intermediaries are mainly the third parties that account for meeting out the needs of two trading parties through providing intermediation services. As in respect to McDonald supply chain, the role of intermediary is played by the suppliers that undertake the responsibility of delivering the materials needed to McDonald restaurants by way of operating their own distribution centers.", "An analysis of the approach of McDonald towards its intermediary i.e. the distribution partner implies that the company has maintained informal relations with their distribution partners. The approach of McDonald restaurant has been positive towards their distribution partners and this positive approach is the resulting factor of timely delivery of products and services across McDonald stores across the globe. Although these distribution centers are not owned by the company, rather they are being operated through the application of strong distribution partners. However, the approach in managing them as utilized by the McDonald company implies that there has been complete control being ensured by centralized McDonald operations over the distribution centers that accounts for meeting out the requirements of large number of McDonald restaurants. The administration is mainly aimed at achieving efficiency with respect to the performance of distribution centers so that the customer requirements on timely basis, and also in fresh quality can be met efficiently (Arntzen, Brown, Harrison and Trafton, 2008).", "This approach to managing distribution centers is aimed at achieving warehouse efficiency, efficient truck utilization etc. In the entire management process, the role of company is minimal with respect to managing materials, as this is completely managed by the distribution centers of the company. The approach of the centralized operations of McDonald is mainly to monitor and control the functioning of distribution centers so that timely meet out of organizational needs with regard to materials can be achieved, and the final consumer can ultimately be served with best quality products and services. This approach to material management is highly efficient because it proves to be successful for McDonald in satisfying their customers efficiently. An important factor in their approach to managing the distribution centers is that McDonald require them to not only warehouse the supplies efficiently, but their transportation is also performed through refrigerated trucks that maintains requisite level of temperature that suited best to such processed foods.", "This approach to the intermediary has been quite successful from the point of view of efficiently carrying out the operations by McDonalds.", "From the point of view of achieving competitive advantage, the material management process as carried out by the company has been highly effective. This is evident from the fact that material management is completely entrusted to third parties and it leads to higher level of effectiveness on the part of organization in focusing mainly towards its core services of providing high quality fast food items. Further, the management of materials for the entire outlets in an economy is being entrusted to a few of the distribution centers, and this allows for achieving economies of scale in the process. An analysis above indicates that each distribution centers account for meeting out the requirements for processed materials for 250 to 750 outlets of McDonalds.", "This implies that a single distribution center has the responsibility of meeting out the requirements of large number of outlets, and this ultimately allows for achieving economies of scale in the process. This provides competitiveness to McDonald in receiving its requirement for material at minimal cost, and thereby, it allows the restaurant in meeting out its customers\u2019 requirements at cheaper rates for its products and services. Further, the management of supplies as entrusted to a single distribution partner results into higher level of commitment on their part in maintaining smooth relationships, and they thereby focuses towards achieving efficiency with respect to their roles and responsibilities in timely and efficiently meeting out the requirements of retail outlets of McDonalds. All these aspects ultimately account for achieving competitive advantage within the company\u2019s operations.", "Overall, the analysis of the material management approach of McDonald above indicated that the company has a specific process that is aimed at meeting out the needs and requirements of all its McDonald outlets in an economy through an efficient distribution process handled by its distribution partners. It allows for timely meeting out the needs and requirements of all the McDonald retail outlets, and thereby in achieving competitiveness throughout the process.", "The supply chain management of an organization involves large number of parties in the process including the suppliers, logistics management companies, distribution handling, and the retailers. An efficient management of relationships with these parties is crucial from the point of view of meeting out the customer requirements on timely basis. The importance of efficient supply chain management is identified from the fact that modern day customers are highly demanding in nature and they expects timely and good quality services from the service providers. With regard to organizations such as McDonalds that accounts for delivering fast food items to its customers, the role of supply chain management is crucial. This is mainly because the products that are being transported to the McDonald outlets are highly perishable in nature, and as a result, a higher overall effectiveness needs to be accomplished in the process. This can be ensured through efficient management of relations across different parties as involved within the supply chain process.", "As in respect to McDonald, the role of relationship management is significantly higher in respect to its material management process that is being carried out. The analysis above indicated that the material management has been carried out by way of distribution partners appointed across countries, and they are entrusted with the responsibility of meeting out the material requirement of all the outlets of the company that are operational within the economy. A single distribution partner is entrusted with the responsibility of meeting out the requirements for material for large number of McDonald outlets operating across a region. As for example, McDonald\u2019s largest distribution partner i.e. Martin-Brower Company LLC accounts for meeting out the material requirements across 15000 locations in North America. Each distribution center as run by Martin Brower Company LLC is accounts for handling 250 to 700 restaurants and they aims at providing warehousing, transportation and logistics services to each unit (What are the Ingredients in a McDonald\u2019s Supply Chain, 2014).", "Similar is the case of McDonald in respect to its operations in India which shows that the company has a distribution partner known as Radhakrishna Foodland Pvt Ltd and it account for handling four major distribution centers across four different corners of the company such as Noida, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata. These distribution centers account for meeting out the requirements of all the McDonald outlets across the entire economy. As the McDonald operations indicate about the maintenance of a single distribution partner in managing the distribution of large number of its franchisees, it is highly essential that there is strong relationship that is prevalent with its distribution partner. This is mainly because the management of such retail operations at large level can be ensured through the application smooth relationships with all the parties associated with its business.", "As in respect to the case of McDonald, an in-depth analysis about the company\u2019s operations indicates that it aims at maintaining stronger relationships within its distribution partners. However, an important factor in respect to the approach of McDonald in managing the distribution partner is mainly in respect to relationships, as there is no such contractual agreement that exists between McDonald and its distribution partners. The relationship is based on informal relations between McDonald and its distribution partners. However, the approach of managing the distribution partners by McDonald indicates that the company exerts sufficient level of control on its distribution partner in terms of meeting out its standards of cold, clean and on-time delivery to its customers. This implies that even though the supply chain management process in being managed by the organization through third party vendor, it still exerts control over their management. All this has been possible because of the existence of informal relations between McDonald and its distribution partners (Cohen and Lee, 2011).", "Any items that are required by the company are directly sourced from the distribution center. In managing its relations with its suppliers, McDonald has no legally documented service level agreement with its distribution partners or even with suppliers. There are certain important key performance indicators that are set up by the company in managing its distribution partners. The most important factors that are considered for the purpose of evaluating the relations with its suppliers or distribution partners are administration efficiency, warehouse efficiency, total number of cases managed per man hour, number of cases handled per trip, truck utilization, and many more. Based on these factors, the evaluation of the distribution partner of the company is performed by the company (Boyer and Verma, 2009).", "The ability of the company in exercising sufficient level of control over the distribution centers is mainly because of the fact that the distribution centers of the company are entrusted with higher responsibility in terms of meeting out the requirements of all the franchisees operating across a major region. As the responsibility has been significantly larger in meeting out the needs and requirements of McDonald retail chain stores, this provides the company with necessary authority to affect the performance level of its distribution centers by interrupting them in their process. Thus, there is the existence of informal relationship between McDonald and its distribution partners, and it is mainly this informal relation that allows the company in putting sufficient level of control over its distribution centers.", "It is mainly the impact of informal relations within the distributors that McDonald ensures the efficient and timely delivery of materials at its stores. The distributors are required to observe various such factors that allow McDonald restaurants in providing quality food on timely basis to its customers. As for instance, the distribution partners are aimed at performing the refrigerated movement of products at different temperatures suited to particular category of products and services. In addition to this, the activities such as demand forecasting are also required to be carried out in a highly efficient manner at McDonald because the distribution partner is required to manage the lead time and other factors to ensure continuity with respect to the retail operations of the company. Apart from this, the aspects of food safety along with quality assurance are other moral responsibilities on the distribution partner of the company. Thus, the entire supply chain management with partners of McDonald is based on the informal agreement with them (Cohen and Lee, 2011).", "Thus, on the basis of analysis of the entire supply chain function of McDonald, it has been evaluated that the role of relationship is significantly higher because the entire supplies to such a stronger network of McDonald franchise systems is being managed through its distribution partners.", "This section of analysis is focused towards examining the role of emerging technologies in performing the management of supply chain function within organization. With the increasing advancement as achieved in the field of technology, the implication of highly advanced and emerging technological systems is higher in respect to businesses. In performing the management of supply chain, there are emerging technologies that are applied by businesses in the process. The application of technology in performing the management of supply chain is also evident in respect to the case of McDonald whereby the company applies highly emerging technological systems in ensuring that they have sufficient level of stocks in meeting up the needs and requirements of its customers. The entire supply chain of the company is powered with highly efficient technological systems so as to make the process as highly smooth and effortless (Collier and Evans, 2009).", "The important of technological systems is also realized by management at McDonald and this leads to the higher overall application of such systems being performed by it in managing the entire operations of the company at the international level. An analysis of the case of McDonald\u2019s supply chain especially in respect to India, it is assessed that there are specific technological systems and software that are being utilized by the company in managing its supply chain function. Suppliers of McDonald make use of SAP technological platform whereas the distribution company applies RAMCO Marshall ERP with Cobra Software. The application of this software in the supply chain process is performed with a view to automize the upload of store orders (Sharma, 2014). The store orders as uploaded over the systems allows the distribution centers in identifying the requirements across different McDonald units and this is turn allows for meeting out the requirements of the organization on timely basis.", "Although the application of technology is performed in respect to managing the supply chain function of McDonald, yet an analysis indicates that there are difficulties being faced by the company in performing the successful integration of technology in its supply chain function. This is mainly because the management of the branches of McDonalds is performed by franchisee and its management is completely undertaken by them which limit the application of technology in the process. This is mainly because of complete management is within the hands of the franchisee and they limits the application of technological systems. As per the information technology director of McDonald\u2019s global supply chain Robert Bauer, it is difficult to them in getting information about the franchisee performance because of lack of adequate information system support on their performance. An analysis of the entire supply chain of the company indicates that it is outsourced completely ranging from hamburger to French fries that are being prepared and delivered to customers.", "As each and every item as prepared in mainly received through the outsourcing process, it is highly essential that there should be complete support of technological systems in performing the management of its requirements. Since few distribution centers account for meeting out the requirements of large number of franchisee, it is essential that their requirements should be well supported over information systems. In this context, it has been evaluated that McDonald also performs the ordering of its requirements to the distribution centers over the technological systems and this allows for timely replenishment of the stock needed in meeting out the requirements of customers.", "Thus, the application of technology is performed at McDonald with a view to achieve higher level of effectiveness in meeting out its requirements for inventory. The emerging technologies in the form of SAP system and ERP systems are being applied for the purpose of managing the supply chain function at McDonald.", "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Technology in Material Planning and Systems Development:\u00a0", "There are various important information systems that are being applied in performing the management of operations at McDonalds which in turn allows for managing the supply chain function in a positive manner. The role of technology is the organization\u2019s management process can be identified from the fact that it makes use of management information system which allows for efficient decision making process within the organization in terms of stock replenishment, order performing to distribution centers, providing managers with information in taking timely decisions etc. The application of management information systems is therefore highly crucial from the point of view of performing the planning with respect to the materials required in managing organization\u2019s processes (McDonald Information Systems, 2014).", "Apart from this particular system, the system development is also ensured at McDonalds in the form of transaction processing systems. There are significant level of transactions that are being carried out in performing the management of operations at McDonalds and this is being positively ensured by way of applying technological systems aimed at management operations. The transactions as recorded over the systems allows for the identification of inventory levels across the franchisee, and their orders are placed based on the lead time that is required by the distribution centers. In these ways, the management of the supply chain function is being positively ensured by way of applying different important systems in performing the management of company\u2019s operations.", "Overall, systems development and the application of information systems is being positively ensured by the company in meeting the requirements of its operations in an efficient manner and thereby in achieving higher level of effectiveness with respect to managing its operations in a positive manner.", "In this report, a critical assessment has been carried out in respect to the supply chain management as carried out at McDonald. The analysis indicated that supply chain is an important function in an organization and it is mainly concerned with meeting out the needs and requirements of its customers in an efficient manner. The application of supply chain is performed in respect to every kind of organizations in meeting out the requirements of their customers in a positive manner. This is also applied in the context of McDonalds as assessed from a critical analysis that has been carried out in this report. Based on the performance of analysis, it is assessed that the approach to material management has been highly flexible at McDonald which allows for efficiently backing up necessary requirements in meeting out the customers\u2019 need. The structure of supply chain as reviewed has resulted into identification that the McDonald has specific distribution centers across all the economy, and few such distribution centers are responsible for meeting out the material requirements of the company. They performs the warehousing, logistics management etc on behalf of the franchisee and these materials are then distributed to the franchisee based on their requirements.", "In performing the management of materials, McDonald ensures efficient relationship management with the intermediaries especially the distribution centers. A positive relationship enables the management in achieving higher level of efficiency in achieving timely delivery of products which in turn enables the management of customer\u2019s demand in a highly efficient manner. The contractual agreement as assessed in respect to McDonald with its distribution partner indicated that there is no such contractual agreement that actually persists within them, and the management of the entire delivery process is being ensured based on informal relationships with its distribution partner. The analysis also indicated about the implication of technological systems in performing the management of operations of the company, and based on the analysis, it is evaluated that there has been the application of emerging technological systems that have been carried out by the management in performing the efficient management of requirements at different franchisee of the company.", "Table of Contents", "Disclaimer: The reference paper provided by Australian Assignment Help should be used as a model paper, and are not intended to be submitted to the universities.

Thus, it has been agreed that the management accountant\u2019s role has been extensively changed as compared to the past and they now have to play an active role in the management decision making process.", "There has been a severe debate among the existing scholars about the topic of changes in the role of management accountants. For instance, according to Batra (1998), traditionally, the management accountants were responsible for providing the financial and operating information to the management, but with the changing business environment and the shape of the organization, the expectations from the management accountant have increased significantly and they are being regarded as the integral part of ensuring organization\u2019s success. Due to the changing business environmental conditions, management accountants are responsible for keeping themselves aware of their customers and competitors, of time, flexibility and continuous development (Batra, 1998).", "With the rapid enhancement as achieved in the field of technology, the role of management accountants has been redefined as an analyst whereby they are required to participate in the decision of strategy formulation within the organization, so that the attainment of competitive advantage can be possible. In addition to this, the changing role of management accountants also involves the decision related to the allocation of resources such as finance, technology, processes, people, products etc in order to achieve the determined strategies. The redefined role of management accountant has a direct impact on the operations of the organization as they are likely to contribute towards the management of change in the world of uncertainty, complexity and speed. This implies that management accountant provides an opportunity to the management in effectively understanding the complex business environment and in turn, allows them for better decision making process (Batra, 1998).", "According to Mahony & Doran (2008), the role of management accountants is certainly different, as the newer information system such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) has provided enough time for analyzing the information rather than getting the bottom financial figures. As a result of this, managers are in a better position to make the most effective decisions after performing a critical analysis of the data and ultimately, improved business performance can be attained. Management accountants have the opportunity to influence the business, as they can identify the main drivers of spending and better control can be performed for achieving higher operational efficiency (Mahony & Doran, 2008). In a study conduced by Yazdifar & Tsamenyi (2005), it has been identified that management accountants are required to perform a number of additional tasks in the modern day business environment as compared to the role they used to perform traditionally. For instance, the major task of management accountant includes business performance evaluation, implementing business strategy, profit improvement, planning and managing budget, interpreting management accounts, operational decision making, productivity improvement, managing IT systems and many more (Yazdifar & Tsamenyi, 2005).", "Thus, the analysis indicates that management accountants have a wider role to play in the modern day complex business environment, as compared to their traditional role of providing only the figures to the top management. They even participate in the formulation of strategies of the organization so that the overall effectiveness can be ensured and ultimately, a higher organizational growth can be achieved. However, the changing role of management accountants in the 21", "st", "\u00a0century is fostered by a number of factors including the shift towards a service economy, application of advanced information system such as ERP, just in time management, enterprise risk management, global competition etc. Overall, their role and responsibilities have increased significantly and it ultimately has a positive impact on the business decision making process.", "Cost classification is an important process that involves the grouping of cost on the basis of common characteristics. However, the task of classifying the cost depends upon the purpose for which it has been classified. The task of classifying the cost is highly important because of a number of reasons.

The management of processes within organization is a crucial function of the operation manager, and they determine the overall effectiveness of the operational activities as performed. The effective management of operational processes helps in achieving advantages in the form of cost efficiency, better customized products suiting the needs and priorities of customers, and it also ensures timely delivery of finished products to the final consumers.", "The management of processes can thus be ensured by the operational managers through two different types of processes including job shop and flow shop. The flow show can be defined as a process whereby a manufacturing facility produces one or two similar products through the application of high volume specialized equipments. One of the examples of flow shop is assembly line of production. Contrary to this, the job shop operational process is mainly a manufacturing facility that produces several different products in smaller batches. One such example of job shop is a machine shop. This implies that the core differences between both these processes are in terms of their production levels as flow shop emphasizes on the production of one or two similar facilities whereas the job shop emphasizes on the production of several products in smaller batches (Sarin, 2007).", "In terms of advantages of job shop facility is concerned, it has various advantages in terms of high production mix facility, higher flexibility in performing processes, higher production volume elasticity, low obsolescence and high robustness to machine failure. Its major disadvantages include low capacity utilization and very hard scheduling process because of variability in the production process. Contrary to this, the flow shop has the major advantage of better capacity utilization because there are few types of products being produced that allows for standardization. The major disadvantage with the flow shop is that it is less flexible as compared to the job shop. These advantages and disadvantages of flow shop and job shop are required to be considered by an operational manager in order to make their selection in performing the production processes (Meredith and Shafer, 2009).", "An identification of the important processes of operational management indicates that both the job process and flow process are crucial to an organization. However, the analysis of the case of Klassy Kitchens Pty Ltd indicates that there are various problems faced by the company in relation to the management of its operations. A critical analysis of the case indicates that the problems are identified mainly in relation to the processes that are carried out in meeting the needs of different types of customers. From the case analysis, it has been assessed that the Klassy Kitchens is specialized in providing customer made kitchen cabinets and this is mainly performed through applying a customized approach whereby the individual customer requirements are met for the kitchen cabinets design.", "However, with the increase in sales and the demands for the cabinets, there are several low volume contracts that are signed to supply small spec builders1 with a range of higher quality. As a result of this contract, the Klassy Kitchen was required to manufacture limited range of kitchen cabinets in small batches. This has resulted into a more standardized approach in performing the manufacturing of kitchen cabinets by the company, and this has been regarded as the initiating factor for problems faced by the company in managing its operations. With the demands increases for standardized production of cabinet kitchen, Klassy Kitchen has applied this standard approach to production in its existing production facility. In addition to this, Klassy Kitchen also continues to focus on its customized approach to designing cabinet kitchens as it becomes the core source of revenue to the company, and it also accounts for higher profitability (Greasley, 1999).", "As a result of this two fold approach to satisfying customer requirements, the problems are started creeping into the production processes of Klassy Kitchen. The existing employees are required to pay attention towards both the customers that ask for customized kitchen cabinets and also the customers that ask for standardized cabinets in the form of limited range of kitchen cabinets in the form of small batches. The employees were initially responsible for performing customized design only and with the increase in demands for standardized products, the level of pressure has increased on them and this has affected the performance to a significant level. They need to produce both the customized designs as well as standardized designs in the same factory and this has reasonably increased the level of expectations from them to satisfy the needs of different customers\u2019 types of the company (Bakliwal, 2011).", "Although, the increase in the sales and requirements of customers regarding the kitchen cabinets products has been highly efficient from the point of view of overall performance of the company, yet such increasing demands should be adequately satisfied by the infrastructure and equipments within the company (Nair, 2002). However, an analysis of the case of Klassy Kitchen Pty Ltd indicates that the growth in the sales and demands for kitchen cabinets is neither supported by the infrastructure nor by the equipments installed in the company. Initially, Klassy Kitchens operates in a single manufacturing facility in Cabramatta and it accounts for the manufacturing of both the custom and standard kitchen cabinets. Apart from this, this is accompanied by general purpose machines in producing the wide variety of custom designed cabinets whereas Alcorta (2004) asserts that the specialized processes of the production process in a company should be adequately supported by the specialized equipments.", "The lack of supportive equipments in allowing the company in performing the standardized production of kitchen cabinets is therefore another major problem that was faced by Klassy Kitchen in its production process. In addition to this, the analysis of the flow process and job shop process above indicates that these processes to production differ significantly between each other and as such, combining them would pose significant threats to an organization. As per Bell (2005), the equipments utilized in producing products according to different processes should not be grouped together and they should be kept separately to carry out the production process in separate manner. However, the case analysis of Klassy Kitchen indicates that the factory layout has various types of equipments that are grouped together. This has also contributed towards an increase in the problematic situation for the company (Bell, 2005).", "The analysis therefore indicates that the problems at Klassy Kitchen in its production process mainly arises because of the combination of both the standardized process and customized process together in performing the manufacturing of kitchen cabinets and this is without an appropriate production control mechanism in operation. This problem can be better understood from the application of cause and effect diagram as indicated below:", "The cause and effect diagram above clearly indicates the problematic areas as in respect to the Klassy Kitchen as it mainly highlights the problems in the organizational processes, people and the plant, and the resulting impact is lack of production control. The problems with respect to people management are mainly identified in terms of lack of adequate employees in managing the customized as well as standardized production process, whereas plant problem is identified in terms of its poor maintenance, as the equipments are grouped together and they are not managed well leading to their improper maintenance. Apart from this, the problem within the production process is identified in terms of lack of adequate control with respect to standard production process, and as a result, the entire problem leads lack of proper control over the entire production process. The consideration of both the customized and the standardized production processes at the same time has been the major contributing factor towards the root cause of problem in the operational management at Klassy Kitchen.", "The management of job shop production process has been highly difficult as indicated by Swamidass (2000) because the job shop production process grows larger and it thereby becomes highly difficult to perform its management. The problems in the form of long product throughput times and very large in-process inventory levels often cause difficulties in the effective management of these production processes, and as a result, this process is considered as highly difficult. In the job shop process, the parts spend 95% of the time waiting in queue and it thereby makes the inventory management process in a cost efficient manner as highly difficult. The impact of this job shop production is also experienced in respect to Klassy Kitchen as it has also started experiencing problems in the efficient performance of its production processes. The problems in the form of higher level of work in progress have affected the profitability performance of the company in terms of lower overall profit (Swamidass, 2000).", "Because of combining the customized and standardized production processes, the company has started experiencing problems in respect to making proper scheduling tradeoffs. This is because there are increasing numbers of orders received for the production of standardized products whereas company does not want to reduce its customized production process because of higher profitability as provided by them. As a result, customized kitchens were always given a higher level of priority because of higher profit margins associated with them, and this has created problems in terms of proper scheduling of the processes. The improper scheduling of processes has been root cause of the problem being identified in respect to the work in progress, as the standardized processes were mostly stopped to allow the performance of the customized production process and this has affected the operations in terms of larger work in progress of the raw materials for the standardized product lines.", "Because of the problems as identified in respect to the management of operational process, its impact has been evident in respect to the overall profitability performance of the company. This is mainly in terms of lower profitability levels despite an increase in the sales volume of the company for the cabinet kitchen products. The impact on profitability performance of the company is mainly because there is huge amount of capital and resources that have been blocked as work in progress in the standardized manufacturing process, and this has contributed towards rising inventory costs, charges in the form of cost of capital, and the growth in the ledgers of debtors and creditors. The problem of work in progress has contributed adversely towards satisfying the customers, as there has been an increase in the delivery time from what is promised to customers. This has resulted into higher chances of customers getting dissatisfied because of delay in the delivery of kitchen cabinets and ultimately, impact is in the form of decline in the profitability performance.", "Apart from the problem of increase in the lead times in performing the manufacturing and delivery of cabinets to customers, there was no space left in the layout and this leads to inappropriate management of operational processes in performing the production processes for both categories of production. Staff always looks for better working conditions, and a well established infrastructure in supporting them is crucial from the point of view of encouraging their overall morale in performing the business processes (Isles, 2010). But in respect to Klassy Kitchen, the management of operational infrastructure was not that effective as it is completely occupied with equipments and the same staffs are responsible for managing both the standardized and customized designing of kitchen cabinets. As a result, it leads to decline in the morale of the employees in contributing their maximum efforts for achieving better production and customer satisfaction.", "The various problems as stated above are directly associated with the current problem of lack of production control at Klassy Kitchen, but an in-depth analysis of the case study indicates that there are certain other problematic areas that have given rise to the current problems of lack of production control at Klassy Kitchen. As for instance, in performing the expansion of business activities or in taking any major strategic decisions, a proper planning on the part of management is highly essential regarding the key important considerations that need to be made in achieving better overall performance (Dlabay, Burrow and Kleindl, 2011). But the case analysis of Klassy Kitchen indicates that there has not been any formal planning performed by the managerial personnel and the resulting impact is the ineffectiveness in the management of expansion as performed by the company.", "Apart from the lack of planning, another major problematic area as evident in respect to the Klassy Kitchen is regarding its managerial structure. As for instance, there are various managerial functions that are required to be performed in ensuring the effective management of an organization\u2019s operation, and these mainly include Human Resources (HR), Marketing, Finance, Accounting, Information Technology, Administration, Production and Operations etc. The responsibility of performing all these operational functions of an organization is given to specialized personnel, as accounting managers is responsible for looking after the entire finance related problems whereas the management of employees and the problems faced by them are resolved by the HR managers. This is mainly the task of specialized personnel is performed by the specialists, but this has not been evident in respect to Klassy Kitchen. Its analysis revealed that the problem is mainly the performance of all the important roles by Chinh and Anh Chu themselves.", "Chinh is a master cabinet maker and Anh is a qualified interior designer. They have taken up their responsibilities according as per the specialization initially, but later when their company experienced higher level of growth, they have extended their roles to perform all the specialist functions in the organization. There was no formal identification of roles for the two owners, and their initiative to take the responsibility on their own regarding all managerial functions have contributed significantly towards the performance of the entire organization. The recruitment of a specialized production and control managers would have resulted into better management of company operations, and ultimately the situation for Klassy Kitchen would have been different in terms of its profitability performance. But this aspect has been completely ignored and it has resulted into adverse overall performance of the company in managing its operations in an efficient manner.", "The entire analysis above indicates that the overall management of the operational strategy has not been performed efficiently at Klassy Kitchen and it has resulted into the ineffective management of the expansion in its business. In order to ensure the successful management of change as identified in the case study, it is essential that well established practices or models of change management should be applied so that the effective management of change process can be ensured as desired by the management. An important model of change management that can be applied in successfully performing the change is described as follows:", "The model above discussed about six major stages to successful change management and the first step is mainly the creation of awareness and a sense of urgency about the need for change. As in case of Klassy Kitchen, the managerial personnel were the two owners such as Chinh and Anh Chu and once they have realized about the expansion of their business, they need to create awareness among the management team and should have sensed about the need for separate specialized personnel in handling core organizational functions. The next step to change management as per the model is to engage the culture, and as in respect to Klassy Kitchen, this implies that the owners should create a culture of managing different functions essential in handing the customized and standardized kitchen cabinet designs (Cowan, 2005).", "The third step as per the change management model is to transform the culture, processes and people and this requires the Chinh and Anh to perform transformation in the organizational culture by way of encouraging employees in taking the production process for both the standardized cabinets and customized cabinets separately. This is followed by regular monitoring of results so that the problems as identified above may not occur and the change can therefore be ensured in an efficient manner. The monitoring is followed by providing feedback regarding the ways in which the employees are performing the processes of manufacturing cabinets and the feedback should aim at identifying the loopholes in the performance of employees. Finally, the change management model asserts that the change as introduced should be sustained with higher level of commitments from all the people within organization including the management as well as the employees (Cowan, 2005).", "Overall, a critical analysis as performed of the Craft Shop or Factory indicates about various operational management problems that are faced by the organization in the case study. The analysis revealed that the problems are mainly associated with the operational management within organization as there is no proper management policy in performing the management of change that was experienced in the form of expansion of the business. The analysis revealed that the business was all about the manufacturing of Kitchen cabinets and the focus was mainly on providing customized cabinets to customers but with the increase in the demands for the standardized products, there has been shift in the focus towards producing standardized cabinets for the customers. However, due to higher level of profitability in respect to customized delivery of cabinets, the owner has continued to provide customized cabinets as well (Paton and McCalman, 2008).", "This has significantly enhanced the requirement for additional capacity in performing the manufacturing process, but the owners have continued to carry out the standardized as well as customized production of cabinets under same plant with its existing employees without requiring the need to recruit additional employees. Apart from this, the other major problems as noted from the analysis of the case above include mainly the lack of production control and this is clearly evident from the absence of any planning process in performing the expansion. There was no planning with respect to considering additional workforce in handling the expansion in an efficient manner. The standardized production process as carried out was also without planning and it was not appropriately controlled as well. The plant was ineffectively maintained and since the management has taken up standardized production as well customized production at a time, this leads to inappropriate management of the entire production process. As a result of inefficiency in managing the overall production process, it has contributed towards inefficiencies in terms of higher work in progress and thus it contributes towards inefficient inventory management. These are the major problems that are identified from the case analysis as performed.", "Disclaimer: The reference paper provided by Australian Assignment Help should be used as a model paper, and are not intended to be submitted to the universities.

There are certain aspects which are to be managed with care and are to be taken special care of. This fact stated above can be elaborated further in light of the fact that in case of online retailing things are over evaluated and over estimated. There are several problems which are faced in case of supply chain functions and logistics management all the time and this reason being it has to be managed differently (Stafford 2011).", "In the present article there are several aspects which will be discussed in detail and are related with a newly formed consortium of domestic and overseas investors.

In case of the online retailing company the opportunities are to be explored with special reference to target audiences so identified in Australia. The whole plan has to be configured in such a way that it is capable in dealing with the needs, choices and preferences of the Australian audiences. In this contest some of the options with which this newly established online retailing business will be projected to the consumers are associated with lower prices of the products, wide range to choose from and convenience to shop without any form of physical boundary. In scope of the online retailing company which has been established on part of the consortium members it has been decided that products from Singapore and China will be procured. The procurement will be carried out at very low prices and a local supplier from there will ship products for this company and a regional center for warehousing will be set up in Australia (Stafford 2011).", "There are several techniques which are to be followed so that the situational demands can be entertained and activities can be performed in accordance with it.

So in this context online retailing can be defined as the process of purchase and sale of goods and services between consumers and retailers using the Internet. Along with this definition of online retailing as per the understanding of the consortium members it is also important to mention about their belief that they visualize a positive approach of online retailing in Australia. This belief is held in mind of the members with special reference to car accessories, boating products and electrical appliance (Kowal 2012).", "Online retail and its estimation in the state of Australia are associated with a high growth rate in the transportation and logistics industry. There are several ways with which this increased rate can be justified and this growth of logistics and transportation can be attributed to increased competition among online retailers in Australia. There are various possibilities of growth pertaining to the Australian sate in the field of online retailing. This explains that the level of online retailing will be high and the newly established firm will entertain the mood and tastes of target audiences in Australia.

Along with this, in contemporary scenario, for the purpose of addressing competition at their domestic markets, the company employs the strategy of global expansion strategy. In this strategy, the company is undertaking a number of different mergers and acquisitions in order to set up their business operation at new location. The importance of HR planning also enhances in this context. For a new place company needs to plan the human resource in the manner that the performance of this new venture can go higher.

The recruitment and training procedure adopted by EasyJet is quite sophisticated. While recruiting pilots and other cabin crew members, the company put emphasis over the quality of an aspirant to adopt a new culture and surrounding. In the interview of a candidate, the track record of a candidate related with new project handling is considered intensively (Harvey 2007).", "In comparison to this, Virgin Airlines adopts a target strategy for the recruitment and selection process. Under this strategy the selection of the most suitable candidate is done on the basis of some target characteristic.

In this context, only by motivating the employees, an organization can induce its employees to give their best performance in the favour of the organization. As per the expectancy theory of motivation, an employee can perform his best when he realised that his efforts are being recognized by the management. In this case, reward system can be a crucial measure available to the management to show its concern regarding the efforts of the employee. Rewards can be in both monetary and non monetary terms. For instance, Pfizer, multinational pharmaceutical company, provides some intensive bonus, gifts, and tour packages for its sales force for achieving the targets. These measures help the company to boost the moral of its sales force and achieving the target set by the management (Armstrong 2011)", "For motivating an employee, an organization needs to value the skill, knowledge and efforts of the employee. In this context, the evaluation of a Job performed by the employees can be a good measure. The Job evaluation determines the worth of the Job done by an employee in comparison to other. The pay structure should be quite aligned with the job evaluation process. In this context, Wall-Mart a giant retailer across the globe, employ a frequent job evaluation framework for its different outlets. On the basis of the evaluation of the job, the management come to know about the worth of job done by employee.

In different conditions, the reward system motivates the employees in different manner. The effectiveness of the reward system varies according to the situation faced by the organization. For instance, at growth stage of an organization, the reward system conceives less amount of importance as in such conditions the company enjoys the favourable market conditions. Sales, revenues and profits of organization the organization remains quite high that period of time. Owing to such favourable conditions, the employees of the organization are quite self motivated. They require lesser amount of motivation. In such conditions reward system of the organization is effective only in terms of boosting the profits up to a desired level.", "In addition to this, at time of recession, when the company has to face problems related with revenues and profits generation, there is a need of employing some intensive strategies for motivating employees. In such situations the reward system can be proved quite effective from the perspective of success and sustainability of the organization.

There are a number of different methods employed by the management of organization for monitoring the overall performance of the employee. Such methods of performance monitoring include sudden inspection, daily reporting system, supervisor\u2019s feedback, and benchmarking strategy and so on. An organization can employ one of the most suitable performance monitoring strategies as per its requirements and available resources.", "For example, Pfizer employs the method of benchmarking and Daily reporting system for keeping eyes over the performance of the employee. In benchmarking method, the company set a target for a specific period of time, for different department. This target is set on different basis like for marketing\u00a0 it will be terms of sales and for manufacturing \u00a0department its will be in terms of production. Further for monitoring the performance, the actual performance of the organization is measured against the benchmark performance (Lussier 2011).", "In addition to this, the company employs an automotive reporting system on which the employee needs to report his daily activities to the upper level management so that they can keep eye on daily activities of the employee.", "Cessation or termination of employment can be taken place for three prime reasons listed as below:", "Employment exit procedure of Pfizer:", "The procedure employed by the company is quite systematic.

The managers within an organisation are responsible for managing different categories of employees to achieve positive contribution from them in attaining organisational goals. However, a major problem facing many organisations is regarding the conflicts within their employees. Conflicts are mainly the disagreement among employees on any particular matter, and this leads to arguments within them supporting that their points are better. The resulting impact of such conflicts within organisation is that they adversely affect the morale of the employees and ultimately their performance in the organisation. As a result of this, organisations have to suffer in terms of decline in their performance levels.", "This report is aimed at analysing the conflicts and their impact on the performance of employees and the organisation itself. In performing the analysis, it is argued that conflicts of any type within organisation are detrimental to the employees and the organisation itself. In order to support this argument, the analysis in this report is structured in a sequential manner.", "Conflict is mainly defined as a strong disagreement that occurs between people or groups in an organisation. Conflict is mainly a friction or disagreement within groups of people regarding any particular idea or topic whereby the other members resist or remain unacceptable to the ideas of another member in the group. Such disagreement over the viewpoints of a member within the group by other members is termed as intergroup conflict. Conflict can be understood in different ways as Rahim (2011) indicated that there is no single meaning of conflict as it is defined in a very broad manner and at the same time, it is also defined in a narrow way. The broader definition of conflict indicates that it is a process that underlies organisational behaviour. Contrary to this, conflict is defined in a narrow way as an interactive state whereby the behaviour or goals of one actor is incompatible with that of the behaviour or goals of other actor or actors. Thus the analysis of the concept of conflict above implies that it is a kind of disagreement regarding the viewpoints shared by an individual by others (Rahim, 2011).", "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conflicts in Modern Organisation:\u00a0", "Modern organisations in the 21", "st", "\u00a0century are highly encountered to the issue of conflicts within their employees and this is mainly because of the nature of modern day business organisation which is highly competitive and challenging. As indicated by Morgan (2006) conflict will always be present in organisation. There can be different forms of conflict and these include personal, interpersonal or between rival groups or coalitions. The higher chances of conflicts within organisation are mainly because such organisations encourage organisational politics as they are designed as systems of simultaneous competition and collaboration. This requires the employees to collaborate in order to achieve common goals, and their collaboration leads to differences in the viewpoints being shared by them. The resulting impact is higher overall chances of conflicts (Morgan, 2006).", "It is not only the nature of the organisation that gives rise to higher level of conflicts within organisation, rather there are various other reasons which leads to such conflicting situation. As for instance, the generational shift within organisation is another major contributing factor towards conflicts among employees, and this is positing significant threats to the overall performance level within organisation. The generation X employees have occupied the senior level positions in many organisation, and generation Y employees have started taking major younger positions. The thinking and working approach of gen X and gen Y employees differ significantly which leads to disagreements within them regarding the ways of doing things, and the resulting impact is higher overall conflicts (Deal, 2007).", "An analysis above indicates about the concept of conflicts and various reasons leading to conflicts within employees. However, as argued above, the conflicts have a detrimental effect on the performance of employees within organisation, and this has been indicated in the existing literature as well. As indicated by Deb (2009), decline in the performance of employees is assured if the conflict is dysfunctional and the decline in the employee performance directly contributes towards decline in the performance of the entire organisation. The impact of conflict on employee performance is a highly debated topic among the past scholars as asserted by Kusluvan (2003). The studies in the past have mostly focused towards analysing the relationships between different types of conflict and several individual affective outcomes such as tension, satisfaction, psychological wellbeing, compliance and commitment. The results as identified from the research studies such as De, Dreu, Van and Viannen (2001) indicated a negative association with all the above indicated variables.", "The negative effect of conflicts between group members adversely affects the group climate and it therefore inhibits team effectiveness. The morale of not only the conflicting members, but also the other members in the group declines as a result of conflict and it thereby affects their overall contribution potential in achieving the group goals. The interpersonal conflicts that involves anger and frustration leads to adverse overall impact on the communication and cooperation between group members. A study by Rahim and Afza (1993) as cited in the Kusluvan (2003) indicates that some of the affective reasons lead to the desire of leaving the job by employees. Thus, conflict has the potential of not only affecting the organisational performance, but it also have negative impact in terms of organisation\u2019s losing their key assets (Kusluvan, 2003).", "According to Russell and Russell (2009), the conflicts within employees need to be resolved on immediate basis because it not only affects the performance of an individual employee, but it also leads to an impact over the performance of other employees as well. Thus, conflicts produced by individual employees may disrupt the work of others, and the impact would be severe over the entire organisation\u2019s performance. Thus, immediate efforts are needed on the part of management to protect the organisation from facing adverse threats as a result of conflicts within group members. This shows that the role of conflict over the performance of not only a single employee but a group of employees is negative and this required immediate actions for better overall performance of the employees and ultimately the organisation (Russell and Russell, 2009).", "As indicated by Schultz (2002), there can be serious negative effect of conflict on employee performance, and this is mainly because conflicts diverts the attention from the goal and leads to the depletion of resources such as time and money. The psychological wellbeing of the employees gets adversely affected as a result of conflict and it is the prime contributing factor towards higher level of stress in them. The conflicting thoughts among employees as a result of conflict lead to resentment, anxiety and tension and over a period of time, such conflicting situation if not managed properly would act as a barrier in the creation of a supporting and trusting relationships. The organisations therefore have to suffer in the long run from the conflicting scenario among its employees. The immediate actions are necessary in order to overcome such situation and thereby in attaining positive employee as well as organisational performance (Schultz, 2002).", "The negative impact on employees\u2019 performance and thereby on the organisational performance levels from the conflicts within organisation is also agreed by Maas (2010) by indicating that interpersonal conflict leads to the generation of group rivalry and this may lead to undesirable and objectionable behaviour on the part of its members. In addition to this, conflicts within group members are the main source behind the feelings of opposition, mistrust, disbelief and hostility among the members within various groups. The overall functioning of the organisation gets affected if such tendencies are not checked on time. The situation of goal displacement can also be possible form the organisational conflict because organisational conflicts are become a part of the organisational functioning. The negative effects from organisational conflicts can also be in terms of chaos, disorder and instability. These situations therefore become the primary contributing factor towards disequilibrium of organisational goals and disintegration of the major sub-systems that are involved within the organisation (Maas, 2010).", "The analysis above clearly indicates that the impact of conflict within employees over their performance and the organisational performance is negative. However, a critical analysis of the existing literature indicates that conflict sometimes lead to better growth opportunities to organisation. As indicated by Moshal (2009), conflicting situation sometimes provide opportunities to individuals in order to make an impartial and objective assessment. Further, the conflicts within group members are often a source of gaining new insights regarding the ways of doing things in organisation and thereby allows for better opportunities in accomplishing organisational goals. The resolution of conflicts as performed often allows for better identification of ways in dealing with issues and they therefore leads to better accomplishment of the activities as assigned to group members. In addition to this, the changes as a result of conflict that are introduced in an organisation also justify them because they help managers in searching for new sets of objectives, policies, procedures and values (Moshal, 2009).", "According to Dreu and Gelfand (2007), the entire exercise of resolving the conflict is an important medium in serving an organisation as a tool for organisational development. This is mainly because the occurrence of conflict requires the managers to locate it, identify it and properly analyse it so that necessary measures can be taken on immediate basis to achieve improvement over the existing situation. As a result of the measures undertaken for improving the conflicting situation, it would lead to strengthening of the internal environment and the quality of the internal environment would therefore be upgraded as a result of it. This would therefore reduce any anomalies in the existing organisational processes and therefore, better overall performance can be achieved. This indicates that there can be positive improvements that will be accomplished from undertaking the resolution process of conflict management (Dreu and Gelfand, 2007).", "Overall, the analysis above indicates that the impact of conflicts is detrimental with respect to the performance of employees and ultimately the entire organisation\u2019s performance. However, the analysis also revealed that the improvement over the organisational functions and processes can become possible from undertaking the revamping measures in resolving the conflicting situations.", "This report is based on analysing the impact of conflict over the employee and organisational performance and the analysis is based on the argument that conflicts leads to negative overall impact on employee performance as well as organisational performance. The conduct of the analysis through a critical review of the findings of the past scholars revealed that the conflict has negative over impact on employee as well as organisational performance. The negative impact is mainly because of anger and frustrations as created within the group, and it not only affect an individual performance, but leads to severe negative impact on the performance of the other employees within group and ultimately, the entire organisation\u2019s performance. As a result, immediate measures are required in dealing with such issue of conflict within organisation. However, the analysis also revealed that the potential way of resolving conflicts and better opportunities in achieving processes improvement can be possible from the measures as undertake in dealing with such issue of conflicting situation.

The research was performed with 1550 employees and it has been evaluated that the inclusion of workers from different cultural background has positive effect on their performance.

The main benefit behind the promotion of cultural diversity in the workforce composition within workplaces is that it facilitates organisation with better possibilities of innovation and development of new ideas in doing organisational activities. Cultural diversity benefits groups in terms of better ways of undertaking assigned activities and the resulting impact is improved organisational performance (D\u2019Almeida, 2007).", "It is not only the improvement in organisational performance being possible from cultural diversity, but it also facilitates higher satisfaction of employees in the group and improved morale in accomplishing organisational goals efficiently. A more inclusive and diverse workplace is likely to increase the employee innovation level as indicated in the article, and this is mostly true because there are different attitudes and way of thinking available to a group in solving a particular problem. The minds of culturally diversified employees would produce different ways of solving a problem and thus, better solutions to organisational problems can be achieved. By ensuring cultural diversity, organisations can therefore attain competitive advantage and this is why most of the organisations globally have considered and are considering the inclusion of culturally diversified employees (Hoffmann, 2006).", "Cultural diversity is therefore identified as important from the point of view of promoting innovation within workplace and it should therefore be highly emphasised for achieving positive results. However, the cultural diversity is mainly the result of rapid pace with which organisations are pursuing globalisation, types of cultural diversity in society, and personal cultural attributes (Tchibozo, 2012). An important point as indicated in the selected article is that the cultural diversity leads to economic benefits to the organisation. It is true that the benefits in the form of higher innovation on the part of employees, better employee satisfaction and higher organisational performance can be achieved from maintaining cultural diversity (Thyer, 2010).

However, this attainment of efficiency at workplace requires the management to take active participation in guiding employees because it is a process that may create difficulties or hinders the growth of the organisation\u2019s success (Debrah and Smith, 2001). There are possibilities that there may be difficulties in collaboration because some member may think that their culture is superior and others may have different perception. Thus, there are higher chances of clashes within the group members in respect to cross cultural teams, and this requires a proper management strategy in action in ensuring the efficient management of employees from diverse group (Parvis, 2005).", "The article on happy worker from diverse workplace also suggests that the cultural diversity leads to an increase in the level of employee innovation to a greater level. The performance of survey with the employees in the three organisations lead to the identification that employees have wider feelings from the fact that diversity is maintained at workplace. This indicates that the employees can be motivated through maintaining diversity and they can therefore be encouraged in contributing positively towards accomplishing the main organisational goals in an efficient manner through their collaborative efforts (Kanfer, Chen and Pritchard, 2008). There is a positive relationship being identified in the article between the commitment to cultural diversity within workplace, and the success rate of workplace.", "This relationship as indicated in the study is highly effective as it clearly emphasises the level of commitment needed in ensuring success in managing diverse people. As identified, diversity management is not an easy task because of higher chances of issues creeping in the process, and this necessitates the need for management to remain active all the time to ensure that each and every employee contribute positively towards attaining organisational goals.

Along with this, in contemporary scenario, for the purpose of addressing competition at their domestic markets, the company employs the strategy of global expansion strategy. In this strategy, the company is undertaking a number of different mergers and acquisitions in order to set up their business operation at new location. The importance of HR planning also enhances in this context. For a new place company needs to plan the human resource in the manner that the performance of this new venture can go higher.

The recruitment and training procedure adopted by EasyJet is quite sophisticated. While recruiting pilots and other cabin crew members, the company put emphasis over the quality of an aspirant to adopt a new culture and surrounding. In the interview of a candidate, the track record of a candidate related with new project handling is considered intensively (Harvey 2007).", "In comparison to this, Virgin Airlines adopts a target strategy for the recruitment and selection process. Under this strategy the selection of the most suitable candidate is done on the basis of some target characteristic. For instance, during the interview, the management of the airlines judge the ability of people to make the journey of a passenger intensive and memorable. As per the organizational culture, this ability of the candidate is known as \u201cVirgin Flair\u201d (Bamber 2009).", "On the basis of a comparison between selection and recruitment process of Easy-jet and Virgin Airlines, it can be revealed that there are some intensive benefits availed by such organizations by employing such measures of the recruitment and selection.", "The recruitment strategy employed by EasyJet is quite effective for the purpose of enhancing the effectiveness of the operations of the organization. As the company select the candidate who can easily acclimatize him self according the new organization culture, the organization is required to spend less time and efforts to train the employee.

In this context, only by motivating the employees, an organization can induce its employees to give their best performance in the favour of the organization. As per the expectancy theory of motivation, an employee can perform his best when he realised that his efforts are being recognized by the management. In this case, reward system can be a crucial measure available to the management to show its concern regarding the efforts of the employee. Rewards can be in both monetary and non monetary terms. For instance, Pfizer, multinational pharmaceutical company, provides some intensive bonus, gifts, and tour packages for its sales force for achieving the targets. These measures help the company to boost the moral of its sales force and achieving the target set by the management (Armstrong 2011)", "For motivating an employee, an organization needs to value the skill, knowledge and efforts of the employee. In this context, the evaluation of a Job performed by the employees can be a good measure. The Job evaluation determines the worth of the Job done by an employee in comparison to other. The pay structure should be quite aligned with the job evaluation process. In this context, Wall-Mart a giant retailer across the globe, employ a frequent job evaluation framework for its different outlets. On the basis of the evaluation of the job, the management come to know about the worth of job done by employee. The company undertake this data for revising the pay grades of its employees. \u00a0The company sets its wage structure as per the qualification, skills, accountability and problem solving skills of the employee (Gary 2010).", "Reward system of an organization helps the organization to enhance the efficiency of the operations of the organization. In different conditions, the reward system motivates the employees in different manner. The effectiveness of the reward system varies according to the situation faced by the organization.

Sales, revenues and profits of organization the organization remains quite high that period of time. Owing to such favourable conditions, the employees of the organization are quite self motivated.

Globalization has become the buzzword among businesses as they are performing expansion of their business activities in international markets with a view to achieve higher level of growth in their operations. Further, the limited opportunities as available within their domestic environment have also contributed towards higher level of globalization of activities by these businesses. Although they are performing expansion of their business activities into such international markets, yet an important area of concern to them is mainly with respect to performing the management of their business processes in such a diverse business environment condition. There are various challenges to which businesses are confronted to while performing the management of their business activities in such international markets and this is mainly because of completely different external environment condition in such markets from that of their domestic market (Venter, Hough, Neuland, Erwee and Lange, 2009).", "This essay is aimed at performing an analysis of the various major challenges that managers confront to while managing their business activities at international level. The important challenges will be identified through performing a critical analysis of the existing literature and based on the findings; it will be summarized in the conclusion section of this essay.", "An analysis of the existing literature indicates that the managers of multi national corporations are confronted with significant level of challenges. This is mainly because of large number of factors and this section of the analysis is focused towards analyzing different important aspects related to such challenges as faced by managers. The important challenges as confronted by them in the management of global operations are discussed as follows:", "Cross-Cultural Management Challenges:\u00a0", "This has been an important and the most crucial challenge that is faced by managers while performing the management of global business operation. Cross cultural challenge is mainly a challenge because of the cultural incompatibility as faced by managers in the global business context. The culture of each country differs significantly from that of another and this often poses challenges to the management in performing the successful management of its business activities across the international business environment in an efficient manner. Cross cultural challenge is a massive challenge to managers in global operations and this is mainly because of differences with respect to the cultural values and styles as prevailing across different country environment. As indicated by DuBrin (2011), cross cultural management is an important area that poses significant level of threats to the managers in performing the management of their global operations.", "This is mainly because the value, norms and policies are different across different cultural environment. As for instance, in managing the global business operations, the managers are required to devise appropriate marketing strategies in creating adequate awareness among their target customers in such international markets, in order to persuade them to buy the products and services offerings as made by the business. However, an important factor that these global managers are required to consider is the diverse cultural values and norms as prevalent across such international markets. This has been a major challenge to the global manager because incorporating the international cultural norms and values require them to have in-depth understanding of such diverse cultural values and principles (Gannon and Newman, 2002).", "There are various such examples whereby the global managers failed to fully understand the cultural differences in the international business environment which has adversely affected their reputation. Some of these examples include the case of Coca Cola whereby its managers failed to understand the cultural norms that are prevalent across the international markets and this leads to marketing initiatives undertaken by them which has adversely affected the reputation of the company. As for instance, Coca Cola\u2019s global manager has adopted a strategy of marketing its products and services in Dutch market as \u2018refresh yourself\u2019 within its tagline, but as per the Dutch culture, it has different meaning. The Dutch people have considered it as washing their hands with Coca Cola. This implies that the non consideration of cultural values across international markets adversely affects the image of the organization, and this necessitates it for the global managers that they should make adequate consideration with respect to such cultural differences that persists across international boundaries (Long, 2004).", "The cross cultural management issue has been a major issue facing the global managers because it not only affects one particular business area, but its relevance is there in respect to other major areas of business operations. As for instance, apart from the marketing activities, the impact of cross cultural management issue is evident in other major areas of the business. The cross cultural issue is evident in respect to the management of workforce because the global managers have to work with employees from different cultural backgrounds (Tihanyi, Griffith and Russell, 2005). Since the international management of business activities is performed by majority of the businesses through considering the hiring of locals, this leads to the employees from diverse background and their management has been highly difficult. Management mostly considers the application of their standardized global culture which often creates problems for the diverse people to accept and this ultimately creates difficulties to the global managers in performing the efficient management of their diverse employees (Primecz, Romani and Sackmann, 2011).", "Apart from this, there are various other issues to which global managers are confronted to in respect to international business, and this can be in terms of language barriers. The differences in the language also creates problem for the global managers to perform efficient coordination with their employees across international branches and they also finds it difficult to coordinate well with their customers. The resulting impact is inefficient overall management of their customers and it therefore adversely affects the performance of the entire business in an adverse manner. These are the major issues that are faced by global managers in performing their operations across international boundaries, and all these issues are mainly because of cultural differences that are faced by them across international boundaries. The differences in the national culture from that of global diversity therefore pose threats to the performance of global managers in a successful manner (Gannon and Newman, 2002).", "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ethical Considerations:\u00a0", "This is another major issue confronted by the global managers in performing the management of their business practices across international markets. The global managers are required to take into consideration various important aspects related to ethics in performing the management of their business operations across international boundaries. The task of maintaining ethics has been highly difficult because the policies, procedures, laws, regulations as prevalent in one country varies significantly with that of other, and this have higher overall chances of ethical issues to businesses. The chances of non compliances with the applicable legal rules and policies are significantly higher and this often results into significant challenges to them in performing their business practices in a highly ethical manner. Thus, the ethical considerations are significantly higher and because of differences in policies and legal norms across international boundaries, the issue of performing business activities in a highly ethical manner is highly difficult (Pablos, 2004).", "As indicated by Honeycutt, Ford and Simintiras (2003), the legal challenges are highly applicable to the global managers performing the management of their business activities at international level. As for instance, the main focus of the businesses should remain on providing products and services that best accounts for adequate value of money to the customers. However, in ensuring so, it is highly essential that the needs and preferences of customers should be well known in advance. By having an understanding of their needs and preferences, these global managers can ensure the development of their products that better caters to the needs and expectations of their customers. But it has been highly difficult for the global managers to identify the exact needs and preferences of their customers at international levels and this often leads to the development of products and services that are not suited to such international customers. They often create ethical issues in the sense that the products are categorized as non equivalent to the local standards (Honeycutt, Ford and Simintiras, 2003).", "The ethical issues are also applicable to the global managers in the sense that they work in a completely different working environment conditions in global market and this often leads to their non compliance with various major areas of business activities. As for instance, some countries pay higher level of importance to the social and environmental performance. There are regulatory authorities that monitors the activities of companies with respect to the business activities as carried out by them and their impact over the environment conditions. The customers also shows higher preference level towards the products and services as offered by companies that adopts a higher societal and environmental approach in performing their business activities. However, the higher profit motive of the global managers often leads to lower overall attention towards such environmental and societal performance which often creates ethical concerns to the company (Goerzen, Asmussen and Nielsen, 2013).", "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leadership Issues:\u00a0", "Efficient leadership skill is highly essential within global managers because they need to lead the people from different culture. The leadership style as followed by them across their local or domestic country environment would not prove to be successful in the context of international environment conditions. It is therefore essential that leaders should make proper assessment of the environmental and working conditions across international business environment and they need to make adjustments to their approach of managing international workers through adapting a different leadership style. A welcome attitude towards diverse culture is highly important in becoming an efficient global leader. Such global leaders much encourage and inspire other workers in another country about the future of multinational corporations. Good interpersonal relations are required for the purpose of managing diverse groups of teams from different cultural backgrounds and at the same time, the global leader must also adapt positive initiative towards higher overall success and should be highly oriented towards higher overall success. The issue to the global leaders is therefore the need to monitor their business activities in a different manner across international boundaries. They need to consider wide number of areas and the culturally diverse environment in particular necessitates them to adapt different leadership styles in handling different types of employees (Mcfarlin and Sweeney, 2008).", "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Managing Currency Fluctuations:\u00a0", "This is another international management challenges facing the managers of multinational operations i.e. to perform the management of risk from currency fluctuations. The multinational companies have their operations in more than one country and this exposes them to significant level of currency exchange rate risk. Currency exchange rate risk is mainly the risk faced by businesses from fluctuations in the currency and this therefore affects the profitability performance. The global managers are therefore required to be faced with such issues that arise from changes in the currency rates and they need to devise appropriate strategies through which they can efficiently monitor and manage such fluctuations in currency to achieve better overall profitability performance. The impact of currency fluctuation is direct over the performance of the entire business and it therefore becomes a major issue for the managers to ensure that they are highly protected from such issue in a positive manner. An important strategy that could be applied by them in dealing with such issue of currency fluctuations is mainly the hedging strategy which allows for the management of risks from currency fluctuation in a positive manner (DuBrin, 2011).", "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Copying with the Risk of Imitation and Dangerous Products-\u00a0", "This is a major challenge to global managers in performing the management of their business activities in international markets i.e. the risk of imitation of their key product features by others across such markets. The legal rules as applicable with respect to the protection of trade and copyrights differs significantly across nations and it is therefore essential for the global managers that they should made adequate level of efforts in understanding the trademark and copyright rules as applicable in the target market. This is mainly because the risk of imitating the key product features or its competitiveness is higher within international business environment conditions and the resulting impact would be lack of appropriate level of importance to the products and services offerings as made by company. Hence the global manager is required to make adequate level of consideration with respect to the applicability of risks from imitation across the global markets (DuBrin, 2011).", "Apart from the challenge of protecting the products and services offering from the risk of imitation, the global managers are also confronted with the challenge of assigning the tagline of dangerous products to their products and services offerings. This is mainly because the products that have been highly successful in the domestic market might not prove to be highly successful in respect to global markets, and as a result, it is highly essential that there should be adequate measures that should be adopted to ensure that the needs and preferences of customers in such new market environment are properly understood and the offerings of products and services should therefore be accordingly performed. This indicates the existence of significant level of responsibility on the global managers across the international boundaries which make it extremely challenging and difficult to them in achieving higher level of effectiveness in their operations (Conklin, 2010).", "A critical analysis of the challenges confronting managers in performing the management of global operations of their business across multinational environment is performed in this essay and the performance of analysis revealed significant findings concerning the various such challenges to which global managers are exposed. As for instance, it has been evaluated that the globalization of business activities is performed at a rapid pace by businesses and this has affected their performance in terms of higher overall exposure to significant level of risks to them. The management of business activities across international markets has been extremely difficult since because there are large number of challenges to which global managers are directly exposed. The analysis leads to identification that the most significant challenge is mainly from the cross cultural environment conditions that managers have to face across international environment. This affects all their business activities ranging from marketing functions to the management of human resources within organization. The analysis has also indicated about large number of challenges to global managers in performing the management of their business functions across international boundaries and the major ones as identified include the ethical considerations, leadership issues across such international business environment conditions, managing the issue of currency fluctuation, and also copying with the risk of imitation and dangerous products by the managers.

The primary activities mainly imply the inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics and sales and service to customers. An analysis of the case of Woolworths indicate that the sourcing strategy as adopted by the company is aimed at achieving sustainable performance conditions whereby the company adapts local food sourcing strategy in order to ensure development and growth of local firms. This strategy of locally sourcing food is aimed at supporting the local producers and its purchasing process also indicates that it supports sustainable development.

Change management is concerned with altering the ways in which the existing processes are carried out so that the new ways of doing things will help in the successful and positive attainment of organisational goals for which all the employees are striving. However, an important factor with respect to performing change management within organisation is mainly with respect to nature that the change agents are required to adopt. As for example, the change agents can adopt a rational view while performing change, or they can be emotional about it. However, the main concern with the change management is to achieve overall improvement in the existing organisational processes.", "This essay is therefore aimed at analysing the proposition that the organisational change would be achieved more effectively if people were rational rather than emotional about it. In performing the analysis, the essay therefore focuses on rational thinking in adopting change and it will then analyse the impact of emotional thinking in performing change. Based on the analysis, appropriate conclusion will be reached regarding the effectiveness of change management.", "Change management is an important organisational activity and it requires efficient decision making on the part of change agents. This is mainly because an inefficient change process would adversely impact the performance of the entire organisation. Further, change is usually a very complex process, and it requires adequate level of resources to be utilised by the organisation performing change. Hence, an important factor that is to be assumed in performing change at such a larger level within organisation is that of rationality. As per the rational view, the decision maker has the perfect understanding of the decision problem, which allows the decision maker in selecting the better course of actions so that the attainment of major goals from the change management process can be possible. The rational view therefore implies that the change agent is fully aware of the situation at hand and the entire change management process as carried out. The better understanding of the situation allows for better decision making and thereby, the better attainment of results (Singh and Waddell, 2004).", "This rational process is being considered by the cognitive theorists of change management and as per this rational theory to change management, the process of change is being given due effect by the professionals by way of considering and balancing the advantages and disadvantages of different alternatives so that higher overall success can be achieved within it. It is highly essential that the positive as well as negative aspects should be adequately considered before giving due effect to any change management process within organisation, and the rational view supports this proposition which leads to its consideration in performing change management within organisation. The rational change management decisions are mainly based on facts and figures which lead to their higher accuracy in performing the change process in a positive manner. Thus, the basis of rational decisions is therefore classified as facts, information, and understanding of decision making problem (Grol, Wensing, Eccles and Davis, 2013).", "The rational decisions are taken in a sequential manner which leads to their higher credibility in achieving success in the change management process. The primary steps that are being involved in undertaking rational decision are:", "This particular process to rational decision making indicates that the change agent satisfies himself/herself completely before undertaking any decision for change management. This particular approach to change therefore entitles with the opportunity of achieving higher level of success in the change initiative as undertaken within organisation (Griffin, 2013). Although, the decisions made rationally are considered as highly effective in giving the change process a success, yet the existing literature indicates that the role of emotional decision is also important in allowing for achieving success in the change management process. A study as conducted by Liu and Perrewe (2005) is aimed at analysing the role of emotions in performing organisational change, and the conduct of the study revealed that change agents have to play a crucial role in dealing with emotions on the part of change recipients. The change as implemented within organisation is often a cause of frustration, anger and fear within the employees, and this particular aspect to change can be efficiently dealt in through applying emotional thinking by the change agents (Liu and Perrewe, 2005).", "However, the findings of the study suggest that it is highly difficult to manage and understand the emotions of change recipients during the change process. As a result, there are various models and frameworks that are offered in the existing literature on the change process and it is identified that the inability to appropriately manage the content and intensity of emotions is the major reason for the failure of majority of the change programs. The role of emotions is significantly higher especially during the post performance of change because emotions are crucial in influencing the thinking of employees and influencing them in accepting the change as introduced. The success of a change management process is dependent on the extent to which it is positively accepted by the organisational employees, and emotional decisions have a crucial role to play in motivating employees in positively accepting to change (Liu and Perrewe, 2005).", "Contrary to this, the decisions based on emotions are not given adequate importance in respect to change management process and this is mainly because the emotional decisions are mainly based on judgments, intent, opinion, and conclusion formed about a particular process. Judgments form the basis for intended strategies in respect to emotional change management process and there are higher probability that the decisions taken on the basis of own judgments may be incorrect. The decision based on emotions has certain problems and this leads to their ineffectiveness with respect to change management process as implemented within organisation. As for instance, the perception of individuals with respect to external world gets affected because of emotions.", "The individual that displays positive emotions is likely to perceive the external world as positive, and contrary to this, individual showing negative emotions tend to perceive the external world as negative. This indicates that the entrepreneurs with positive emotions are likely to perceive a broader range of stimuli as compared to the entrepreneurs with negative emotions (Carsrud and Br\u00e4nnback, 2009). Thus, the performance of change management process within organisation through the emotional state of mind may affect the change process depending on the moods of the change agents. This implies that a positive state of mind of the change agent will result into the positive accomplishment of change, and vice versa. Since, change process as identified above involves higher resources and as it is a time consuming process, an organisation cannot afford to achieve ineffectiveness in its implementation. This is an important reason for which the rational decisions are highly preferred over the emotional decisions in performing change management within organisation.", "Emotions are often viewed as important cause of problems during the implementation of change management process. They are not regarded as an expression of underlying difficulties which has been crucial in performing the successful implementation of change. This indicates that a proper management of emotions is essential in order to perform the successful implementation of change. However, the efficient management of emotions will likely to entitle success in the change management process as carried out. In performing change, the entire processes get restructured and there is a need for right people at the right roles and with right capabilities to ensure success in it. In addition to this, it is also essential that there should be adequate commitment and morale on the part of employees that have to perform over the changed processes, and this can be positively attained through emotions.", "Emotions are likely to play a significant role in allowing the change process to achieve success provided they are managed in an efficient way. The changes as made within an organisation mostly involve everyone in such transition process which could be middle managers, HR managers, employees, and they may experience transitions as equally emotional. Emotions can be both the drivers of change as well as consequences of change. However, since emotions emanates from inside an individual, they may differ from individual to individual and they thereby leads to differences in the opinion over the change management process as carried out within organisation. However, an efficient change requires agreement among all the change agents so that the process can be leaded towards a particular goal of attaining success in it (Kiefer, 2002).", "As per the traditional understanding, emotions can play an important role in making the employees to adapt to organisational change as introduced. The changes as introduced by change agents as a part of change management process can achieve success in it provided that induce the employees to accept to such change. Employees can be made to adapt to such change through emotions, and they can be motivated to learn new strategies so that the refined goals as a result of change can therefore be positively accomplished. The adaptive behaviour of employees is driven by their emotions as asserted by Klarner, Todnem and Diefenbach (2011) and thus, rational decisions in performing change management would not be highly effective. It is essential that the employees should be made adoptive to the changes as introduced by the change agents so that the main goals behind performing the change can be positively accomplished (Klarner, Todnem and Diefenbach, 2011).", "The analysis above indicates about the change management process as implemented within organisation through considering the rational view and the emotional view, and the performance of the analysis revealed that the rational view involves sequential steps or a critical understanding of the process of change before its actual implementation. However, the emotional viewpoint is identified as a barrier in the process of successful implementation of change because they do not express the underlying difficulties associated with the change management process. Apart from this, the effectiveness of the rational decision in performing the change management is also identified from the fact that emotion plays a crucial role in making rational decisions. As per a study, Wong (2001) clarifies that emotions play a role in rational decision making and they thereby enhances the change management process as undertake on the basis of rational decision making process.", "A critical analysis of the proposition that organisational change would be accomplished in a more efficient manner when people are rational rather than emotional about it is performed. The performance of the analysis revealed that the above proposition is true to the certain extent only. This is mainly because the rational decisions are identified as crucial as any change management process should be based on facts and proper understanding of the problem in hand. But the role of emotional decision making has also been identified as crucial from the analysis as performed in the study. This is mainly because the emotions have a critical role to play in achieving adaptive behaviour among employees which is highly crucial once the changes are implemented. This is because, the introduction of change management process leads to complete transition to the existing organisational processes and thereby in achieving success in it, it is essential that the employees should be adoptive to such changes rather than resisting against them. As a result, the emotions have a crucial role to play in motivating employees to become adaptive to the changes as introduced by management.", "Table of Contents", "Disclaimer: The reference paper provided by Australian Assignment Help should be used as a model paper, and are not intended to be submitted to the universities.

The analysis leads to identification that the external and internal governance mechanism is separately performed and the role of external governance is crucial because McDonald Australia is operation on the franchise model. The analysis leads to the identification of basic sources of cost competitiveness and differentiation to McDonald Australia and this is mainly in terms of the significant level of presence of McDonald which allows for achieving economies of scale and ultimately cost competitiveness attainment by the organisation. The position of McDonald Australia has been analysed in relation to its competitors and it is evaluated that the organisation occupies the top most level in the industry. The strategic analysis through VRIO analytical tool has been performed and it is analysed that the core competencies in the form of highly efficient human resources, sound infrastructure and good brand reputation has allowed McDonald in achieving good position across the industry. Based on this, it is recommended that human resource manager is required to put additional efforts, and it should look for achieving further improvement in its reputation so as to remain competitiveness in the industry.", "Introduction", "The strategic analysis of an organisation requires the consideration of various important aspects. As for instance, in strategically analysing an organisation, it is essential to evaluate the internal and external forces affecting an organisation and the strategies that are being pursued. The internal and external governance of an organisation is a crucial factor affecting the performance of an organisation and as such, it is essential to evaluate the internal and external governance mechanism that affects the decision making process within organisation. Apart from this, there are certain important sources of competitive advantage to an organisation and this can be in the form of cost or differentiation advantage. The value chain analysis of an organisation is crucial as it helps in identifying the value creating activities. The strategic analysis requires the consideration of all these aspects so that the performance of an organisation can be strategically evaluated and appropriate recommendations can be made to achieve improvement over the performance level of the organisation (Goldman and Nieuwenhuizen, 2006).", "This report is aimed at performing the strategic analysis of an organisation, and the organisation as selected is McDonald Australia. In performing the strategic analysis of McDonald, the external and internal governance mechanism as followed across McDonald will be evaluated and this is followed by performance of an industry analysis to evaluate the basic sources of cost and differentiation advantage. The value chain analysis of McDonald will be performed and VIRO analysis will be performed to analyse whether they are strategic resources. Based on the analysis of the strategic resources of the organisation, appropriate recommendations would be made for the development of strategic resources.", "The successful operations of an organisation require appropriate governance mechanism practices within organisation. There can be internal and external governance mechanism practices within organisation to ensure the most efficient performance of organisation\u2019s practices. An analysis of McDonald Australia indicates that there is both the internal and external governance mechanism that are being practiced to ensure that the customer needs and requirements are timely met. The mode of operations across McDonald Australia indicates that it is operated as per franchise model whereby the branches across Australia are operated on franchisee basis. The governance mechanism is therefore carried out at both the internal and external level across the organisation. The external governance mechanism is carried out by the top level managerial people across McDonald whereby the managerial people from centralised location perform the management of operations of the franchise. They ensure the governance of franchisee by way of controlling the menus, and efficiently meeting out the requirements of their customers in a positive manner.", "The external governance is mainly carried out by way of policies and procedures as set out by headquarter. As for instance, the quality standards as set up by the centralised business operations are required to be observed by the franchisees as operating across Australia, and it is also essential for them that they should look for adapting organisational practices as specified by the senior level managers from the centralised headquarter of the company. In these ways, the external regulatory mechanism has been enforced across Australian franchisees of McDonald and such governance has been highly effective from the point of view of having proper control of the franchisees. Apart from this, the internal governance mechanism has also been highly crucial because in case of the franchisees of McDonald across Australia, the major strategic decisions are taken from headquarter regarding the menu offerings, quality standards etc, but it is the local franchisee owner that have to perform the management of daily operations of the business activity. As such, the internal governance has also been highly crucial from the point of view of performing business activities across McDonald franchisees in an efficient manner. The internal governance is the responsibility of the franchisee owner, and this is ensured at McDonald Australia by way of its core philosophy which has been to act in an ethical, truthful and dependable manner.", "In these ways, the internal and external governance has been practiced across McDonald Australia and this leads to efficient overall performance of the operational processes across the corporation.", "Ownership Concentration, Structure and External Control:\u00a0", "An analysis of the ownership concentration across McDonald Australia indicates that it is operated as per the franchise model whereby various major franchisees of the corporation are opened across different states in Australia. The ownership concentration suggests that it is based on franchise model of operations and the organisational structure indicates that it is hierarchical structure that has been followed across the company. The senior most position in the hierarchy is occupied by the CEO/managing director and there are different respective heads for different organisational departments such as chief financial office, director of marketing, director of operations and so on (McDonald Australia, 2014). In terms of external control is concerned, an analysis of the case of McDonald Australia indicates that the activities of the organisation are majorly controlled externally through having influence of the managers from centralised department of the organisation.", "The industry that has been in operational is mainly the fast food industry in respect to McDonald and every industry has certain major sources of competitiveness. As such, in respect to the given fast food industry, there are certain major sources of competitive advantages to the operators. As for instance, the basic source of cost advantage is the economies of scale and this has been possible in respect to such fast food industry because of operations being carried out on wider basis within such industry condition. As in respect to McDonald, the basic source of cost advantage to it is mainly in the sense that the company operates on global basis and this allows it in achieving cost competitiveness from making bulk purchases of its requirements for all its franchisees across the globe. This has been the cost competitive factor associated with the entire operations of McDonald Australia (Kauffman and Tallon, 2009).", "Apart from this, there also exists the differentiation advantage in respect to such fast food industry and this is clearly evident from the fact that there are specific differentiation factors that allows the fast food retailers in differentiating themselves from others. As in respect to McDonald Australia, it differentiates itself in the entire industry in terms of offering hamburger to its customers. It specialises in providing hamburgers to its customers and this has been the main source of differentiating factor as noted in respect to McDonald Australia. Thus, the cost as well as differentiating factors is highly crucial from the point of view of making significance in respect to such fast food industry and these aspects are positively utilised by McDonald in serving its customers in a positive manner. The cost advantage is mainly achieved by way of economies of scale in its operations whereas the differentiation advantage is achieved in terms of offering specific features in its products and services offerings that leads to higher level of recognition of the company within its targeted customers (Reading, 2004).", "Positioning of McDonald in Relation to its Competitors-\u00a0", "The fast food retail chain industry is comprised of large number of competitors and this therefore implies that the industry is highly competitive. As for instance, the major players as operating within such fast food industry includes McDonald, Pizza hut, Dominoes, Burger King and various other local players. The positioning of McDonald in relation to all its competitors is indicated as follows:", "The positioning of McDonald in relation to its competitors as indicated above implies that it occupies the largest market share in the industry and the growth potential has also been higher. The graph above indicates that McDonald occupies the leading position in the industry and this is followed by KFC which occupied higher market share in the industry. This is followed by Burger King that has competitiveness in the industry and finally, it is Pizza Hut that dominates the industry conditions. The overall position of McDonald indicates that it has attained significantly higher and dominating position in the industry (Kaplan and Norton, 2004).", "The value chain is an important strategic analytical tool that helps in identifying the activities that creates value within organisation. There are various important activities that are included within the value chain of the company and these are broadly classified as primary activity and support activity. The primary activity includes inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales and service. The support activities include firm infrastructure, human resource management, technology development and procurement. These activities allow for efficiently carrying out the organisational processes and they in turn enable the organisation in achieving higher level of competitiveness with respect to their operations.", "In respect to McDonald Australia, the value chain analysis indicates about the primary activities which mainly includes infrastructure and an assessment of McDonald\u2019s infrastructure in Australia implies that the company has built up significant infrastructure conditions which enables it in catering to the needs and requirements of its customers in Australia in a positive way. The case analysis of McDonald Australia indicates that its infrastructure comprises of all ranges of equipments that are essential in delivering the wide variety of menu as offered by the company. McDonald Australia specialises in covering full menu and this has been possible mainly because of supportive infrastructure that allows for delivering high range of services. Apart from this, another important element of value chain is inbound logistics which indicates the receipt of raw materials and in respect to McDonald Australia, the suppliers of raw materials are both direct as well as indirect and they\u00a0 accounts for providing highest quality of raw materials (Weele, 2009).", "The inbound flow of materials is performed on Just In Time (JIT) basis and the operational processes are also carried out in a specific manner across McDonald Australia in order to cater to the needs and requirements of customer specific demands. There has been higher level of commitment of McDonald Australia employees towards providing high quality foods and superior class of services and this commitment level indicates about the operational effectiveness that has been prevalent within the organisation. The attainment of higher operational efficiency is ensured at McDonald Australia in the sense that the company work with its employees, franchise and suppliers to achieve higher level of effectiveness (Collier and Evans, 2009).", "Apart from this, the outbound logistic element of value chain indicates about the marketing, sale and delivery of the finished products and services to final consumers. In respect to McDonald, the marketing activities as carried out by the organisation imply that it is focused towards promoting its products and services among its targeted customers. McDonald has undertaken marketing initiatives at a global level whereby it has entered into Olympic sponsorship for promotion, and endorsed the Coca Cola brand as well. McDonald Australia has also considered for large number of health and wellness campaigns and its popularity is mainly evident in terms of the hamburger as offered by it. The friendly customer sales services allows for attaining higher level of effectiveness in respect to after sales services by the company. The friendly customer sales services is not the only factor that positively supports the organisation\u2019s operations, but it is the effectiveness of the employees working across the organisation, as they have higher level of efficiency in providing quality products and services to their customers.", "The analysis of the value chain in respect to McDonald Australia indicates about various major elements in allowing organisation in efficiently delivering its offerings to its customers. The analysis leads to identification that the main source of competitive advantage is mainly the strong brand reputation including the highly efficient infrastructure and human resources as possessed by McDonald Australia which allows for delivering higher quality products and services to final consumers. Strategic human resources along within sound infrastructure and technological competence with McDonald become the core competitive advantages with the organisation.", "VRIO analytical tool is an important strategic analytical tool that helps in evaluating the resources of an organisation. It is a framework that assesses the resources and capabilities of a firm and thereby ascertains the overall competitive advantage as possessed by the organisation. There are four major questions to the VRIO acronym and these are mainly the question of value, the question of rarity, the question of imitability and the question of organisation. These questions are essential to be asked to evaluate the potential of competitive advantages with organisation. VRIO analytical tool has therefore been highly crucial from the point of view of assessing the effectiveness of competitiveness as available with an organisation. As in respect to McDonald Australia, the analysis above indicated about various important core competences of the organisation. The assessment of these competitive sources through VRIO analytical tool is performed as follows:", "The Question of Value:\u00a0", "This particular question of value asks whether a resource enable a firm to exploit an environmental opportunity and the case analysis of McDonald indicates that it has certain major sources of competitive advantage that allows for attaining value in its business. Such source has been the highly reputed infrastructure with the organisation which allows McDonald in exploiting the growth opportunities in the fast food segment across the industry. Thus, in terms of value factor, the resource as available with McDonald has been highly effective from the point of view of allowing the organisation in achieving higher overall value in its business processes. Apart from this, the human resources has also been highly effective and talented and this is evident from the fact that they prepare food items that are effective enough in attracting customers. This shows that the competitive advantage in terms of sound infrastructure and quality human resources are crucial in terms of allowing the organisation to achieve higher value to the firm (Katsioloudes, 2012).", "The Question of Rarity:\u00a0", "This question of rarity assesses whether the competitive advantage as possessed by the firm is rare or is it available in the markets easily for the competitors. The competitive advantage with an organisation is considered as highly effective if it is rarely available in the market. The case analysis of McDonald indicates that the core competitiveness in terms of brand reputation with McDonald as the superior company in the fast food industry has been highly effective and rare because it is not possible for a new comer to establish the reputation as developed by McDonald across the globe. In this respect, the question of rarity has been efficiently satisfied with regard to the competitiveness of McDonald and it therefore enhances the overall effectiveness level of the competitive advantage with the organisation.", "The Question of Imitability:\u00a0", "This question of imitability assesses whether the core competency as possessed by an organisation is imitable by others or not. Core competitiveness is regarded as highly effective if it cannot be copied by others. The case analysis of McDonald Australia indicates that the core competency with the organisation is difficult to imitate because it has established a brand reputation of being the superior company across the world within the fast food industry. This established reputation of long years by McDonald is difficult to imitate. McDonald is popularly known for its hamburger across the globe and with such established presence all over the world and significantly higher level of acceptance within its customers, it would be difficult for a new comer or an already established fast food retailer to build such image. Thus, it is highly difficult to imitate the core offerings as made by the company.", "The Question of Organisation:\u00a0", "This is the final question within VRIO analytical framework and it questions whether the valuable resources that are rare or inimitable are properly organised to achieve maximum level of contribution from it towards achieving higher level of growth. Based on the performance of analysis of McDonald Australia, it has been analysed that the higher managerial effectiveness has allowed the entire organisation in achieving the leading position throughout the globe. Such a significant level of growth and reputation in the world market for McDonald indicates that the organisation of resources of the organisation has been performed in an efficient manner.

The analysis of the past implies that Qantas was founded in Winton, Queensland on 16", "th", "\u00a0November 1920. The initial operations of the airline implies that the airline operated as air mail services subsidised by the Australian government and was popularly known as linking railheads in western Queensland. Between the periods of 1926 to 1928, the airline has developed various aircraft and in 1935, Qantas carry passengers to international destinations for the first time. Thereafter, Qantas has achieved significant growth and it is now popularly known as the flagline carrier of Australia and one of the oldest and largest airlines in the world.", "At present, Qantas offer air travel services across all major parts of the world and the airline also has access to various long aircrafts that have the capacity to carry 450 passengers at a time. The major strategic growth has become possible to Qantas once the Australian Government sold the domestic carrier Australian Airline in 1992 and followed by it in 1993, Qantas was privatised. This has resulted into huge purchases of aircrafts by Qantas in order to increase its fleet and destinations, and the resulting impact is that the airline today is known as the premium long destination airline that serves majority of the regions across the world. Thus, at present, the airline can be said to be at the top most position in the entire airline industry, as it provides premium air travel services across all the major regions in the world.", "However, the future outlook of the airline implies that the airline seeks to achieve higher level of growth and recognition within the entire airline industry across the world. Although, the past and the current performance of Qantas imply that the airline has achieved higher level of growth, yet the formal announcement by the airline about its strategic plans in the next five year indicates that the airline seeks to achieve higher international growth by performing alliances with other major airlines such as Malaysian Airline, British Airways and South African Airways. The airline is also improving its forefront in terms of providing low cost air travel services through its subsidiary Jetstar. The deregulation of the entire airline industry has given rise to higher level of competition among the existing players and in response to this, Qantas subsidiary Jetstar seeks to compete through its low cost strategy (Australia\u2019s airline Qantas announces five years plan, 2011).", "In case of Qantas airlines, it is also having certain strength points. As for instance, the major strength point of Qantas is that the airline has access to profitable domestic routes that accounts for majority of its profitability. At present, majority of the routes are served by Qantas which allows it in sustaining the leadership position in the industry. In addition to this, Qantas has well developed reputation within the airline industry, as it is known as the flagline carriers of Australia and also accounts for the position of most premium airline in the entire airline industry. Apart from this, Qantas is world\u2019s leading long distance airways and it is continuously expanding its network by forming alliances with other major airlines throughout the world. Thus, the main strength point from the discussion can be considered as the monopoly as sustained by Qantas in terms of accessibility to the profitable domestic routes (Coorey and O\u2019Sullivan, 2012).", "The next major aspect of SWOT analysis is weakness and it is internal to an organisation. Qantas is also suffering from certain kinds of weaknesses and the major weakness of Qantas airline is that the airline does not have strong features that would allow it to sustain even though its profitable routes are being under the threat of competition. As indicated by Prahalad and Hamel (1993), every organisation should have certain core competence area that would allow it in achieving competitive advantage over others and also ensure the sustenance of the firm in the turbulent situations. The core competence area is the strength point of the organisation that others cannot imitate as indicated by Prahalad and Hamel (1993). But in case of Qantas, the case analysis revealed that the decision of Etihad to acquire stake has raised concern over the sustainability of Qantas and this can be regarded as the major weakness of the organisation (Coorey and O\u2019Sullivan, 2012).", "Apart from strengths and weaknesses which are internal to the organisation, opportunities and threats are regarded as external to an organisation. Opportunity implies the available options to an organisation to achieve higher level of growth and they allow them in attaining superior position in the industry (Bohm, 2009). With respect to Qantas case, the analysis indicates that the Qantas has the opportunity to achieve higher level of growth in its international operation through seeking permission for foreign direct investment. At present, the company is restricted from foreign direct investment by the Foreign Investment Review Board and by getting freed from such restrictions, Qantas can not only perform the foreign direct investment, but it will also able to effectively compete with the other major airlines at both the domestic as well as international arena. Thus, the opportunity to achieve significant growth exists with the airline as reflected from the case study (Coorey and O\u2019Sullivan, 2012).", "Finally, the threats imply the adverse impact as posed by the external environment to an organisation. Threats are also external to an organisation and an organisation has limited control over the threats as posed to it by the external environment. In relation to Qantas, the case analysis indicated that Qantas is faced with significant threats from the external business environment that leads to claim by the MPs of Qantas that it would go under from the acquisition of a stake by Etihad over Virgin Australia. The major threat to the Qantas from such a deal between Etihad and Virgin is mainly because of the Qantas Sale Act as imposed by Foreign Investment Review Board which restricts the airline from competing with others. Further, the Qantas Sale Act limits the foreign direct investment to 49% and this act as a major threat to the airline in competing effectively (Coorey and O\u2019Sullivan, 2012).", "This section of the report is aimed at performing strategic analysis of Qantas with specification of its corporate and business level strategy.

The airline seeks to pursue higher level of growth in terms of its routes and number of destinations and this is quite revealed in the five year strategic plans as revealed by the airline. This corporate strategy of higher growth is mainly sought to perform by Qantas through performing alliances with other major airlines operating throughout the world, as this is an important way of entering into foreign markets and to provide services (Australia\u2019s airline Qantas announces five years plan, 2011).", "Execution of Corporate Level Strategy through Functional Level:\u00a0", "The corporate level strategy of Qantas to perform expansion of its air travel services across major regions of UK, US and Asia requires significant level of support from various functional level of organisation.

It has over 8,613 retail outlets under 55 different banners in 15 countries. It has over 2 million employees globally. Its headquarters are in Bentonville, Arkansas. It is the largest grocery retailer in the United States. In the U.S., it operates through discount stores, supercenters, neighborhood markets, and through walmart.com (About us 2012).", "Wal-Mart\u2019s basic strategy revolves around low costs and high volumes. The company\u2019s strategic planning aims at maintaining low prices and offering quality customer service so that customers could be fully satisfied. If the average operating expenses throughout the industry are compared against that of Wal-Mart\u2019s, then still the operating expenses of Wal-Mart turns out to be relatively lower. The reason for such low operating costs lies in its high quality and efficient distribution network. The distribution network derives its efficiency from the fact that it locates its stores in a strategic manner, manages supply and order related information efficiently through latest information technological tools, makes use of cross-docking, and strategic expansion designs. The pricing strategy being followed by Wal-Mart is of market penetration, as it concentrates on offering \u201ceveryday low prices\u201d. It captures significant market share through this strategy and takes advantage of economies of scale in production, and produces on a mass scale. Another vital strategy that is instrumental to its success and growth is the quality customer service it offers. High quality customer service in comparison to other discount retailers is derived through employees who are high in morale, prices that are relatively low, and customer information that is managed efficiently. As there are a wide range of products available in the stores of Wal-Mart, therefore it is very convenient for the customers to shop for all their needs at just one destination (Kneer 2009).", "The mission of Wal-Mart is to improve the living standard of a common man by means of relatively low priced and quality goods offered by the company, along with the superior customer service. One of the significant aspects of the success of Wal-Mart has been its choice strategic location of its stores. Wal-Mart used to set up its stores at locations where none of its direct competitors\u2019 stores exist. The central part of its general strategy is to keep costs low, which it achieves by higher volumes and keeping level of inventory low. Supply chain efficiency also contributes in reducing the distribution costs. The efficient supply and distribution network of Wal-Mart is a result of strategic relationships with suppliers and implementation of high end information technology tools. Wal-Mart also makes use of sophisticated data-mining techniques to collect information on buying behavior of customers in order to forecast demand, enhance customer service, and keep inventory levels low. Some of the new aspects of the Wal-Mart strategy are its increased focus on internationalization, opening up of different formats other than supermarkets, and extension of product range. Since the United States market of Wal-Mart is fast approaching a mature state, therefore the company is on the lookout for foreign destinations to expand its operations globally. In order to accomplish this task, Wal-Mart is adopting a range of strategies from strategic alliances to mergers and acquisitions. Another new aspect of its strategy is to offer a more comprehensive range of products to its customers so its customer base gets increased and thus there would be an increase in its business. Under this, services like banking, insurance, and travel are now being offered to its customers. Formats like neighborhood stores are a new initiative of Wal-Mart (Munzer 2009).", "Universal bar codes were introduced in the retail industry by Wal-Mart, which forced manufacturers to adopt common labeling. Over the years, Wal-Mart has used the information behind the bar code to its advantage and developed latest technology to track its inventory and cut the costs out of its supply chain. Wal-Mart not so long ago, pioneered the usage of radio frequency identification technology, popularly known as RFID, and demanded the producers for its usage. In this technology, data is transmitted through radio frequency, and small tags can be used for the storage of such data, and in comparison to the bar codes more data could be stored in such RFID tags. The use of this technology has significantly reduced out-of-stock merchandise levels (", "Wilbert 2012", "). Wal-Mart has been extremely successful in the past, and has a very promising future ahead of them. But it is faced with opposition from small stores in small communities, as well as employees. In order to address these issues, Wal-Mart has already taken giant strides to be seen as a more environmentally friendly organization, as well as to increase the benefits of its employees.

It is inclusive of all the varied forms of marketing practices which are base on the use of internet and related forms of information technology. These types of marketing practices are carried out by companies which are keen to target all the consumers who are aware of internet and are associated with a different class and lifestyles.

To illustrate further about the offline marketing practices the popular techniques of this section can be stated here and they are local advertising in newspapers and on television, hoarding, billboards and the likes. For having a overview about the marketing practices which are popularly being followed on parts of varied companies it is clearly visible that there is need to strike a perfect balance among the online marketing efforts and the offline marketing efforts (Challenges faced by marks and Spencer 2012).", "The same technique is being employed by the concerned management giant and retailing company Marks and Spencer. The close association among the offline and online marketing efforts of the companies will account for multiplier effect. The companies will get more and more exposure in the public domain and as a result of striking this balance the use and purpose of a perfect marketing plan will be realized to the greatest possible extent. Same is the case with Marks and Spencer as the company is keen to make use of both online and offline marketing practices and to make most of the available opportunities (Lynch 2007).", "Along with the above stated two marketing forms there are several other types of marketing practices and they can be defined as inbound marketing, outbound marketing, newsletter marketing, article marketing, tradeshow marketing, search marketing, direct marketing, niche marketing, social media marketing, drip marketing, referral marketing, guerilla marketing , promotional marketing, affiliate marketing, reverse marketing, business to business marketing, viral marketing, mobile marketing, telemarketing, direct mail marketing, business to consumer marketing and\u00a0 personalized marketing (Slack, et al. 2009).", "All these tool used in the field of marketing are specified and work well with specified situation and as result of which most of the companies pick out the best associated type to make use and get results from.", "In case of our concerned company, which is Marks and Spencer there are several possibilities which state that use of all the above mentioned marketing practices is possible in one situation or the other. But this not possible and does not seem to be viable option as the companies are assigned with specified marketing budgets and making use of which they are required to give desirable results. This indicates that rather making use of all the available option to nay company it will be more judicious to pick out the best option to get more and more results out of them (Jeannet and Hennessey 2005).", "In case of Marks and Spencer the company has faced several issues because of which the image of the company got tarnished among the consumers. This explains that to have a effective marketing strategy will require to conceal all the old patches and to give a new and fresh look to the company which is acceptable to the consumers and they feel willing to make use of organizational products and services. The image of the company spoiled in the public domain because of the decisions and verdicts so made by the French courts (Handlin 2012).", "At the time of late nineties it was believed that the company was not practicing the correct policies with its workers and was being harsh to them.

This caused lot many problem areas to be dealt on part of the company and the company was in crisis. All the rescue operations were failed and were not working and at such a critical point of time the only life saving technique comes out in way of any company talks about marketing strategies and their use in the most efficient manners so that the target consumers can be convinced with the whole idea (Marks & Spencer 2012).", "The scope of activities associated with the concerned company is very vast and there are lot many stores or outlets of the company. This indicates about the fact that the scale of operations is very large and as result of which the marketing efforts have to work on large scale too. At the same time a very important fact to be mentioned here talks about the need of being correct as there is very less possibility of going wrong and survive back. The above stated fact can be elaborated further as it talks about a keen analysis to choose the most appropriate marketing strategy as the strategy will be practiced on a large scale and if it goes wrong the results will be faced by the company on a large scale which can turn out be devastating in nature (Marks & Spencer 2012).", "This is an evident fact that the concerned company, Marks and Spencer, is the largest British retailer with approximately 150 stores in more than 30 countries all over the globe. In addition with this the network of Marks and Spencer also comprises of 130 franchise business units functional in different parts of the world. The popularity enjoyed by the company is also very high and this is fact that vouches for the effectiveness they incorporate in their marketing strategies. There are several uncertainties which are associated with the marketing strategies so devised to be used with any particular company. (Marks & Spencer 2012).", "The very first uncertainty to be mentioned here and which was also applicable to our concerned company, Marks and Spencer, talks about the difficulty to accurately allocate measurable returns in associated with the marketing expenses so incurred on part of any company. This is a cruel reality as in spite of carrying out population surveys and generating favorable results form the targeting the marketing strategies fail. This is all because of the subjectivity associated with the consumers which can turn out exactly opposite to the generalized result so derived from the surveys (Meidan 1982).", "The marketing strategy so adopted and practiced on part of Marks and Spencer highlights the aspect of global expansion which can also be termed as internationalization of the company. In the first place when we are discussing about the marketing strategy of Marks and Spencer there is need to focus on the initial phase and the improvised and altered new phase of their marketing strategy. This explains that the marketing strategy used on part of Marks and Spencer can be categorized into two separate phases and these phases can be the old phase and the new phase (Hill and Jones 2012).", "The old phase comprises of the old marketing strategies which were used on part of Marks and Spencer and it is important to state that these strategies were quite simpler and straight forward in contrast with the multi channel marketing strategies popularly used by various companies active in contemporary business area stuck with cut throat competition. Earlier at Marks and Spencer it was believed to produce high quality goods and simply offer them to the consumers at a reasonable price which is affordable to them but it is not cheap at the same time (McDonald 2011).", "The reason for such a philosophy indicated that there is need to position the products and services at a good position in the minds of the prospective consumers. Over positioning and under positioning will cause harm to the products and the consumer will not be able to relate the marketing strategy with the products so offered. So in order to get rid of the problematic situation the company concerned a simple yet effective marketing strategy which was believed to be the essence of effectiveness at Marks and Spencer.", "The concerned organization took account of such an important point regarding positioning of their products on a correct level in the minds of prospective consumers talks about the effectiveness itself. Marks and Spencer always maintained a high quality approach towards its products and to practice such a technique the company aimed to become hot favorite among the consumers that they are offering best of the quality at the most reasonable price. This strategy provided immense satisfaction to the consumers that they have made the right decision of purchasing with Marks and Spencer (Marks & Spencer 2012).", "Along with the quality aspect there is one more point which was emphasized in case of old marketing strategy at Marks and Spencer. This point indicated the use of brand name and to establish a brand name there is need to make use of most effective and efficient marketing strategies. The sue of marketing strategies is related with the quality aspects as it provides base to the most impactful and impressive marketing strategy which is termed as viral marketing and is also stated in the earlier section o this report. Viral marketing is also defined as word of mouth which is expressed by consumers after making use of the products so offered on part of the company or availing the services which are being provided to the consumers.", "Viral marketing is the ultimate key to success when the effectiveness of marketing strategy is talked about as the consumers themselves are keen to inform other consumers about the good and bad aspects of the company products. In this order companies will strive to make use of this technique in a positive manner and hence they automatically need to focus on the quality o products and services which are being offered on their part. The high quality and the affordable prices will be the elements which were being highlighted in case of viral marketing.", "As a result of this the company products became popular and Marks and Spencer managed to establish itself as the biggest retailer of the Europe in that era. But as the verdict and decision from the French courts came out the scenario changed completely and the criticism of the concerned company, Marks and Spencer, were the hot topic among people. It was believed that the company is not doing good to the organizational workers and the organizational consumers were convinced with the idea that purchasing with Marks and Spencer will automatically represent them as the ambassadors of this sort of behavior (Marks & Spencer 2012).", "This was the time when the image of Marks and Spencer was completely spoiled and the sales figures declined a great deal and this indicated need to devise a new marketing strategy with which the consumers can be convinced to invest their faith and trust in Marks and Spencer once again. In the old philosophy it was believed that focusing on the manufacturing and production related practices will help in highlighting about the marketing aspects too but this was not believed to be true when the new marketing philosophy came into existence and practice with the giant British retailer, Marks and Spencer.", "The discontinued earlier marketing strategies and the birth of new marketing strategies at Marks and Spencer can be explained in light of the fact that the company started to lose its competitive advantage to other active retailers in the domestic front. The changed consumer preferences and the declining sales figures were the accelerating elements which caused Marks and Spencer to review its marketing strategy.

But this was not the case with business analysts as they told a completely different story on their part which caused such a drastic change in the position and status enjoyed by Marks and Spencer. The analysts concluded in their analyses that the changes have occurred because of the dull merchandising practices which were being carried out on part of Marks and Spencer (Deloitte and Touche 2012).", "Along with this the analysts also pointed out that the concerned company, Marks and Spencer was not much responsive about the competitive obligations which were being imposed on it.

This clarity of thoughts led the company to devise new marketing strategy altogether and the company planned to get back its situation and as a result of it the company reinvented into internationalization.

But in addition with this it is also important to state that this global expansion strategy has not helped Mark and Spencer to regain its status of market leader in the UK. This is because of the presence of lot of competition in the retiling market and the current leadership was being enjoyed on part of Wal-Mart.", "The internationalization marketing strategy by Mark and Spencer was high on differentiation of products as per the choices and preferences so displayed by the consumers of varied states in to which Mark and Spencer made entry.

Being a car manufacturer, the company makes purchases of various ingredients that are needed in the production of vehicles and the entire purchasing of raw materials for the car manufacturing process is the responsibility of Holden Global Purchasing & Supply Chain.

In case of modified rebuy, the buyer feels the need for evaluating alternatives for purchase decision in order to make better purchase decisions, and finally, in respect to new task, an extensive search of new information is required to make buying decision. The buyer in this case lacks information about the products and need completely newer information to make sound buying decision (Morris, Pitt and Honeycutt, 2001). In respect to the raw materials as purchased by Holden Australian in manufacturing vehicles, almost all of them can be classified as straight rebuy because they are purchased in raw forms and designed as per the models of different vehicles at the manufacturing site of Holden. The raw materials such as chassis, body exterior, electrical systems and PCRM are needed in case of all kinds of vehicles and since they are acquired in raw form, they does not need new information in making the buying process.

As for instance, in managing the relationships with suppliers, firms can consider for adopting the strategy of tier-1 supplier whereby the focus would be on managing relationships with few key suppliers that accounts for major proportion of supplying the raw materials and component parts to companies. As in case of Holden Australia, it has been identified that there are few key suppliers of the company including Hett Pty Ltd, Futuris, Tenneco and Hirotec. Thus, the strategy that the company should consider in managing its relationship with these few key suppliers is that of tier-1 supplier relationship which asserts for maintaining long term relationship with these few suppliers. This strategy allows for effective sharing of information with the key suppliers and this in turn allows for better meeting out the customer demands.

Another major strategy as available for automobile manufacturers in enhancing the relationships with their suppliers are through developing Automotive eXchange Network (AXN) which is an important tool in linking automobile manufacturers with several thousand suppliers. In case of automobile companies such as Holden Australia, they usually have many suppliers for the necessary raw materials and component parts in manufacturing vehicles and maintaining relationships with all of them is important and also difficult.

There are various strategic tools available to companies in performing the development of long lasting relationship with customers. One such relationship management tool as available is customer relationship management (CRM) that allows the companies in delivering personalised services. As in case of Holden Australia, the analysis revealed that the company mainly sells its vehicles to final consumers through its strong authoritative dealer\u2019s network and the customers\u2019 satisfaction level is measured through purchase and delivery survey (PDS) and service satisfaction survey (SSS). However, the enhancement of relationship with the final customers can be performed through applying the strategy of customer relationship management. The company can utilise its technological tools in storing customer information and they can therefore be offered with personalised services. CRM enables the company in storing the information of its customers which in turn allows for the identification of the demand patterns of customers (Kincaid, 2003). Since, in case of automobile companies, the customers are required to undergo maintenance services for their vehicles with the company on regular basis, it provides a good opportunity in enhancing the relationships with their customers. Thus, Holden Australia can encourage its dealers to perform higher level of interaction with the customers in order to identify their viewpoints and suggestions which can be integrated to provide them highly satisfied services.", "Thus, through the application of information technology, Holden Australia can ensure the effective flow of information across its suppliers and customers and this in turn allows for the effective accomplishment of organisational objectives.", "In this report, a critical evaluation of the management of relationships with suppliers and customers is performed in respect to Holden Australia and it has been evaluated that the task of maintaining relationships with the customers and suppliers is crucial for the company in achieving its core goals of providing high quality and innovative vehicles.

So we can say that sales team formation is inclusive of tasks which aim at identifying people with such skills and at the same time procuring them and training them further in this direction. The role of sales team is not only limited to convince the consumers but at the same time they are supposed to execute the strategy which has been formulated by the top management. The role of sales team development is to be carried out in a way that will lead to development of group cohesiveness and team spirit in spite of all the competitiveness they share (Bakan 2004).", "The management is required to acquire right type of people and at the same time appropriate mechanism of resource allocation will also help. The next aspect to be discussed in this case suggests that setting targets for performance is also an essential management perspective. There is interplay of several phenomenon\u2019s in this case such as motivation of the employees, setting the key performance indicators as well as there is also need for identifying the type of people so right type of leadership practice can be implemented on them. At this point of time the role of personality types is quite essential as this allows identifying that the management needs to use hard management or soft management techniques to manage the people (Burritt \u00a01997).", "There are several tools with which performance targets can be set and one such tool which is popularly used by managements is the MBO. MBO stands for management by objective and it is believed to be great tool in setting performance targets because in this mutual inputs from both the superiors as well as the role occupant are obtained. Both the manager as well as the employee tends to outlay the objectives which are to be met in a certain course of time. This suggests that both have to mutually agree on what needs to be done. There is no need for imposing work on the employees and instead they are provided with an opportunity to select the objectives matching their skills. This increases both the productivity as well as efficiency of the employee and the company too (Bandura, Caprara and Zsolnai 2002).", "There is one more management practice and it talks about launching a new product line and opening or closing a branch. Both these activities require management governance as they are associated with new event and nothing is predetermined bout the results. The target audiences are supposed to be convinced about the changes in the product line and they must be encouraged to accept the changes. The quality plan is also a form of management activity in which the company plans about the quality related issues in an extensive manner so that quality related defects can be reduced as well as the quality can be enhanced at the same time. The next management practice is of risk management and it can also be termed as contingency mapping or proactiveness of the company. In the highly turbulent business environment where the world has become a boundary less global village there are several risks which are to be administered by a company. There is need for a secondary plan of action and it must be taken into account by top management. Some other management practices which a company undertakes in the long run are social media management, career development, training, bullying, shift work or rostering. In the next section of this business report the stakeholder management practices of Coca Cola will be discussed (Beck 1993).", "As described above there are several management practices in the purview of company operation but still only stakeholder management has been emphasized for specific discussion. The reason is much more active participation of stakeholders in the company operations as well as more empowerment given to them under the influence of two strike rule. The aspect of stakeholders is very vast and there are no second thoughts about the fact that it is essential for the firm to respond to the needs and wants of the stakeholders. The term stakeholder is an umbrella term and it accounts for several entities such as the company employees, consumers, shareholders, suppliers, sellers and many others. Pertaining to all these entities there are several needs and demands which are to be fulfilled on part of a company or else it will become obsolete in some time (Azzone, Brophy, Noci, Welford and Young 1997).", "This aspect of the organization becoming obsolete might seem harsh but it is a reality in line with the two strike rule. This rule empowers the shareholders in an extensive manner that they have the capability to re-elect the board of directors as well as they can transform the whole constitution of the organization. At Coca Cola stakeholder management is believed to be the key for company success. The most essential element of stakeholder management at Coca Cola is open dialogue with a wide-range of external as well as internal entities. The company firmly believes that the stakeholders are to be managed efficiently because they will lead the company policies in a positive direction such as respecting the human and workplace rights. The approach of continuous and open dialogue with the entities will help the company in dealing with all the potential issues that too in a proactive and collaborative manner (Burritt, Hahn and Schaltegger 2002).", "The Coca Cola Company tends to take key inputs form both the experience they have as well as the expertise they have gained in stakeholder management over a period of time. The first and foremost essential aspect to be mention in reference of stakeholder management suggests that there is need for passion to derive knowledge about the needs and demands of various stakeholders associated with the company. This will lead to have a clear cut idea of what is essential and what it not. This will help the top management in deciding about the essential activities which are to be performed in the scope of company activities (Cerin 2002).", "At Coca Cola this is believed to be the mantra of stakeholder management and this reason being the company is constantly involved in the process of designing robust approaches to respect human and workplace rights. In addition with this it is also important to mention that all the parties of company interest are to be included in the purview of private, public and non-profit and labour relations. The sustainable impact of the company can be enhanced with effective shareholder management. The recommendations for further improvement will be mentioned in next section.", "It is to be mentioned at this point of time that management of company practices is essential in one way or the other and out of all the management practices listed above the stakeholder management is crucial for organizational sustainability. At this point of time it is also be concluded in line with this discussion so carried out above that all the management practices are interlinked with each other and any of them cannot be exercised in isolation from other.", "The concerned organization, Coca Cola, is keen in the process of stakeholder management but at this point of time there is need for certain recommendations. The very first recommendation to be mentioned at this stage states that the company must maintain brand image in spite of the categorization of the products. This will not only help the company to deal with competition in the external environment as well as will also help the company to deal with the internal weakness too. The second recommendation to be stated at this point of time states that the needs and demands of the stakeholders are to be identified as well as constantly updated so that there is no confusion or ambiguity about the whole scenario. If these recommendations are to be followed by the company in a comprehensive manner then the prospect of stakeholder management will be managed efficiently.", "Table of Contents", "Disclaimer: The reference paper provided by Australian Assignment Help should be used as a model paper, and are not intended to be submitted to the universities.

The primary activities mainly imply the inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics and sales and service to customers. An analysis of the case of Woolworths indicate that the sourcing strategy as adopted by the company is aimed at achieving sustainable performance conditions whereby the company adapts local food sourcing strategy in order to ensure development and growth of local firms. This strategy of locally sourcing food is aimed at supporting the local producers and its purchasing process also indicates that it supports sustainable development. The products as sources are being processed and they are sold under the Woolworths brand across the shelves of the company in its supermarkets (Woolworths Local Food Sourcing Strategy, 2014).", "These primary activities are supported by a large range of support activities of the company in terms of highly skilled human resources across the country, strong IT infrastructure condition and also the supporting supply chain systems as carried out across the organisation. The analysis of the people at Woolworths indicates that the people are at the heart of its business, and there has been specific culture and strategy that has been followed at Woolworths in supporting its customers. The company has a long term commitment to building internal capability and as a part of its commitment, it employs diverse people within its employee database. There has also been the provision of training for its employees that has been ensured by the company which contributes positively in accomplishing its strategic goals within the industry (Culture and Strategy of Woolworths, 2014).

However, an effective understanding of external environment can become possible through undertaking PEST analysis which stands for political, economical, social and technological factors. The external environmental factors have direct bearing on the performance of the firm and the strategies and tactics as adopted by them are highly influenced by the external environmental conditions (Henry, 2008).

The political factor implies the interventions created by government in the form of policies and procedures mandated for a particular industry. In respect to airline industry, the role of political factor is significant as the government performed intervention through deregulating the industry. The deregulation of the airline industry during 1990s has resulted into higher level of competition among the existing players which in turn has affected the performance of airlines across the world.

Apart from this, the financial crisis has also given rise to the fuel prices and the airlines have to increase the travelling fares to cope up with the rising fuel prices. The rise in the fuel prices has necessitated airlines to indulge into hedging practices in order to negate the impact of rising fuel prices.

Technology is quite effective to the airline industry in terms of allowing the airline operators to keep the cost of their services distribution at lower level.

In respect to the Qantas power, it is lower because of other major airlines in the industry such as Virgin Airlines etc.", "Threat of Substitute: In respect to the threat of substitute is concerned, it is lower in respect to airline industry because air travelling mode is the faster way of availing travelling services at longer distances which could not have been possible from road or water transport. As such, the threat of substitute is lower.", "Rivalry among Existing Firms: This has been crucial in respect to the airline industry in Australia, as the current situation implies that Qantas is competing directly with Virgin Airline in the domestic market, and the competition is so severe that these airline companies are suffering losses in their operations.", "Threat of New Entry: In respect to the threat of new entry, it has been lower in the industry mainly because of the fact that newer players require huge investment in infrastructure in setting up an airline company which would be difficult to perform (Aulenbach, 2007).", "The competitive scenario in respect to the airline industry is significant as each and every airline operator is competing against each other with a view to acquire the market share of others. An analysis of the airline industry especially in respect to Qantas airline indicates that the most significant competitor of Qantas is mainly Virgin Airline. These two airlines are competing against each other and the competition is mainly evident in terms of price cuts for their services. The most astonishing factor in respect to their performances is that both these airlines are sustaining losses and despite that, they are competing against each other for the purpose of achieving higher level of market share (Virgin, Qantas battle for business travellers, 2014).", "The competitive scenario presently across the industry has been extremely bad and this is causing significant amount of loss to Qantas. The industry condition is already not good, as there has been a decline in the number of passengers and at the same time, such highly competitive environment conditions is further affecting the airline industry significantly. The competitive scenario is not only evident in respect to the domestic markets, but Qantas is faced with significant level of competition from the international airline players such as Air Asia, British Airlines, Ryanair, Southwest Airlines etc. This indicates that the competitive conditions are extremely bad in respect to both the domestic market as well as international markets, and as a result, the industry leader such as Qantas is suffering losses in its operations (Virgin, Qantas battle for business travellers, 2014).", "The analysis of strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats in respect to Qantas is performed as follows:", "Strengths: The major strength available with Qantas is its highly reputed brand as it is known as the flagship airline company based in Australia.

The analysis of the weakness of Qantas further indicates that the management of the airline is not that efficient which has resulted into failing strategy of the company.", "Opportunities: The major opportunity available to Qantas is mainly the ability of the airline to further tap the growth opportunities as available in the industry. The only major action needed on the part of airline is mainly with regard to the alteration to its strategies in achieving growth opportunities (Shaw, 2012).", "Threats: In terms of threats are concerned, the major threat to Qantas is the higher competition level especially from Virgin Australia in the local market.", "An analysis of the strategic position of Qantas Airline indicates that it has been positioned as the leader airline company based in Australia. It is best known as the provider of quality air travelling services to its customers, but in the recent years, the company has sustained huge losses, and at the moment, it is losing more than $87 per second. This indicates that the strategic position of being the most suitable company is changed and the airline is now struggling to sustain its operations. As per the claims by public at large, it is the managerial inefficiency by Allan Joyce that contributed towards such ineffectiveness with respect to its strategic positions. In terms of market attractiveness, it is not very good in respect to the Australian domestic airline industry because there has been a sharp decline being witnessed with respect to the number of passengers choosing the air travelling companies for their travel. Thus, the market attractiveness in the short run is not that efficient (Qantas announces record $2.84 billion loss in full year results, 2014).", "An analysis of the market segmentation in respect to airline industry indicates that it is mainly segmented on the basis of percapita income of the travellers. As for instance, the people with higher income can select the premium class air travelling services as provided by Qantas, whereas people can also select low cost air travellers in availing services. This suggests that the market for airline is segmented based on premium class air travelling services and low cost business model", "In terms of market opportunities in respect to airline industry is concerned, the current marketing opportunities is not that efficient in the sense that there has been a decline being witnessed in the number of passengers over the last few year which has adversely affected the performance of airline operators.

In achieving the growth strategy in a most effective manner, this strategic business plan considers the marketing strategy of the company that would enable it to achieve higher growth in those markets. In addition to this, the strategic marketing plan will also consider about the target market strategies and the appropriate marketing mix strategies as well, as the demands of customers from courier service providers is different because of availability of wide variety of services in such market. The strategic marketing plan will also consider about the marketing mix strategy in pursuing higher growth and also about the budget factor which is very crucial for achieving success in the growth strategy of the organization (Lamb, Hair and McDaniel, 2008).", "From the assessment of situation analysis of TNT express as performed, the marketing strategy that would be considered as highly effective for the organization is to adopt a growth strategy, so that the opportunities as seeking by the company in terms of continuous expansion in the growing markets can be achieved.

As a result, TNT can achieve higher growth in its existing European markets by way of its broad product portfolio and paying attention to its customers (TNT Express press pack, 2009). The uncovered European markets have been selected for the growth strategy because the major competitors of the company occupy a major proportion of markets share in the European markets. For instance, DHL occupies 16% market share, UPS has 9% and La Poste of France has 7%. There are numerous emerging European economies which have also to be included in the growth strategy of the company, as these include Moldova, Albania, Belarus, Macedonia etc. Thus, by way of leveraging its advantage of broad product category, company can achieve higher level of success in these markets, as they reflect the availability of huge market opportunities. The competitive intensity in these markets is lower for TNT express, as it is the market leader and majority of the share in the distribution services rests with small players. Further, the company has better access to these markets, as it has started building its new road services since 2009.

There has been a significant growth opportunities for B2C markets for the company as revealed by its market analysis and hence, it should target the B2C customers in its target market for effectively achieving its mission. Thus, the basis for the target market and the target segments selected is the huge growth opportunities available in such markets and also the huge demands for B2C services by the company (TNT Express, 2012).", "The selection of target market should be followed by the adoption a well positioning strategy so that the company can position itself in a most effective manner among its target customers.

For instance, it should position itself as the fast distribution services providers as per the needs and requirements of its customers in a cost effective manner. In case of B2B category of business segment, TNT offers a wide range of products and services to its customers such as 9:00 Express, 10:00 Express, 12:00 Economy Express, Same day delivery services and many more (TNT Express press pack, 2009). These services are core to the success of B2B services of the company and hence, company should integrate all the services for its B2C customers in the selected target market and positions itself as the customized service providers as per the needs of its customers. In addition to this, TNT express should also position itself as the cost efficient providers of parcel distribution services, as the situation analysis indicates that cost is given higher emphasis by customers in the distribution industry. Thus, the positioning strategies of the company should be to position itself as speedy and cost efficient provider of parcel and packages across different regions for both the B2C and B2B customer groups (Hooley and Graham, 2008).", "Strategy Summary", "On the basis of performance of environmental analysis of the company, it has been identified that the corporate strategy of the organization should be market development. As the company already occupies the market leadership position in B2B markets, it needs to develop other European markets for its document handling business by way of building road express services. Hence, the primary corporate strategy of the organization should be to achieve diversification.

In case of documentation industry, the role of pricing decision is crucial and as such, the courier companies should aim at reducing their pricing impact for their document shifting services. In case of TNT express, the company should consider its road express services for delivering its document handling services instead of considering airline route, as it would be highly costly. Thus, the primary strategy of TNT express should be to reduce its cost in expanding its B2B and B2C services in other European markets, so that it can provide its documentation services at reasonable rates (Foxall, 1981).", "Place:\u00a0", "The selection of place is of utmost importance in expanding business operations to newer markets.

The company should implement more intensive marketing campaign with huge investments should be made on a wide range of media for promoting its documentation service inauguration in newer European markets. Since the strategy of the company also includes the consideration of B2C customer segments, the existing promotional strategies should be completely altered and new promotional strategies should be followed for promoting the growth as planned by the organization. The company should make use of its websites for promoting its expansion, as it provides tracking facility to its customers, which leads to higher number of customers accessing its websites on regular basis. As a result, the promotion of its expansion strategies through its website would be highly effective (Sengupta, 2005).", "Physical Evidence:\u00a0", "The role of physical evidence in case of service firms is extremely crucial, as the customer looks for physical evidence in order to judge the quality of services provided by the firm. As in case of TNT services, it can provide a sense of physical evidence to its customer by developing a separate website for its new target market so that customer can collect all the information about the services of the organization from its website.

The performance of evaluation task can be possible through considering a range of metrics. For instance, the most important way of measuring the performance of strategic decision is to measure the revenue generated from the growth strategy as undertaken. In case of TNT express, the revenue from its B2B as well as B2C business segments need to be measured for the newer business locations and the attainment of expected revenue from its newer operation would mean that the company has taken a correct decision of expansion in the various areas of European regions. The non attainment of desired performance would require actions for identifying the areas that need attention and necessary strategies need to be taken to achieve desired level of performance.", "Appendix 1", "Situation analysis is a marketing tool that helps in the assessment of situation that the business is facing.

The safety issues with food products are not only a major problem across Australia, but it is evident in respect to all the major parts of the worlds. There is a growing trend among people to spend on food items outside their home, and this has given rise to the concept of ready- to-eat meal concepts, junk food or home replacement meals. This has resulted into challenges in relation to food safety risks and ultimately, the cases of people suffering from foodborne illnesses are on the rise (Rowell, Binkley, Alvarado, Thompson and Burris, 2013).

These factors pose significant level of risks to the community in terms of their health performance, and thereby necessitate stronger policies in order to deal with these issues. As cited in the paper of Smith and Riethmuller (2000), Riethmuller and Morrison (1995) have indicated the major reasons for food safety issues.

Consumer expects good quality of foods, but the lack of appropriate hygienic measures on the part of food service providers has contributed towards the rising cases of foodborne illnesses across Australia. A study by Martin et al (2003) indicates that despite having a national food safety regulatory system in Australia, there is numerous concerns in relation to food safety issues as faced across the country. Such national food regulatory system is aimed at reducing inconsistencies and inefficiencies with state legislation, reducing the cost of food regulation and foodborne illness. The existing requirements look ineffective in terms of reducing the growing burden of foodborne illness as identified in the study.", "This ultimately necessitates the need for proactive measures that can be applied in order to deal efficiently with the food safety issues across Australia and as such, this research seeks to analyse the ways in which the rising threats of food safety and ultimately illness among the consumers can be reduced.", "In performing this project, the methodology that will be followed, will be an analysis of the findings of past researchers regarding the measures in dealing with the food safety issues and a survey with the customers that have a regular habit of eating outside their home.

There are various ways through which the customer orders can be stored in a positive manner including the details of their specification. The better way of recording customer requests leads to lower overall chances of doing rework (Brown, Gatian & Hicks, 1995).", "However, in the given\u00a0 case of products running over budget at the fast food retail chain stores, it is not because of the mismatch between the customer requirements or specification as provided by them, rather it is mainly because of loopholes on the part of existing employees responsible for producing the required customer orders. However, the customer requirements can be better stored in an efficient manner by way of considering the appropriate information systems in place. The information system can be utilised whereby a separate directory can be maintained with respect to the customer requirements. This system will require the contractual customers to fill up a form whereby they need to enter the details of their orders, and they will then be entered over the information system and a print out will finally be provided to the customers so that the chances of errors in the process are minimal (Barua, Kriebel & Mukhopadhyay, 1995).", "In this way, the information systems can be utilised with a view to record the customer requirements so that there are lower overall chances of rework to the process, and the customers would be satisfied with the specifications as provided by them. Although in the given case, it is not because of any such misplacement of customer orders, rather it is because of some confusion within the organisational employees that has resulted into the delivery of products running over-budget. However, such information systems can be utilised in assisting the organisational employees in better delivering customer requirements. This is mainly in the sense that a printout copy of the customer orders with detail specification of their orders will be provided to the employees responsible for delivering the final consumers, and this will ensure the better overall preparation of fast food items as per the customer specification (Carysforth and Neild, 2000).", "Thus, the application of information system will benefit the employees because it will enable them in identifying the processes that needs to be carried out including the areas where higher emphasis is required. In this way, the information system could be utilised in dealing with the customer requirements in a better way.", "QFD house of quality is a diagram that is mainly utilised for the purpose of defining the relationship between customer desires and the firm/product capabilities. This is an important diagram that explains about the customer requirements and the ways in which the organisation is going to meet out their requirements. It is similar to that of a house and the correlation matrix is at the roof, customer wants and the product features are included within the main parts and the competitor evaluation at the porch. The main belief as per this house of quality is that the designing of products should be performed in order to reflect customer desires and tastes (Cohen, 1995). This implies that the matrix is aimed at satisfying the needs and requirements of customers through including their expectations in it.", "A QFD house of department has been developed above and it indicates about the priority areas and the areas of conflicts in the service delivery process to the final consumers. The analysis above has indicated that the priority areas are mainly the fulfilment of consumer demands on time, and ensuring that the contractual order as undertaken should be completed on time. However, in respect to these priority areas, the conflict of interests as identified is the inability to meet out the demands of consumers and this might be because of the inefficiency on the part of the employees of the fast food retail chain stores.", "The analysis above indicates that the main products as offered by the fast food retail chain store is mainly a range of fast food items and beverages and these products as offered by the company are directly related to the certain major cost categories. As for instance, the consumption of fast foods is directly related to a range of health related problems and this has been the major cost factor associated with their consumption. The quality of such fast food items therefore needs to be of superior quality so that the cost related factor would be minimum. Apart from this cost category as related to the product quality at the given fast food retail chain store, there are certain other cost categories that are further associated to it. As for instance, it is mainly the negative reputation of the firm from not meeting out the contractual obligations of the customers on time and this may therefore adversely impacts the overall reputation of the firm. The task of building positive brand requires huge level of efforts and cost to be incurred by the company, and the given case of not performing the contractual obligations of customers therefore requires the consideration of additional costs being incurred by the company. In further achieving the quality of its products and services offerings, it is highly essential that additional costs need to be incurred by the company for better results.", "The timely meet out of the future obligations is highly essential for the organisation and this requires the consideration of certain major input, quality, output and the outcome performance measures that needs to be considered. As for instance, the input as needed to be considered in ensuring the timely meet out of future obligations include the consideration of 100% efforts on the part of each and every employee, and there should be strict penalty system that should be enforced in achieving higher quality levels. Apart from this, another major input as needed is mainly to make it sure that there should be a provision for additional employees that should be considered by the organisation because this would ensure the meet out of any such contingencies in the form of delays in an efficient manner. This would although enhance the budget to a certain extent, but it would be an efficient strategy in timely meeting out the customer needs.", "In ensuring the maintenance of sufficient quality levels, it is highly essential that there should be adequate emphasis that should be played over recruiting quality staffs that can meet out the organisational requirements in a positive manner. The quality factor can be positively accomplished through making arrangements for the employees that are expert in producing fast food items. The output as a result of making the provision for additional employees and highly quality fast food preparers would result into the better overall satisfaction of customers from the offerings as made by the organisation. The outcome performance measure in meeting out the future organisational need therefore implies that there should be the additional consideration of important resources and at the same time, information systems should also be positively utilised in tracking the progress as made by organisation. This would ensure the efficient accomplishment of the desired outcomes from the products and services as offered by the organisation (Wetherly and Otter, 2008).", "Conclusion", "In this assignment task, a critical analysis of my organisation i.e. fast food retail chain store has been performed with respect to a contractual obligation that has been although accomplished on time, but it is performed over-budgetary mark. The conduct of the analysis revealed that the timely and within cost delivery of the final products to the customers is an essential prerequisite for a fast food retail chain store, and at the same time, they need to maintain good quality of the products and services as being offered. As in the given case, it is recommended that the fast food retail chain store can achieve the timely meet out of customer satisfaction by way of making provision for highly quality and talented staff, and also through considering sufficient number of additional staffs that could be utilised in meeting out any kinds of emergencies during the process. Apart from this, there should also be higher level of use of information technology systems in performing the monitoring or tracking of progress within such system.", "Table of Contents", "Disclaimer: The reference paper provided by Australian Assignment Help should be used as a model paper, and are not intended to be submitted to the universities.

An analysis of the TQM concept indicates that it is mainly concerned with the quality aspects within organization as it focuses on attaining higher quality and effectiveness in the processes that are carried out. TQM is basically utilized by organizations as a management philosophy with a view to provide customer with quality products and services through achieving higher effectiveness within the current business practices. The study by Ooi, Lin, Teh and Chong (2012) indicated that TQM plays an important role in allowing organizations in achieving competitive advantage over others. This is the reason leading to more and more organizations considering the application of TQM practices in performing their business processes. Total Quality Management as the name suggests is concerned with the attainment of quality in the existing business processes so that it leads to overall efficiency and better delivery of products and services to final consumers.", "The role of TQM is not only identified as important in respect to manufacturing organizations, but the study as conducted by Bon and Mustafa (2013) revealed that the role of TQM is significantly higher in the context of service organizations as well. The growing importance of service sector and the increasing level of demands of high quality services among customers have necessitated businesses to focus more on the quality aspect and this has therefore increased the importance of TQM in respect to service organizations as well. The importance of TQM in service industry is similar to that of manufacturing industry as suggested by Bon and Mustafa (2013) as they have indicated that TQM allows businesses within service sector to perform the integration of organization objectives and functions in order to satisfy the customers and thereby in increasing competitive advantage. The need for quality is therefore identified as crucial for the businesses to survive and this can be positively accomplished by focusing on TQM (Bon and Mustafa, 2013).", "However, as indicated by Prajogo and Sohal (2006), in today\u2019s competitive environment, it is essential for the organizations that they should pursue more complex dimensions of performance in respect to both the innovation and quality. This suggests that apart from focusing towards quality aspect, it is also essential that businesses should focus towards attaining innovation in their existing business process, so that the customers can be served with most innovative products and services and better overall satisfaction level within them can be ensured. Businesses are increasingly seeking for attaining innovation in their production process because of higher level of competition. The companies with innovative approach in performing their processes have competitive advantage over others.", "A study by Singh and Smith (2004) indicates that the globalization of businesses has resulted into intense level of competition and this leads to both the multinational and domestic companies are competing against each other for higher market share.

By attaining higher quality in their business processes, it can be possible for them in achieving significant improvements in their profitability, productivity and competitiveness. This has resulted into many businesses paying significant level of importance in attaining higher quality in their business processes.", "However, an important question in respect to TQM and the concept of innovation is whether there exist a direct linkage between TQM practices and innovation. The study by Ooi, Lin, Teh and Chong (2012) indicates that the link between TQM and innovation has stirred up huge interest among scholars in the management field and there are various forms of arguments that are noted in respect to the association between TQM and innovation. As a result, this research is mainly focused towards identifying the exact level of association between TQM practices and the innovation as performed within organization. In particular, the analysis in the given research is mainly based on TQM practices such as management commitment, employee involvement and customer focus and their impact on innovation.

TQM has been defined by Pike, Barnes and Barnes (1995) as a corporate business management philosophy which implies that the business goals and customer needs are inseparable. Its application is mainly evident in respect to both industry and commerce. The concept of TQM mainly involves the attainment of quality in respect to all the processes that are carried out within organization so that it will lead to the promotion of excellence, prevent errors and ensure that each and every business activity is aligned to customer needs and the goals of the business is also advanced properly without any duplication of waste of effort. TQM is all about commitment from all levels within organization and it is mainly a continuous improvement process whereby enhancement over the quality can be attained through ensuring the total quality is integrated as a continuous process. Every department, function and process needs to be integrated and there should be active involvement of all the employees in meeting out customer needs (Pike, Barnes and Barnes, 1995).", "The concept of TQM is also defined by Rawlins (2008) by indicating the concept can be better understood through considering the individual components of TQM. As for instance, Total within TQM means the inclusion of everyone within the organization in the development of final product or service for the customers. Quality component within TQM indicates that it is concerned with meeting out the requirements of the customers. For this to happen, it is essential that the quality requirements must be clearly stated, understood and quantifiable. The term management within TQM has two meanings as firstly, it implies that TQM process has to start from the top and secondly, management implies a continuous process. Implementing TQM philosophy requires management to monitor its application on continuous basis so that the goals of higher quality in the final products and services can be accomplished (Rawlins, 2008). According to Allen (2004), TQM is a philosophy that requires the involvement of the total organization in improving all aspects of the quality of service. The basis definition of TQM therefore indicates that TQM is a process of continuous improvement with a view to deliver better quality of products and services to final customers (Allen, 2004).", "As far as the importance of TQM is concerned, the existing literature indicates that it is highly essential for businesses to incorporate TQM philosophy in the existing business processes. The importance to TQM to businesses is explained by Agus and Hassan (2011) in their study on enhancing production performance and customer performance through TQM. As per the findings in the study, it has been evaluated that in the past two decades, there are various important organizations that have performed the implementation of TQM, and this high quality strategy has resulted into the attainment of competitive advantage to them. The study is mainly focused towards analyzing the TQM impact on customer performance and production performance and the conduct of the study leads to conclusion that there is a positive correlation that exists between TQM and production and customer performance. This suggests that the enhancement over the organizational performance can be achieved through integrating TQM practice (Agus and Hassan, 2011). According to Kaser (2010), businesses today face a market environment whereby meeting out customer needs and requirements is vital to them. The increasing expectations of customers from products and services because of their rising income levels, technological advancements and highly saturated markets have necessitated businesses to focus more towards the quality aspect. This requires them to integrate TQM philosophy in order to efficiently manage quality in performing their business processes (K\u00e4ser, 2010).", "Thus, the analysis revealed that TQM is a management philosophy that aims at achieving continuous improvement in terms of overall quality of business processes, and it is highly important for businesses in the 21", "st", "\u00a0century in effectively satisfying their customer requirements.", "TQM Practices within Organization:\u00a0", "There are various important ways in which TQM practices can be carried out or encouraged within organization. The important areas that need attention in successfully practicing TQM within organization include management commitment, employee involvement and customer focus. A study by Ugboro and Obeng (2000) indicates that the role of management is crucial in performing the successful implementation of TQM philosophy. It is mainly regarded as a management philosophy, and the role of top management is crucial. The top management leadership is the most significant factor towards accomplishing success in respect to TQM implementation. It is the top management leadership that determines the commitment levels on the part of employees, and overall effectiveness of the entire TQM philosophy. The findings from the study suggests that the top management should reflect higher overall level of commitment right from the implementation to management and monitoring of such TQM philosophy in achieving higher level of operational efficiency (Ugboro and Obeng, 2000).", "Apart from management commitment, another important practice needed to focus in the successful implementation of TQM is the employee involvement. A study by Coyle-shapiro and Morrow (2003) indicates that the role of employee involvement is crucial from the point of view of achieving success in TQM implementation. This is mainly because the adoption of TQM by employees is crucial as they determine the overall effectiveness with which TQM principles are integrated and implemented. The study indicated that there are various organizations that performed the implementation of TQM in the past decade and the overall result from TQM implementation has been mixed. However, the major reason as cited for the failure of TQM effectiveness is the lack of overall commitment on the part of employees working in the organization. When TQM initiative does not succeed, the missing element as identified is mainly that the initiative failed to include employee empowerment, or there was lack of training in TQM techniques. This indicates that the role of employee involvement including their empowerment is crucial from the point of view of achieving success with respect to TQM implementation (Coyle-Shapiro and Morrow, 2003).", "The final major element in the process of successful implementation of TQM philosophy is mainly the customer focus. It is highly essential that the main focus of TQM implementation should be customer focus. According to Chary (2009), the focus behind performing the implementation of TQM should be customer focused and the purpose behind implementing TQM should therefore be to improve the delivery of products and services to customers. An improved quality of products and services is likely to enhance the satisfaction level of customers. Complete satisfaction of customers should be the main aim, and the other aim should not confuse this main aim behind implementing TQM. The improvement in the quality of existing organizational processes and systems should therefore be aimed at achieving efficiency and the benefits of which can ultimately be transferred to final consumers. Thus, customer focus orientation of TQM is highly important from the point of view of attaining success in it (Chary, 2009).", "Innovation and Its Importance in 21", "st", "\u00a0Century:\u00a0", "Innovation is another important concept that has higher level of importance within businesses in the 21", "st", "\u00a0century. According to Urabe, Child and Kagono (1998), innovation can be defined as a concept of generation of new idea and followed by its implementation into a new product, process or service and the resulting impact is therefore the attainment of dynamic growth. Innovation is never regarded as a one time idea and it should therefore be practiced on continuous basis. New ideas are highly important because the preference of customers in the 21", "st", "\u00a0century implies that they expect something new from the service providers. This newness in the product and services can be introduced by businesses by way of considering innovation in their processes and practices within organization. Innovation includes both major and minor changes. Extremely major change is identified as radical innovation whereas minor changes are cumulative changes and they are mainly identified as incremental innovation (Urabe, Child and Kagono, 1998).", "With respect to the importance of innovation, it is indicated in the existing literature that it is highly essential to businesses in performing innovation in order to sustain their operations.

Cyber-crime is a serious threat to the financial integrity of an organization or a business. Cybercrime can be defined as an act in which an illegal act is committed by using unauthorized computer access. The culprit gets access to the computer system authorized for someone else and does damage to the system and the data stored in it. It can be said that in this type of crime, computer users steal the credit card numbers, steal the data from company\u2019s websites, withdraw money from bank accounts, and also make illegal electronic fund transfers. All the above mentioned activities come under the cyber-crime (Grady and Parisi 2006).", "In the current scenario, the number of cyber-crime or breaches in information security in international business and the economy is increasing continuously. Both the public and private sectors are suffering from the cybercrime. The problem of cybercrime not only exists in a nation or two but the almost all nations in the world are suffering from it. Cyber criminal are operating in international business with the help of information technologies and internet. Cybercrime is an emerging crime in international business and economy. Cybercrime has affected the business like telecommunications, banking and finance, transportation, electrical energy, water supply, emergency services, and government services. All these organizations heavily depend on computers to perform their daily operations and to secure confidential data.", "In business organizations help of computers is taken to control the business operations, management and to interact among them. Thus, all the pertinent information of the organization flows through Internet. It can be said that the internet has become a significant tool for the cyber criminals (United States. Congress. Senate, 2010).", "During the past decade, there exists the cyber security threat in the whole of the world. The evident targets of cyber terrorism were those systems that were totally dependent on it and were related to the mass people. Such as infrastructures which include oil and gas distribution, transportation, tele-communication, electric power grids, financial institutions, air traffic and so on. In the year 2000 in February month, popular internet sites such as Yahoo, Datek, Amazon, CNN and many such sites became the target of the cyber terrorism as they faced the attck of Distributed Denial of Service (DdoS). Due to this there were million people who were not able to access the important and necessary services which were provided by these websites and companies. This resulted in heavy monetary loss. There was one more loss to these companies which was declination of the security that was offered and promised by their companies (Bigel and Stuart 2003). The initiation of the cyber attacks can be seen started from the collision of the Chinese fighter aircraft and American surveilance plane. This collission gave rise to the cyber attacks and website defacements between America and China (Keegan & Christopher, 2002). One more example is there where the students of Korean University defaced the Japanese websites because they want to protest the contents of the textbooks published in Japan (Bronk & Chris, 2008).", "The online cybercrime is increasing continuously, which resulted in to loss of consumer trust. In early days, cybercrime is restricted to creating viruses to hack the systems. In the current scenario, cyber criminals hack the systems to harm the business so that they can earn profit. A number of organizations have recognized cyber attacks as a threat to their business. It has been observed that 70 % of the total business firms have ranked cyber crime as a threat ahead of other employee frauds or physical damages to the organization (Doyle, 2011).", "In keeping view the increasing threat of cyber attacks, it is important for the business organizations to tighten their IT security. In case IT security is not strong enough then the sensitive information can be leaked or financial data of the company can be stolen which can cause huge damage to the economy of the organization.", "The cybercrime impacts the business in different ways. The major losses which are suffered by the business organizations are mentioned below.", "Loss of Revenue", "The main impact of the cybercrime on an organization is the financial losses for the organization. The loss can be caused by cyber criminals by stealing financial information of the organization. The financial information can be used to make illegal profits from the organization. It also happens when an organization works on e-commerce model, in this model the income of the consumers is lost when they are not able to access the site hijacked by cyber criminals (Kshetri, 2010). According to a recent survey conducted internationally, the business firms across the globe suffering from financial losses due to cyber crime. The Hi-tech crime has cost international economy huge losses in recent years. The tools used by cyber criminals are sophisticated and businesses and governments are at risks.", "Cyber crime is also a factor for the negative impact on the economy by causing huge financial losses to organizations. It happens quite often that even after becoming a victim of cyber crime, organizations do not disclose the issue due to fear of social reputation. The cyber crime has served as a hinder in the growth of e-business as people are scared of possible chances of financial losses in the business. It is revealed by the Australian Internet Industry Association that cyber criminals do 5 million attacks a day or 2 billion attacks a year\u00a0 (Security Week News, 2011). It can be concluded that on an average basis cyber criminals or hackers do 35 attacks on the same organization everyday.", "Waste of Time", "Another impact of the cyber crime on business and economy is the waste of precious time. The IT professional in an organization has to devote great portion of their time in resolving cyber crime related issues. Instead of working on some productive and innovative work, the IT department in an organization has to work on handling security breaches and other issues related with the cybercrime.", "Cybercrime can be done at any time and at any location. Authorities charged with investigating it need to spend more time and effort as compared to traditional crimes. It consumes more time to locate and to detect the cyber criminals. For example, the police and other security personnel need to spend time on to find out electronic evidences and also need to deal with cross border issues in tracing suspected cyber criminals. The risk of cyber crime has become a global issue and is now affecting economies of almost all countries.\u00a0 In a survey conducted in Australia, 67% of the respondents said that they have been the victim of the cyber crime in recent time (Coleman, 2003).", "Damaged Reputations", "The cyber crime also results into harm to the public reputation of the company. In case hackers get access to the confidential data of consumers associated with an organization, the company loses their trusts for the future association. In this situation, consumers start looking for other available alternates, hence the company losses the businesses. It is both legal and ethical liability of any organization to protect the financial and other details of consumers (Lister, 2011).", "Impact on Employee Productivity", "Organizations most often take certain implements some procedures to prevent the incidents of cybercrime. Employees are expected to follow procedures that are essential to prevent cybercrime. In this process the precious time of employees is consumed in following these procedures. The amount of time consumed in following these steps would have been used by employees in performing some productive work.", "The Cyber criminals use a number of tools to breach the security system of organizations. It is extremely important to understand the various methods used for cyber-crime in business organizations. A few of the methods used in cyber crime are discussed below.", "Computer Viruses", "A computer virus can be described as any computer program which is capable of damaging a computer that is replicable. The most of organizations in the world are facing the problem of computer viruses. It has been revealed that in current scenario cyber criminals most frequently use Trojan horses to detect and spy.\u00a0 Trojans are the harmful programs that look like legal software. In fact, it is used for hijack and harms the computer functions in an business organization. Trojans not only harm computers but they also used for some other harmful purposes by cyber criminals. Most of Trojans are equipped with spy ware which is used by cyber criminals to log key strokes, to steal sensitive information of organizations or to get the remote access of the victim\u2019s computer (Wilson, 2008).", "Usually Trojans do not get dispersed into computer systems without external control. This quality of Trojans encourages cyber criminals to target business organizations via email. These e-mails are sent to the employees systems in organizations. These spam e-mails contain infected attachment or a website link. As soon as employees click on these attachments, it downloads malicious code into employees\u2019 computer system.", "The spam mails also have some other threats to users\u2019 computer. Another example of bogus e-mail is phishing. Phishing is bogus e-mails that ask users to share their confidential data. It has been observed that one-fifth of computer users receive around 5 phishing e-mails on daily basis. Phishing e-mails are most often sending to the consumers of an organization. In case consumers share their confidential information in the -email, then there are more chance of them to be victim of cyber crime. Phishing e-mails also damage the public image of an organization.", "In case of phishing, users\u2019 willingness is required to get the users details. Cyber criminals can also hijack computers gains the wish of users. This tactic turns computers into Zombie machine which has the ability to send millions of mails rapidly. In a recent case in Australia, a person creates a Zombie network of 50, 000 computers that resulted into damage of $ 135,000 in a hospital. Computers in the hospital were damaged and including those which were located in the intensive care unit of the hospital. As a result of this, the medical care for patients suffered badly. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one more form computer hijacking. A number of well known websites like Ebay, Yahoo, Microsoft, and CNN have become victims of cyber crimes (Coleman, 2003).", "Malicious Code", "Malicious code is the new Internet threat that cannot be easily controlled by any antivirus. Malicious code is the auto-executable programs which cause damage to the computer system. They take the form of java applets, ActiveX controls, scripting languages, browser plug-ins, and pushed content. If once the malicious code enters the workstation or the network drivers, they can cause damage to it by causing network and mail server overloaded with the email, messages, passwords, document files, steal the data or it can also reformat the files (Lister, 2011). Cyber-criminals create the malicious code to create the cyber-attack or the computer network attack.", "These codes can also generate the malicious packets that could disturb the data and the logic by exploiting into the computer software. It can also weaken the security practices of the organization. This cyber-attack disrupt the reliability of the equipments used in companies and can create the threat on the integrity of the data and confidentiality to the communication network.", "Electromagnetic energy", "Electromagnetic energy is the severe threat to the national security it can be created by two ways; either overheating nuclear burst or the other is microwave emission. It interfaces with the radio frequency and damage the voltage or current in the electronic devices. If the electronic devices are connected with the metal, that could be antenna, its effectiveness increases.", "As infrastructure computer system is interconnected, there is a possibility that it could disrupt the power grid, communication, equipments in hospitals or military communication system. Electro magnetic energy is in the form of electromagnetic pulses, which is the severe threat to the cyber attack, which directly affects the computer equipment or data transmissions by overheating the circuit, jam the communications, create a mark on the reliability of the equipment and integrity of the data.", "Cyber crime is growing at the rapid scale in the international economy and affecting many business organization and economies every day. One attack on the corporation could have many implications on that company; it can lead to financial loss, stock loss, money loss of customers and stockholders. Cyber-crime has affected the global economy, costing billions of dollars. In 2003, USA was affected by cyber-crime at 35.4% and South Korea at 12.8%. Several consulting firms have faced financial loss between $13 and $226 billion, due to viruses, worm attacks and other attacks (Wilson, 2005).", "In the context of the impact of the cyber-terrorism, economies of the countries are greatly influenced. To speed up communication process, many international terrorist groups are using computer networks and internet. Along with this, these groups are developing their technical skills for harming the computer networks of the enemy countries. With the intention of harming the economy of any country, these groups target the computer networks of government agencies and civilian critical infrastructure. All the secret information and records are kept in the computer based system which is targeted to disrupt the entire economy. Recently, Pentagon which secret military centre of the US is attacked by the cyber criminals and entire system was damaged as well as secret information was leaked. In addition to this, when such precious information related to government, military or economic activities leaks in international market then it can deteriorate the image of the country (Wilson, 2008).", "Till date, no economy in the world faced coordinated cyber-attack on its computer network therefore most of the experts argue that cyber-terrorism is not as big threat as biological, chemical and nuclear. Along with this, it is difficult for terrorists to give physical threat to the civilians but as a whole national security of any country can be at stake. When national security is at stake then economic growth of the country is also adversely affected. Economy is based on well-being as well as hard-core efforts of the citizens of any country and if they are not able to put in their best efforts then surely economy will be hurt (Coleman, 2003).", "Results of cyber-terrorism are disruptive and destructive as it damages the computerised critical infrastructure by destroying the electric power grid, telecommunications and internet. Today every sector of economy whether it is manufacturing, service or agriculture is completely based on computer technology and internet and if this system is harmed these sectors of the economy are also directly harmed which, in turn, adversely affect the economy (Security Week News, 2011). Output of these sectors will constantly go down if support of computerised technology is not available for them and the economy slip down in the international market. Computers are used as target or weapons by the politically motivated international or sub-national terrorist groups for spreading fear among the general public to influence the government for changing their policies.", "Survey Data on Cyber-crime", "As per the survey conducted by the computer security institute and Federal Bureau of", "Investigation (FBI) in 2003 on computer crime, 530 U.S firms share their experience of facing computer crime. There is no standard methodology to measure the cost of cyber-attacks or crime. Investigations of stock prices show that target firms suffer losses of 1%-5% in few days after the attack. The shareholder lost between $50 million and $200 million because of drop in the prices at New York Stock Exchange. Computer security consulting firms suffer a substantial loss due to the virus and worm attacks and digital attacks. In 2003, the firms lost from $13 million (worms and viruses only) to $226 (for all forms of overt attacks) (Cashell, Jackson, Jickling and Webel, 2004).", "The insurance industry has also become active to cover the losses from cyber crimes. Earlier, companies did not include cyber attacks from standard business insurance coverage. Several insurers started to sell specialised cyber-risk policies after the initial exclusion.", "The sizes of the firm decide the vulnerability towards the attacks. Conventional firms Refereed to as Brick and Mortar are least affected by the Cyber attacks as they are least dependent on the Internet (Kshetri, 2010). The firms characterized by \u201c: click and mortar\u201d are most affected by the attacks as they conduct business offline and over the Internet.", "IT security spending", "With the increase in the cases of hacking and cyber-crime, greatest economies of the world along with international business organisations are increasing their spending on IT security. It is very difficult to measure the level of risk associated with attacks on the cyber space of any economy hence they simply raise their security spending for ensuring full-proof security. The high budget of IT security is unnecessary burden on the economy of any country which can be spent on any other infrastructure related activity (Doyle, 2011). Along with this, worth of this budget cannot be measured by any of the financial technique like cost-benefit analysis and return on investment (ROI). Therefore, corporate investment policies are also adversely affected by cyber-terrorism.\u00a0 There are various products available which ensure the security of the computerised system which is very expensive for any economy.", "Computers make major contribution in economic activities by increasing the productivity statistics. During the period of 1980s and 1990s, computer industry took a step towards growth but its contribution in economy is negligible. When in the decade of 1990, international economy was accelerated in the productivity growth then contribution of computer industry cannot be ignored. Level of innovation in the memory and speed of the computer also increased which, in turn, increases the acceptance of the computers in the various sectors of the economy (United States. Congress. Senate, 2010).", "Along with this, prices of the computers also went down hence small business organisations also implemented computerised systems in their organisations. Though, computerised system was contributing in cost reduction and speeding up the production activities yet it also increased system\u2019s vulnerability. Now the entire system of the economy can easily fall prey to the hackers. These hackers somehow linked with terrorist groups and target the computer based system to fulfil their political motives. Thus, it can be said that benefits of the computers increased the acceptance of the computers in the economy yet came along with various threats like unwanted access to private and confidential information (Grady and Parisi 2006).", "To protect the computer system and the network are the greatest challenge of the nations and the corporate, business organization. There are few methods of overcoming from the cyber-crime, such as, reducing the surface area, adequate protection, firewalls, content filtering, intrusion prevention system, patch management system and penetration testing and security audit (Wilson, 2008).", "Reducing the surface area", "The organization could adopt the simple security rather than complex security, as complex security cost more to the organization and they could be easily understood. It is true that simple security do not easily become prey to the cyber-attacks.", "Adequate Protection", "The organization should adopt the modern equipments which could provide security solutions to prevent from the Internet attacks. These solutions also cope up with the worms and hackers.", "Firewall", "Firewall is the best security solution, which covers the vulnerable services, which are not exposed to the aggressive networks, such as, internet. Firewall can protect the system from the opportunistic attacks and could limit the attackers. Firewall minimizes the exposure and allows the administrator to focus on the security of various parts of the network.", "Content filtering", "Content filters protect the computer from the viruses by providing the content filter solutions for email, which scans the attachments through anti-virus. It also helps the administrators to detect and block the attacks. Content filters solutions list them executable programs according to their functionality and match them with their signature to identify the attributes of the malicious code and block that code. Filters add the extra layer of protection against virus.", "Intrusion prevention systems", "Administrators detect and block the attacks, with the help of intrusion prevention system. This system does not prevent the attacks rather they stop the attacks by exploring the vulnerabilities. Different types of intrusion prevention systems are present in the market, like, Snort Inline, which is network and host based, another is Microsoft\u2019s DEP introduced with Windows 2003 and XP SP2 (Shalhoub and Qasimi, 2010).", "Patch management systems", "Patch management systems are extremely useful in a corporate environment and at homes, by installing the patch into the system can stop the intrusions which occur due to software bugs.", "Penetration testing and security audit", "To test the security of the computer system, it is essential to conduct the penetration testing. This test is usually performed by the professional or white-hat hackers, which gives the proof that the computer system could be hacked or not. A professional could attack the client system; therefore, it is crucial that the security of the system should be check from time to time, by conducting the penetration test. Penetration tester must identify about the targets in the system on which the attack could be done, by this way, the tester could apply the check system. A report should be generated by the organization about the test performed and security issues should also be highlighted.", "Counter Measures for Cyber terrorism", "At the present time there are no foolproof ways to counter measure cyber terrorism and to protect the systems or businesses and economy.\u00a0 The people who are doing businesses have adopted the system of keeping all their data bases on the computers. There several branches are interconnected with the intranet and in such a case if the system gets attacked by the cyber terrorists, then their business will suffer a lot not only in the present time but in the future also. People who avail their services will have the feeling that this particular organisation does not pay attention on the customer services and then they will switch to some other service provider competitor of the company. Therefore companies adopt a measure of encryption which is very common measure. But the government of some countries banned the use of encryption for the purpose of exportation especially and that is why the communication at the international and intercontinental level was very insecure. The Clinton government and FBI opposed the exportation of encryption technique so that the government can get the key to the encrypted system after the approval of the court order. FBI stated that the internet is a real threat for the security of the people and that it is the duty of the internet police to protect people\u2019s privacy and their right to safety from this threat (Om & Parmar, 2010).", "Some people also promoted the use of firewalls so that all the communication to\u00a0 a system can be screened in which the e-mail messages are also included because e-mails can carry logic bombs also. The system of firewall is a term that is used for the filtering the access to the other networks. Firewalls can be in the form of router or computer or other communication devices which may be in the form of a network configuration. The use of firewalls helps in defining the services and access which are permitted or allowed to every individual user (Om & Parmar, 2010).", "One more method to check the security threats is to screen the requests of the users so that it can be checked that whether the request has come from the previously defined domain or any IP address. Some more methods are there which should be remembered to get protection from cyber terrorism. These methods are as follows-", "there must be a password secured access to all the accounts. It should also be kept in mind that the password should be unusual and that it is not easy to guess the password.", "If the defects in the network configuration are known then the network should be changed.", "There should be some check logs and edit systems so that the intruder can be easily traced or detected.", "It is recommended to the users that if they are not sure about the safety of the site or they receive any kind of mail which seems suspicious to them and which is from an unknown address they should not access the website because it can be troublesome for them to use such unauthenticated website (Om & Parmar, 2010).", "There are several anti terrorism acts passed in Australia. Under the Australian law, the companies and individuals are obliged to ensure that the information that they make available on the internet must not be like that can be used further for the mass destruction program. The above obligation comes under the Weapons of Mass Destruvtion (WMD) which is also known as Prevention of Proliferation Act 1995. it is mentioned under this act that if any goods or services are supplied in or outside Australia, or any goods or technology is exported outside Australia, which do not fall in any other category of the legislation or the services provision of Australia or the services provisions outside Australia, where it comes to a suspicious that these goods or services or technology may assist a WMD program (Ellsmore, 2002).", "However, this kind of situation is not very likely to be seen in the day to day business activities. Australian department of defence has given some examples explaining their point-if a delegation of the foreign company has come to visit Australia for the sole purpose of buying some complicated computer equipments and the equipments that they purchased were of very high technical capabilities which are very helpful in the advance simulation and\u00a0 modelling technique in the computers and if these techniques are also likely to be used in the nuclear or biological or chemical research then it would be harmful for the nation and it will also go against the law (Ellsmore, 2002).", "Conclusion", "From the analysis of the above study about the cyber terrorism and its impact on the business and economy, it can be said that it is one of the worst threats to business and ecnomy in today\u2019s time as it cannot be seen directly that who is attacking and in what form the terrorist is attacking. In such a case it is important that some laws should be made like made by the Australian government that if a person or organisation is transferring any data on the internet it should be taken care that cannot be used in the mass destruction. Apart from this, some measures should be adopted such as firewall, security passwords, encryption of data etc to avoid cyber security threat. With the help of these measures the business organizations and economies would be helped to survive in a secured environment.", "Table of Contents", "Disclaimer: The reference paper provided by Australian Assignment Help should be used as a model paper, and are not intended to be submitted to the universities.
