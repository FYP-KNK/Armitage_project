The results can then be easily tracked, illustrated (through graphs) and reported on in order to have effective statistics to show during an audit.", "However, effective survey results are only as good as the questions asked.

These are:\u00a0", "When developing questions based on these key areas, Smart Surveys also recommend using\u00a0rating scales so that answers can be as measurable as possible. An example of this is asking a student to rate the effectiveness of their trainer from one to five. The organisation can then determine the parameters of this rated scale in order to get an accurate measurement of overall effectiveness; a five could equate to highly effective, a four or three could equate to somewhat effective and a two or one could equate to ineffective.

For example, Why did you give this rating regarding trainer effectiveness? This qualitative information will provide the trainer with a greater depth of information and pinpoint the moment dissatisfaction has occurred during the training delivery. This is crucial as it is from this point an RTO can effectively develop steps to resolve the issue in future. ", "Another important indicator of customer satisfaction which can be applied to surveys is the Net Promoter Score (NPS). This score is based on the fundamental perspective that every company\u2019s customers can be divided into three categories; promoters, passives and demoters.", "Promoters are loyal enthusiasts who keep buying from a company and urge their friends to do the same. Passives are satisfied but unenthusiastic customers and can be easily wooed by competition and detractors are unhappy customers trapped in a bad relationship.", "The thought process behind the NPS concept according to the top management consulting firm Bain & Company, is that a customer (or a student in this context) is likely to be highly satisfied with the service they\u2019ve received\u00a0if they are willing to recommend it to friends (2016).", "Bain & Company also claim that the NPS score is a key way to gauge the efficiency of a company\u2019s growth and overall performance; the more promoters a company has the greater the likelihood of leads (or student inquiries in this context).", "Constructing an NPS survey is very simple and is drilled down to one essential question: How likely would you recommend our company/training course to another student?", "This question would then use a scale from one to ten. Students who rank their answer from one to six would be classed as a demoter, students who rank their answer between seven and eight would be classed as passive and students that rank their answer between nine and ten would be classed as a promoter. Once gathering these answers, the company will calculate the total percentage of each category and then minus the total percentage of demoters from the total percentage of promoters to get the overall NPS score. This is an easily trackable score that an organisation can apply to their overall performance or for a particular course, assessment piece or training team.", "Bain & Company believe that incorporating an NPS element to surveys, as well as standard ranking scales will ensure an accurate insight into the satisfaction levels of customers or students.
