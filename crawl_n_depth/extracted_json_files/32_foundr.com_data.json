How did this all start? We\u2019re here in Melbourne in this incredibly large office. Airwallex has achieved just recently a unicorn status. How did it all start?", "Jack: I\u2019m obviously not naturally born a CEO. But I think I always tried to do different sort of things when I grew up and when I started my career. I probably started more than 10 businesses between sort of 20 to 30 really while having a full-time job. I always had different type of businesses, like importing, exporting, retail, online businesses. And just tried to do different things to see if I\u2019ll achieve something or feel happy about what I\u2019m doing. But really haven\u2019t really found anything I\u2019m really passionate about for a long time before I started Airwallex.", "And Airwallex is the first time that I seriously tried to make something happen. And then it doesn\u2019t make any money. And at least sort of personally in the first couple of years, and then also for the company, which is quite interesting. So, the idea was started from \u2026 While my co-founder running a retail business. And he\u2019s importing a lot of stuff from China, South East Asia that we had to use a payment provider to make imports for the payment, the time taken from making payment, also the cost. It\u2019s around 4% of the transaction at the time, which is quite a big pain point that we had to resolve. We tried West Union, we tried local banks. And we tried a bunch of stuff, nothing that actually worked very well. And because my background is all about technology and foreign exchange trading-", "Nathan: Foreign exchange, your background?", "Jack: Yeah. So, it\u2019s kind of natural for me to find a solution to solve it. And then, that\u2019s how it all started. And I get my CTO and I pull him out of the retail business he was running, the other co-founder, Max. So, three of us kicked off the business. And then, later on we have two other friends join us to officially launch the Airwallex brand.", "Nathan: Interesting. So, you said for eight to 10 years you were doing side hustles on the side, right?", "Jack: Yeah.", "Nathan: But this was the first business that you started that you were truly passionate about the problem that you were solving. What happened for eight years? I\u2019m just curious because that\u2019s a long time to kind of play around.", "Jack: Yeah. I mean, the stuff I was doing is very different to technology stuff, right? I\u2019ve done, for example, I\u2019ve done retail open, especially coffee. That\u2019s really kind of impressional stuff, very tedious sort of impressional work. But there\u2019s a lot of design elements and quality element involved that business has been doing really well and making a decent income.", "And I also have a design architecture firm and project management firm. I also have a real estate development company that generate a lot of profit on the side, you know? 10X my salary. But I never left my full-time job because that\u2019s really just making income. That doesn\u2019t have any technology, doesn\u2019t have any social impact. And I just couldn\u2019t \u2026 Back then, we were thinking we could maybe build a 50 level residential building in the inner city. But I\u2019m not really passionate about the idea. I know we can make a lot of money by doing that, you know? It would take us five to 10 years to get there. And we know we\u2019ll get there. But just never really fill your life while you\u2019re doing that.", "The idea of running a tech driven providing kind of a long-term customer value to our customers is far more satisfied and interested than running a real estate development company. Even that real estate development company from a purely sort of revenue point of view might be a lot more than running Airwallex in the first few years. But running a startup it is a game of scaling, which we think eventually Airwallex will be far more successful and far more impactful and then as a global platform. And that achievements feels a lot more sort of satisfied than running a real estate development business.", "Nathan: Okay. Interesting. I just want to talk about that just a little bit more, if that\u2019s okay. So, I was reading that you\u2019re a solutions architect by trade, is that right?", "Jack: I started with sort of financing. So, I was working in a fund, a hedge fund. And then the investment banking effectuating technology. So, it\u2019s all kind of combination of financing and engineering or developing, writing code and developing trading algorithm and trading platforms to helping either ourself, which is proprietary trading, or helping our customers on the market making side in foreign exchange trading and sort of fixing kind of stuff.", "Nathan: Got you. And all during that time, you were working full-time as a solutions architect, you had other businesses on the side?", "Jack: Yeah.", "Nathan: Yeah, that\u2019s crazy. How come you didn\u2019t go full-time on those? What changed? Was it because you weren\u2019t that passionate about them like that?", "Jack: Yeah, well just I always enjoy technology. I love writing code. And those businesses, I can easily manage outside of my office hours. And I work probably 16, 17 hours a day and seven days a week. So, even working as a side job, I still put in full-time hours in there. You know, working was never a sort of torture to me. It was always building stuff. And I got into real estate because I really like design, design beautiful kind of stuff to the customers. Even that, when I was doing real estate development or project management or design and architecture, the stuff we produce is always very, very different to what you\u2019re seeing on the street. It is something that have a lot of vision in the design. And a lot of things about architecture and living and the customer experience. Whereas, it\u2019s not just purely making money, look at P&Ls and that sort of stuff. Yeah.", "Nathan: Got you. I see. So, you found this problem because one of your friends was doing importing, exporting. I can relate to this particular problem. Like, for us with our company, we charge for products or the magazine or whatever in US dollars, but then it comes back and converts to Australia. We get hit like 4% or whatever with Stripe. And then sometimes we have to buy USD back because we pay a lot of team members in the US. And we have to \u2026 If we use the bank or whoever, you can get between three or four percent on that. And it\u2019s crazy. Even if you use an AMEX, FX it\u2019s-", "Jack: Yeah, you should use us. So, with us, basically you can fire up what we call a global account real time. You can connect that global account with Stripe. So, instead of paying Stripe for the 2.7% for that, you\u2019re just doing the local currency in the US. You\u2019re essentially having an account with US bank details with your name to receive the funds. And you can bring it back to Aussie dollar whenever you want at the interbank rate. And we charge a flat sort of 0.5% on top.", "Nathan: Yeah, it\u2019s crazy because yeah, the money is made with a lot of these companies that do transactions, the money is made \u2026 Yes, they charge a fee, but the money is made in the exchange rate that they give you.", "Jack: Yeah, so we\u2019re usually kind of post our rate, what we call interbank rate, which is basically the best rate you can get at the time, which is transparent kind of around the world. You can get that rate from actually Google finance and Yahoo Finance, all that, as a real exchange rate. And we\u2019re also transparent about the fee that we charge on top, instead of telling you a rate, you just don\u2019t know the difference between that to the interbank rate. We tell you straight away. This is our standard price, it\u2019s 0.5%. And if you become a larger business and you keep scaling, then we might able to give you a better rate, a better sort of fee structure as you\u2019re scaling. And it\u2019s completely free to create the global account in US dollar. You don\u2019t have to actually pay anything if you don\u2019t convert it. You can bring the money back and that\u2019s all free.", "Nathan: Yeah, that\u2019s incredible. So, you came up with this. You found this big problem, which I feel myself is in our company. And you\u2019ve got some friends together, a CTO and you said another friend that had the retail business, yeah?", "Jack: Yeah, so actually he\u2019s sort of taking care of all the operational sort of stuff, customer success.", "Nathan: Okay, and then you kind of work on product, really.", "Jack: Yeah, so product and commercial.", "Nathan: Yeah, okay. And so, what happened next? How long did it take to build the product, the first version of the product?", "Jack: The first version what really kind of go to market, that took about a year to build the first go to market product. That was pretty sort of simple. It was just solving a cross border payment issue. And we covered a few countries and we tried targeting the SME market, but that didn\u2019t really go well because then we only raised like three million dollars in our first round. And building the product already cost a lot of money. Now, we don\u2019t have any money to go to market, you know?", "And then, to build a global network, that required even more money. So, we raised another round, which is 13 million. But that only just enough for us to keep building the product. And then we decide to, instead of pursuing the SME path, we pursuing large opportunities that can bring us revenue growth and volume growth to get scale first. So, we decide instead of kind of promoting our web application, which can just log in and start operating, we built a suite of APIs and really kind of \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say changed the company vision, but really changed the direction of the company at that time from a more sort of user driven, SME driven type of business to become an infrastructure company. And I basically started building the infrastructure, the connectivity. And so far we have built banking connectivity with more than 50 banks around the world to offering a lot more than just a cross border payment.", "We now have global accounts. We have FX. We have market FX. We have lock FX. We have international payment which you can do sort of send funds overseas and you can also do mass payment to many, many countries with our API. We are in the process of launching our acquiring product, which is online payment acceptance to competing with Stripe. And we also are launching our issuing product, which you can doing kind of programmatic more than card issuing to both smaller businesses and also to internet platforms like Uber and Dotdash. So, that\u2019s really become \u2026 Now with the company model from sort of a simple cross border money transfer or collection business to a kind of global platform that touched end to end process of programmatic money movement to more and more become a conveyor of global banking.", "Nathan: I see, yeah. So, you\u2019ve got a few different products now.", "Jack: Yeah.", "Nathan: Yep. So, I\u2019d like to rewind for a second because you mentioned too when you went to market, it was a bit difficult. But you still raised three million dollars to be able to fund the development of the product.", "Jack: Well, that we didn\u2019t even have a product when we raised three mil. So, we had nothing when we raised the three mil. That was just a team we put together and then the business plan.", "Nathan: Yeah. And how did you do that? Like, if this is your first kind of tech startup, how did you \u2026 Because it\u2019s hard, especially here in Melbourne, here in Australia, it\u2019s not that easy. Like, how did you raise-", "Jack: I was lucky enough, I didn\u2019t raise in Australia. I would doubt that I would able to do that in Australia, even today. You know, me and my co-founder, we put in more than a million US into the business. So, that gave us the first sort of six months of runway. Then we raised the actual two mil on top of the one mil. So, it kind of make up the three mil. Really, external investment is two million dollars. That was at a ten million dollar valuation. That was our first round.", "It\u2019s still a big dilution, but we were able to convince the investor. At that time, it just really, we were solving an important issue. And exactly how we\u2019re going to solve it. So, because I\u2019m a product engineer, I can describing the way to solve it very, very clear. But the go to market plan wasn\u2019t clear at that time. I keep sort of describing to the investor how we\u2019re going to go to market. But looking back, what I described, nothing has happened, right?", "So, back then, investor keep asking me, \u201cHow are you going to go to market? How are you going to go to market?\u201d We tried to explain different things. But then, it\u2019s unrealistic looking backwards because that\u2019s my first time doing the startup. But lucky enough, they still believed in the team we had at the time and believed in the company\u2019s vision and believed we are solving something quite important in the global scale. They\u2019re happy to bet on people, basically.", "Yeah, that was a bit of luck as well. And even with our series A, the 13 million, we still haven\u2019t got revenue in anything sort of in scale come in. And just continued building this infrastructure. So, we had to run the company for two and a half years without any revenue to come in purely we rely on raised capital investment.", "Nathan: Wow. Was that scary?", "Jack: Yeah. So, you know, I was telling to my staff that my surviving pressure was sort of three to six months for the first two and a half years. It was just \u2026 Yeah, you always have that less than 12 months runway. You have to raise a decent capital to build the product to scale. But lucky enough after two and a half years, we just went from almost no transaction to now processing billions of transactions a month. So, that sort of 100X growth is just because we have spent so much time on the infrastructure. Even though it takes time to perfect the user experience, that takes iterative research and development. But because of the infrastructure that we have built with all the banks and that becoming a foundation of solving a lot of critical issues, we were able to get a lot of large customers to using our platform, like Tencent and Mastercard, a lot of large sort of internet companies and travel companies and financial service companies that are using our product.", "From the very get go our first customer is Mastercard, right? So, that we can get scale pretty quickly. Obviously it\u2019s a painful process to building a standard of PCI security infrastructure and ticking all the checkbox of RFI, RFP.", "Nathan: Even pitching the right person within Mastercard. Like, convincing them to work with you guys.", "Jack: Yes. And yeah, we got a bit lucky with joining the Mastercard. It was sort of incubating, they call it Star Pass programme. They had a sort of dedicated person to help us navigating such complicated ecosystem within Mastercard. And we were lucky that Mastercard decided to make an investment in us. So, in our sort of 30 minute series A around together with Tencent and Sequoia. That really kind of a game changer for us because we got some of the best investors in the world willing to backing us, even without revenue come in, which is a big deal for us at the time. And we can keep attracting talents into the company, leveraging the brand of Tencent, Mastercard and Sequoia to keep building our global infrastructure to a stage that we can scale.", "Nathan: I see. So, talk to me around the early days getting your first \u2026 You did the seed, the three million. And you said you raised from the US. Who was-", "Jack: That was from some sort of South East Asia and China investor. So, the first round was \u2026 The biggest investor that\u2019s kind of well-known is kind of Gobi Partners. So, Gobi have managing close to a billion dollars probably between South East Asia and China. They\u2019re also managing the Alibaba Entrepreneur Fund out of Hong Kong. The other two are pretty, I guess not famous investors.", "Nathan: Got you. But still, I\u2019m curious to hear, what advice would you have to anybody watching or listening that have a product that is purely disruptive, it can be scaled globally, like Airwallex. And incredible team, incredible vision, they believe that there\u2019s something there, deep problem that needs to be solved. And it\u2019s quite expensive to build the product, and they need to raise capital, what advice would you be giving? Especially first time founders. Like, I think it\u2019s really difficult to raise first time founders. People are looking for people that have failed or have done it before, you know?", "Jack: You know, my personal experience is it\u2019s full of luck, really. But also, we\u2019re putting incredible amount of effort to the business in the first 12 months. Me and my co-founders, we sleep in the office every day. We\u2019re working 20 hours all four of us sort of doing product or coding code. It\u2019s that sort of intensive obsession of what we do is very, very important. So, what I really believe that when you actually put in that amount of effort, there\u2019s potential returns that you may not anticipated. That you\u2019re able to, one kind of that you\u2019re able to genuinely \u2026 When you talk to the investor, they can feel your genuine passion about this such critical important issue you are solving, that owners see that genuine transparency about how you want to solve it. And you can describe it in detail because I actually engineered the entire sort of platform.", "So, I know exactly from here to here to here how exactly step by step it happens. So, I\u2019m describing a problem we\u2019ll be solving in 12 months. But I\u2019m able to articulating exactly how to get there. It\u2019s not like you just tell them, \u201cWe\u2019ll get there in 12 months.\u201d But it\u2019s like, \u201cThis is how it takes. This is the team we\u2019re going to need. This is the solution we\u2019re going to put together. And why this is a such large opportunity. Why is this is such an impactful thing to internet business and to help those businesses to scale globally.\u201d You know, first of all, it has to be a large scale issue, otherwise the investor wouldn\u2019t bet so much money on \u2026 You know, if the market is $100 billion, then they wouldn\u2019t spend that much money on solving $100 billion business because we\u2019re solving hundreds of billions or even a trillion dollar plus sort of market. And that kind of giving the investor room to imagine how big this opportunity could be and why you need a bunch of people with this sort of skill to solve it. And why it\u2019s so important to invest in such things.", "Basically, an early stage investor will take a bet on you, on people. I would say the CEO is the most important person, I would say. Most of my investors who come back, I was talking to Tencent, I\u2019m like looking back, \u201cWhy you would invest,\u201d right? I mean, there\u2019s such a risk, even me thinking back, such a risky decision. And my board of directors from Tencent was laughing. He\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t even know I\u2019m going to invest today to taking such a sort of brave decision because 13 million without revenue is a big investment.\u201d But now in fintech it\u2019s become common. Back then, it wasn\u2019t common at all. Now you get people raising 20 million pre-revenue all the time in the US when you are in the fintech space, because of the regulations, the licencing, there\u2019s regulatory compliance.", "To set up a fintech business in the regulated environment is very different to setting up a normal sort of eCommerce business that don\u2019t have those burdens and it requires a lot of money to do that. Even the licencing, the first licence took us a year to even launch anything.", "Nathan: That\u2019s crazy. So, I\u2019m curious around when it comes to raising enterprise value because you said now it\u2019s not uncommon for a fintech to raise 20 million pre-revenue. But that was only four years ago, right? Like, the speed of growth and scale that you guys have achieved in a short period of time is very impressive. So, one thing that strikes me is you as a founder and CEO, you must be very skilled at raising enterprise value, because I said at the start, you guys are now valued at over a billion dollars. Like, what advice would you give to founders that have raised capital? What things should they be thinking about to raise enterprise value of their company? Because that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, right?", "Jack: I never thought about valuation, to be honest.", "Nathan: Really?", "Jack: Even at this round, I never cared about valuation. My next round is probably the round I\u2019m starting to care about valuation. So, it\u2019s always about what other value they can add to my business. So, that\u2019s why we got Sequoia, Tencent, and Mastercard to invest in us in that series A round. And exactly the same investing advice in the series B and with extra funding from Horizon Ventures and Hillhouse. The value that Hillhouse can bring is going to be massive before we IPO. And Horizon Ventures is the most reputable fund in Hong Kong, which we\u2019re having a lot of business in Hong Kong. So, it\u2019s just a lot of strategy decisions with Visa, Master \u2026 Sorry, Mastercard and Tencent is also a lot of strategic relationship there, not just purely financial investment.", "For example, Mastercard helped me a lot with building the banking connectivity and network. Not saying they would help me do the work, but they just introduced me to the bank CEO, for example, that generally would took a long time to meet those bank CEO. But fortunate enough that I would attend a few conferences with 50, 60 bank CEOs around the world in a single room and presented to them about Airwallex. And they can feel my passion. And then they try to kind of build that sort of connectivity for me. And then, just speed up that whole scaling process because building a banking partnership is a very, very difficult process and could be very slow. But we were able to build more than 50 banks relationship within four years\u2019 time, which is something I haven\u2019t seen in other businesses.", "Nathan: Yeah, I know. It\u2019s incredible. So, you\u2019ve been very strategic with the investment partners that you have brought on because they\u2019ve allowed you, not just from a money standpoint but from a connection and relationship standpoint add value to the product, which has allowed you to scale.", "Jack: Yeah, so a lot of investors ask me \u2026 The first question they ask me, or the last one they ask me is, \u201cWhat\u2019s your valuation?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to raise this amount of money. I don\u2019t know what my valuation is.\u201d You can\u2019t tell me what valuation I make, because at series A, I\u2019m pre-revenue. What is my valuation? I want to raise this amount of money, and obviously I\u2019m not going to diluting for 30%. So, it\u2019s kind of you\u2019re working backwards. It\u2019s like, this is the money, you want to raise 10 mil, I want to diluting 10%, my valuation is 100 million. It\u2019s about who want to pay that 100 million. All you\u2019re kind of thinking is about finding the who, rather than to kind of negotiating valuation. I never negotiate valuation.", "Nathan: Yeah, wow.", "Jack: Yeah.", "Nathan: Okay, interesting. So, I want to switch gears and talk about building a startup here in Australia, even from a talent perspective, you guys have offices around the world now. But talk to me about the early days, you said you were living and breathing this thing, working 20 hour days, sleeping in the office. But still, it\u2019s incredibly hard to find great talent, great developers. Talk to me about that. How have you navigated that?", "Jack: Yeah, so in the early days, it\u2019s mandatory you do a pay cut to join us.", "Nathan: Say that again, sorry?", "Jack: You have to do a pay cut to join us, which not many company managers are able to do in Australia, but we did that. Even now, there\u2019s people doing 50% or 70% pay cut to join us. There\u2019s kind of \u2026 When you talk to other founders in Australia, people are saying it\u2019s ridiculous how you kind of do that. But as a founder, I were able to persuade our employee, we\u2019re building something quite socially impactful and it\u2019s such an important infrastructure in a global scale. There\u2019s no such opportunity in Australia before to building such impactful things and backed by the best investors in the world.", "That just resonates with someone, but obviously someone just completely don\u2019t believe it and think we just talk bullshit. But you know, it\u2019s if people resonate and then people join us and they really engage with the company. We obviously have gone through a lot of churns in people. But I would say the most sort of valuable members of Airwallex have never sort of left. It\u2019s always kind of from the very beginning, we\u2019re incredibly good at retaining the good people. We try to keep them around. And obviously when they join, they do a kind of big pay cut. We try to every six months, we do a review and we give them a small amount, but a meaningful increase to kind of give them the recognition of their contribution to the company.", "And obviously we have to be managing the skill very fast because if you kind of slow down for a year, then people were thinking, \u201cWhat is the up side?\u201d And that sort of stuff. Then that might creating important employee to leaving the company. But you have to get that. Our valuation gets three to five X every year. So, that sort of movement, able to kind of help us to hiring people with a quite conservative salary but a lot of good talent. And I\u2019m still thinking that the people willing to take a massive pay cut to join you are still the most fundamental kind of people that really believe in the vision. I mean, why people want to join you, right? There\u2019s money, there\u2019s upside. There\u2019s people think about upside, but they also truly believe in the vision. I mean, I think a lot of people that did a massive pay cut really believe in the company vision.", "Nathan: You do like ESOP too though, right?", "Jack: Yes.", "Nathan: Yeah, yeah, okay.", "Jack: ESOP is obviously a massive part of our package. It could be a lot more than the cash component we\u2019re offering to people. But we found it\u2019s very difficult to tell people about ESOP in Australia, what exactly it is.", "Nathan: Really? Why?", "Jack: People just don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s not a common thing in Australia. And there\u2019s no such success in Australia before, right? So, apart from . Alasin is probably the only company who have got a successful axis. But what other companies got that sort of 100X, 200X axis in Australia before? There\u2019s not many.", "Nathan: So, talk to me around kind of \u2026 You said that it is difficult to maintain good talent with the speed and scale that you guys are growing and trying to move. What have you learned? When somebody \u2026 For us at our company, we\u2019re hiring, and we\u2019re bootstrapped. We\u2019re trying to hire like one, maybe two people a month. And even that alone, it\u2019s a lot. So, I\u2019m curious, anything you can share that you\u2019ve learned around kind of this blitz scaling? Like, that Reid Hoffman talks about when it comes to blitz scaling. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve read that book, but even hiring people that aren\u2019t even really that great because you just need so many people because you\u2019re trying to move so ridiculously fast and take the market.", "Jack: Yeah, so there\u2019s roles that you could compromise, there\u2019s roles that you couldn\u2019t, right? So, it\u2019s getting that first sort of 10 engineers, getting the fundamental core people at your company is very, very important that you can\u2019t compromise because once you get those core people, those talent will attract in talent, right? So, that\u2019s very, very important. So, if you kind of start compromising on your senior management and they are attracting that kind of multiplier effect, I think that\u2019s very, very bad.", "I think one of the things we did extremely well is to get the very top talent to join us with a massive pay cut and believe in a company vision and upside of the company. And we will prove to them that it\u2019s worth for that sort of short term sacrifice on cash. But it\u2019s a very big opportunity to rapidly scale the company and their career. And not just the financial. I mean, for these sort of top talents, the financial side is the last thing they look at it. And most of them already achieved financial independence.", "I mean, if you look at it, probably half senior management to even consider money as an element when they\u2019re choosing a job. They look at the two important things. The first thing is this something they\u2019re really passionate and they\u2019re actually happy to work there? Obviously the happy kind of considering many things, right? Whether you get valued, you are impacting and you\u2019re doing really interesting stuff and solving a very big problem.", "But the other thing is about the scope of the work that you could be doing, you know? Like, whether you have a very large global scope or you have a very large vertical or market scope to scale your team from one person to 10 person to 20 to 100 in a very short period of time. And to achieve something that sounds like impossible, you know? We\u2019re growing from like 80 people to 320 people within 12 months. That sort of scale is very interesting to some people. And the cash is the last thing. You just need to give them upside. So, when the company succeeded, that you align everyone\u2019s success with the company\u2019s success. So, we keep having very aggressive sort of short term incentive and long term incentives to offer to employees and management. I think that\u2019s the three sort of key things I would say.", "Nathan: How do you make sure the culture scales?", "Jack: That is difficult because if you want to scale the culture, you have to have the people in the top management that understands scale. So, it\u2019s very important at some stage of your company to get in people from other startups who have done it before that kind of mix with your original employees who haven\u2019t don\u2019t it before. That makes this very important for your organisational scaling because those people who have done it, who have scaled from 1 to 10, 10 to 1,000 can bring those experiences to kind of demonstrating how to scale the company. And because you hire very intelligent people, your founding team are very intelligent, you can learn very quickly and mix well with those people then to build a scalable organisation.", "Nathan: I see. And when it comes to some people that haven\u2019t been exposed, especially here, it would be hard to find people that have been exposed to this level of scale, some of these people, they might be in the first, let\u2019s just say batch of 50, but when it gets to 300, 400, or even 200, all these levels of management come in. Some of these people may not be managers. What do you do there? Not everyone might be a great manager, but they\u2019ve been there for a while and\u2026", "Jack: So, that\u2019s the balance between management and speed, right? So, if your company is growing exponentially, right? Then you can using that growth to overcome the management issue because the company is growing so fast, people don\u2019t even have the time to think about those management issues because you\u2019re just telling them, \u201cWe need to grow 10% this month. We need to grow 30% this month.\u201d And all they try to achieve is growing 30%. Any other things is not important. So, you only have one priority, which is growth. There\u2019s no \u2026 You know, don\u2019t think about anything else. All you try to do is this one thing, you have to do it well. That\u2019s it. There\u2019s no other things you wanted to think about.", "But that\u2019s one element. So, you have to make sure you can achieve that growth. And when you\u2019re kind of slowing down, that\u2019s where the risk could happen where you could just blow up, right? I mean, but when you\u2019re kind of growing as a CEO, you really need to be thinking year, two year. I mean, now I\u2019m thinking sort of five year ahead, you know? When my growth\u2019s kind of slowing down, then I know \u2026 because you\u2019re never growing 1000% every year, right? So, you kind of need to know when that going to coming a year, two years ahead. You bring those people right before that curve so that you\u2019re elevating the company\u2019s culture together sort of matching with the company growth.", "That is a tricky thing that as the CEO, you just have to kind of have that instinct of when that will happen, thinking really long term to keep the company accelerating rather than \u2026 I\u2019d never want 100% growth in three to five years\u2019 time. I still want to achieving 300% growth. How to get there is about \u2026 because any product, it takes time to build the product, to launch the product, to grow the product, to scale the product, and one to two years to do that process.", "If you\u2019re kind of thinking about next year, you\u2019re already too late. You really need to think about three years to five years ahead, where\u2019s that extra 100 million revenue going to come from? And then you\u2019ve got to do it this year. So, right now, as a company, we\u2019re investing 80% of our time and money on the three to five year growth, not the growth this year and next year.", "Nathan: Yeah, wow. Interesting. Look, we have to work towards wrapping up. I\u2019m curious more around your personal growth as a founder. This is the first time you\u2019ve done and scaled a company this size. Who are you learning from? Obviously you\u2019re learning from experience. Do you have a lot of mentors? Do you read books? Where are you learning this stuff? Because-", "Jack: I think because we\u2019re fortunate to invested by a lot of top venture capital that there\u2019s a lot of communication and conferences for founders to catch up within the Tencent or Sequoia or DFC\u2019s portfolio that kind of learn from that. And also one of the key things I\u2019ve learned things from interview. I spend a lot of time interviewing people to learn from people, whether they\u2019re good or bad, there\u2019s things I can learn. That\u2019s very important.", "Also, self-reflection. Just be really, really honest about your weaknesses and strengths and try to hire people that can complement with your skillset is very, very important. And be extremely honest and transparent to everyone that you work with. And not just telling people the good things, but telling people the bad things. And also, admit your failure and your weakness I think is very, very important.", "Nathan: Awesome. Well, look, last question or two more questions. The first one is, best piece of advice or something you\u2019d like to share with our audience? Or any parting words of wisdom? And lastly, where\u2019s the best place people can go and find out more about Airwallex?", "Jack: The first one, I would say to founders, at the single point in time, there\u2019s only one priority in your company, which is get shit done and grow. Don\u2019t think about anything else. Think about anything else when you kind of have the scale. So, just doing everything you can. Have that obsessive intensity in every day of your job. I mean, not everyone can do it, you\u2019ve got to sacrifice a lot of things. But you\u2019ve got to ask your question, are you willing to sacrifice your house, your time with family and everything to do that? And if the answer is yes, then maybe you are born to be entrepreneur and doing a very fast growing startup. And the last one is around \u2026 Sorry, the last question is-", "Nathan: Yeah, where can people find out more about Airwallex?", "Jack: Yeah, so Airwallex, I\u2019m on Twitter, I\u2019m on WeChat. Also on LinkedIn, people can kind of contact me through LinkedIn or Twitter. More about our company, our website is the best place. And we have a career page and we have a lot of interesting product that you can know more about Airwallex. And the rest is just Google the company story.

That, and his time working at a car dealership.", "\u201cThe first real job I had was my sixth job,\u201d he says of the gig. \u201cI was fired from my first five. Fired from my sixth job. I was fired six times, but I wouldn\u2019t leave the last job. I just would not leave.\u201d", "Part of the reason Cardone\u2019s bosses kept getting so fed up with him was that he was a terrible driver. Not a great quality when working in the car business, as he kept smashing up the merchandise. But his relentlessness made up for it.", "\u201cI would wreck their cars and they would fire me,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then before I would leave, I would go sell something and they would keep me on. Selling something was always forgiveness.\u201d", "By the time Cardone finally did leave, he was the highest-grossing salesman at the dealership. He was the first one there in the morning and the last one to leave at night, his goal always being to make himself indispensable to the company. And to make a lot of money.", "So yeah, Cardone is, well, obsessive. Coming up from nothing, financially speaking, he quickly learned that was the way to rise to the top. It\u2019s helped him achieve his lifelong goals to make money, have a successful career, and help people along the way. Now, Cardone\u2019s exploring that approach to life and business with his new book, appropriately titled Be Obsessed or Be Average.", "In his book, Cardone writes, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a father who could lead me to the land of the rich, lend me a million dollars for my first real estate deal, assist with political connections through introductions at country clubs, or show me the ways of business.\u201d", "His fate was forged, instead, by the tragic death of his father when Cardone was just 10 years old. Until that day, he had watched his father work hard to provide for his wife and his five children, starting a variety of businesses, from opening a grocery store to starting a life insurance company, and finally becoming a licensed stock broker.", "His father\u2019s \u201cdrive and his obsession,\u201d as Cardone puts it, were inspiring. And when he died, leaving the family behind to get by on their own, Cardone became obsessed himself\u2014with the idea of creating enough wealth so he would never worry about money again.", "But his was a winding path to success.

Sure, he\u2019d started a business and it was running smoothly, but he wasn\u2019t reinvesting in it. He wasn\u2019t thinking about marketing or expanding.

Which one?", "Nathan: How do you find yourself, you know, doing what you\u2019re doing today?", "Grant: I mean, I don\u2019t know which one it is. I run 17 little companies and/or partner or collaborate with people in businesses. Also, run a household. Father to two kids and their friends and all that insanity and try to be a husband. So I got a lot of different posts, and most of you out there can relate to this, as well as for the last 30 I guess 35, 36 years trying to figure it out who I am, what I am, what I\u2019m supposed to do. That\u2019s been the main job. Who am I? Who am I as a individual, a dream maker. Like I never wanted to be an entrepreneur. What I wanted to do was make my dreams come true, and I think that that\u2019s gotten me through the cycles of trying to figure out how to become a sales guy if I needed to or a sales manager or how do I hire people, you know, how to organise the business? When do I spend money?", "Like there\u2019s so many jobs, I don\u2019t even know which story \u2026 I just finished talking to 4,000 or 5,000 people, and my job in that was different than my job with you today. Right? My job now is to keep your audience of one, one person\u2019s watching this at a time. That viewer, you\u2019re listening or you\u2019re watching, you only care about your information. So I\u2019ve got to figure out how to communicate to him, communicate to you. Appease the sound dude. Impossible. Okay?", "And so, you know, and then we fly to Oakland and I\u2019ll do a gig tomorrow. In the meantime, I got to spin plates, whether it\u2019s the kids and the wife and the relationship or it\u2019s my own dreams. What about my dreams? Because, I see a lot of people get lost in what they want to do because of the job. And I know I did. From probably 25 til 45 I was in one job, I was a sales guy. I was trying to peddle something, sell something, get some money so that I could fund my lifestyle. And when I broke out of that and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019ve got more than one post.\u201d That really helped me a lot. So I don\u2019t know how exactly how to answer that first question that you ask everybody.", "Nathan: Well, how\u2019d you get started? Like what was your first company? What did it look like? How did it all happen?", "Grant: My first company was working for somebody else. It wasn\u2019t until I figured out how to make somebody else rich that I could be rich. I hear a lot of guys saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to work for somebody else. I don\u2019t want to keep making other people \u2026\u201d When I became successful in another company then left that company and went and worked for another company and made them super successful to the point to where these companies were literally dependent upon me, that\u2019s the thing. That\u2019s the muscle and the grit, persistence and fortitude are like you know what? My ego wasn\u2019t like, \u201cI need my name on it,\u201d but my ego was strong enough to say, \u201cI want to be the best in the company. I want to make this company dependent upon me.\u201d", "The first real job I had was my sixth job. I was fired from my first five. Fired from my six job, six times but just wouldn\u2019t leave the last one, I just would not leave. So literally like I\u2019d wreck stuff. I have a terrible driving record. I was in the car business, and I\u2019d wreck their cars and they\u2019d fire me and I said, \u201cOkay, okay, okay.\u201d And I had a bunch of other problems as well. Then before I would leave, I would go sell something, then they would keep me on. Selling something was always forgiveness. So when I finally left that company, they went under. Like they couldn\u2019t \u2026 my production was so high that one person leaving the car company failed.", "Went to my next job, which was speaking, consulting, using my sales philosophies and gifts, if you will. We would go around companies and teach them. And I worked for him for 20 months. I was like the top guy in his company. Now the reason I\u2019m saying that is that was the job for me. And that was a business. I treated that little, my little department like this is my company within a company. And I wanted to make that company as strong as possible so that when I finally went out on my own, which I was forced to go out on my own, I didn\u2019t want to go out on my own. I went out on my own just because there was just no opportunity left. There was no way for me to score where I was, which I still remember today. It\u2019s important to get good people, to keep them that like you got to give them some other pond to swim in. So when I started my first company I guess I was 29. That was a company where I was cold calling on businesses around the US and Canada.", "Nathan: And like fast forward to today collectively, or is it 17 companies turn over $150 million?", "Grant: Yeah, we\u2019ll do a $156 million. We\u2019re on track for $156 million this year. Plus the real estate, real estate\u2019s another endeavour. Yeah. You know at anytime that real estate can just pew big, huge, like $200, $300 million scores, but the real estate $1.2 billion. Today I started with the $78,000 a house, $3,000 to start that business with $3,000. And signed a 30 year mortgage on a house I would keep like 10 months, and now that\u2019s $1.2 billion. That\u2019ll end up being a $10 billion business. But I wouldn\u2019t think in any of this stuff when I was 29.", "Nathan: What were you thinking?", "Grant: Dude, I was thinking about it like how do I get enough money to pay the bills? The first three years I was in business, I made $30,000 a year.", "Nathan: Three years, first three years?", "Grant: Yeah, the last year I left somebody I was making a $150,000, $160,000 a year. The first maybe 27 months that I was in business, I made less than $30,000 a year. I went backwards. But the problem was I was not \u2026 I do what a lot of entrepreneurs do. The mistake a lot entrepreneurs make is, number one, they never look up the definition entrepreneur. And entrepreneur means someone is who organises a business or businesses and invests money, takes greater than normal risk with money in order to expand or organise those businesses. I wasn\u2019t spending the money on my business. All I was doing was knocking on doors. It was just pure effort. I wasn\u2019t spending money. I wouldn\u2019t spend real money until I was 50 years old, about 10 years ago when a guy said, \u201cBro, you\u2019re not a business.\u201d And I said, what? And I can feel this.", "Yeah. I was a hustler. I was a grinder, but I wasn\u2019t a business, and I could feel it, you know? Yeah. I was a consultant. I was making some money like in my 30s and 40s I made, you know, I made a lot of money. What other people would call a lot of money. Yeah. But I was not a business. You know what I mean?", "Nathan: What do you mean by that?", "Grant: Well, I was just hustling.", "Nathan: Transactional, selling widgets. Yeah.", "Grant: Everything was a transaction. Everything was a transaction to get money, pay the taxes, have a little bit of money left over. Everything was in a transaction. Yeah.

I was no different than when I was 30 just pounding doors, which was good.", "And I think a lot of people need to \u2026 you don\u2019t need to skip that spot either. Because once I put the two together, okay, I can pound the door, I can learn e-commerce, I can be a one product sale. I could sell to companies. Like today, we\u2019ll sell a product to a company for $80,000 on a three to five year contract, $80,000 a year. And I\u2019ll switch immediately and sell an $8 product online, or I\u2019ll give something away for free to speaking to 4,000 people today in hopes that I can meet maybe 40 of them that I can do have a partnership and a collaboration with in the future.", "Nathan: You said 10 years ago someone said to you, you don\u2019t have a business. What changed? How have you built what you\u2019ve built now? Is that when the whole 10X got started?", "Grant: Yeah, exactly. 10X woke me up. 10X was not for the public, 10X was for me. I was trying to figure out why am I \u2026 I work hard. I got great products, got a great reputation, great reviews. People like me, they like my content, they like my content actually better than they like me. And that might\u2019ve been an exaggeration. You know what I mean?

So when the economy crashed, which was I guess almost 10 years ago in America particularly, it was so devastating that if you had any weakness in a business, like every weakness was showed. You know, Warren buffet talks about, \u201cHey, what are you wearing when the tide goes out?\u201d Well, dude, in 2008, 2009, and 2010 when the tide went out, every weakness that I had exhibited \u2026 hard work did not leave you less vulnerable in 2010. You could work hard and still you\u2019d be upside down in your house. You could lose everything. Your cash accounts or garbage, stocks got wrecked. Everything, right?", "So 2010 was really the whisper. You\u2019re not a business son. That was the big, you\u2019re not a business. That\u2019s when I made a decision, okay, I\u2019m going to build a business. First thing I did was flipped everything. I\u2019m not a sale. I realised I was at sales for \u2026 I can no longer be sales first, I had to be marketing first, marketing and branding. So the 10X thing was really like, hey, you got to get your \u2026 people knew me in a particular industry. They didn\u2019t know me in every industry.

And there\u2019s people around me that needed to eat. So I had to keep knocking on doors, spin that plate, not get stuck in it too much, then figured out how do I market and brand, how do I build a name? Nobody knew me. 10 years ago, you did not know my name. People watching didn\u2019t know my name. Like people that are coming on the scene now, they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, my God, that guy, he\u2019s got 12, 14 million people following and blah, blah blah.\u201d", "But you know, I started with one follower just like everybody else, and I was the follower, my second follower\u2019s my wife, because I created an account for him on YouTube and said you\u2019re going to follow me.

How do I get them to want me to come here? How do I get people in London to want to know me? Canada, South America. Oh, I got to be in Spanish if I\u2019m going to South America.

I\u2019ll take it all.", "Okay, so you know, you can\u2019t keep, you got to keep growing. Like Facebook is growing, they\u2019re growing all the possibilities of things they can do with people. So if you want to be a great business, you can\u2019t get to a place where you\u2019re satisfied. And I had done that. I had gotten satisfied in my business externally, financially, but internally I wasn\u2019t.

I wasn\u2019t studying Gary V and Tony and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat are the companies doing?\u201d When I realised, I think I was in Bogota, I was in Bogota speaking to a church, and I went to the grocery store and Coca-Cola was there.

Like you driving up in a Lambo means nothing to me. It could work in reverse on me. It\u2019d be like, okay, no reason to have that car.", "Nathan: So why did you buy the jet?", "Grant: Oh, that\u2019s a good question. That\u2019s a hundred Lambos. Okay. Why do I buy the jet? Because that fucking Jet could get me to Sydney can get me to Melbourne. It can get me to Auckland tonight. Right? It can give me the Fiji. It can get me back to the United States, 14 hours. I can be in Miami and get a phone call about a real piece of real estate and say I\u2019ll be there in three hours. No man, you can\u2019t be here in three hours. No, dude, I\u2019m going to be there in three hours. Boom. Get on that jet. Fire that bitch up. Let\u2019s roll. Boom. I\u2019m there looking at the property three hours later. So you can\u2019t do that in a Lambo. They hold on, let me get in my Lambo. I\u2019ll be over there. Big deal. Right? Anybody?", "Any fake can do that, and it\u2019s an indication that you\u2019re playing at a level nobody cares about. Warren\u2019s not driving a Lambo. Bill\u2019s not driving a Lambo. He could. Right? But how do they both transport themselves to Davos? In a private jet. So you see the difference? Like I am extremely frugal when comes to spending. I don\u2019t have fancy shoes on. I mean, I don\u2019t mind. I can do all that stuff but don\u2019t do it out of order. Like you\u2019re not going to fake anybody cause you\u2019re wearing Gucci, you know, or you got a Hermes belt, whatever it is, right? You know, you can\u2019t fake a jet. You can keep it, you can buy a jet and keep one in the air and keep pilots and hangers and shit? There ain\u2019t no faking that shit like that. That\u2019s not something you can fake.", "You take a picture in front of one. You could charter one once, but you can\u2019t fake buying one, putting your name on the back of it. It just takes you to a whole nother level. Who taught me that? Like who taught me, \u201cHey, go buy a jet.\u201d Your uncle\u2019s not going to teach you that. Your daddy\u2019s not going to teach you that, because they don\u2019t think like that. Your accountant\u2019s going to tell you not to do it. But if you study the most successful people on this planet, regardless of what they tell you, how are they getting around? So that\u2019s the problem we\u2019re in today. We\u2019re in an environment right now where entrepreneurs listen to everything that everybody has to say. I mean this, it\u2019s great that we have these, right, but there\u2019s a negative to having so much content and data.", "The positive about the internet is the availability information, and the negative is the availability. I can go in there and tell anybody I\u2019m great. I\u2019m the best in the world. And it\u2019s almost like nobody can take that down. I am the greatest in the world, and that\u2019s fine if I am the greatest. But if I\u2019m not the greatest, if I\u2019m just a scammer, then that becomes a problem.", "Nathan: Coming back to your team, like you\u2019ve got this incredible team. What do you look for? How do you find these incredible people? How do you keep them motivated?", "Grant: Yeah, well I don\u2019t find them and they find me. So what we do is we just, we get the beacon. How does Facebook attract talent? You know, they don\u2019t need to go find them. It\u2019s like meat to a shark, you know? It\u2019s like I\u2019m coming. I smell the blood in the water. So they\u2019re going to Facebook, right? How do you attract great talent? This is what people ask me every day. How do you attract great people? They get so freaking beaming hot white light that people are like, \u201cI want to work on that project.\u201d", "I went and saw a Hobbs and Shaw last night. It did $333 million. It\u2019s got Rock and Statham in it. $333 million opening weekend worldwide. Third of $1 billion. Dude. Like ridiculous. Great movie, by the way. Had a blast watching it, but you know, how does that much money go to one place? How did that many great people work on that movie? You know, because who\u2019s involved in it? Right? So, greatness attracts greatness. So these people, the call, \u201cHey, I want to work for you.\u201d I had a kid come say, \u201cHey, come on, I want to work for you.\u201d", "It\u2019s a good deal. I don\u2019t hire but I don\u2019t hire people. I\u2019m not the hire guy. I\u2019m the guy that\u2019s creating new opportunities though that people want to stay. They want to stay in the theme park and become their own show. So if you notice, I show off my people a lot. I don\u2019t like keep them behind the scenes. I\u2019m like, here, you know, let\u2019s have more than the Grant show. Let\u2019s have the Grant/Frank Kern show, the Brandon Dalston show, the Jared show, the Ryan Sacco show, the real estate show. Let\u2019s show the G&E show, Elena and myself. Let\u2019s bring other people and partners in. Why? Why do I do that? Where am I learning at? Great companies, great companies grow their brands and scale out and do a lot of different things.", "Nathan: What if you had in your early days \u2013", "Grant: Just make money, make money, make money, make money, make money, your battle cry. Go collect money. Don\u2019t make money. You just go collect money, have a great product, have a great service, over deliver, collect money, charge for it. This is what me and Gary would \u2026 me and Gary would have a cage match. I\u2019d just beat the fuck out of him. But Gary, anytime, anywhere, okay? But most people out there watching this, you need to monetize. You know, this is insanity that you\u2019re being told, don\u2019t monetize your business. If you have a good business, have a good service, have a good product, sell it.", "But so many guys, they\u2019re trying these little kid gimmicks. You know, it\u2019s fine if my kids flip shoes on eBay. If you\u2019re an adult, man, you\u2019ve got to get beyond flipping sneakers on eBay, you need to build a business. Otherwise, don\u2019t call yourself an entrepreneur because that\u2019s not what an entrepreneur. An entrepreneur is not flipping shit on eBay. That\u2019s not a business. That\u2019s you trying to make $2 on a toy that you bought at a garage sale. It\u2019s a different gig.", "Now, if you could figure out how to scale that, but it sounds to me like you\u2019re benefiting eBay more than you\u2019re benefiting yourself. eBay is the pimp and you\u2019re basically the prostitute in that machinery, which is no problem with that, right? But you\u2019re servicing the machine rather than building your own machine. I want to build a machine. I want to build a machine that lives longer than I do, so that if I get a good partnership with somebody and we cut a deal and they\u2019re 90% of the profits in future and I\u2019m 10% in, my kids are my charity, get to keep that 10% after I\u2019m dead, man. I\u2019m good to go.", "Nathan: So what\u2019s next? Like, you got the jet. What\u2019s next, man?", "Grant: Man, I don\u2019t know.", "Nathan: What\u2019s 10X for you now?", "Grant: 10X is how do I do $1 billion a year in income? And then how do I do $10 billion in real estate? How do I have a $10 billion real estate portfolio? Last month we paid $1.4 million out to investors in the real estate. How do I start compete with these banks? So they\u2019re like, \u201cYou know what? We really don\u2019t like all this noise you\u2019re making, and you\u2019re a noisy fucking guy, and we\u2019re kind of getting tired of now.\u201d When you get noisy enough, they either buy you and suppress you. You know?", "That\u2019s what Bill Gates would do with Apple years ago, the tablet, the original iPhone was a little call \u2026 Anyway, it had a little pen, you wrote on it. They\u2019d buried that project for years. Yeah, I\u2019ll think of it in a second. I think of it when the interview\u2019s over. Maybe you guys know what it is. Okay. Anyway, it\u2019s probably 20 years ago. Actually had a company built around this thing, and Bill Gates came in, gave Apple Steve Jobs a loan and said, look, \u201cI\u2019ll lend you this money. You got to bury that product,\u201d and they did. So that\u2019s what you can do. Or they consume you. They buy you and say, \u201cHey, we want you to be part of our,\u201d so maybe that\u2019s what happens. I don\u2019t know.", "Nathan: Talk to me about real estate. Like right now, what do you think his state of real estate and the financial markets are like?", "Grant: The entire world should be invested in the United States of America. There\u2019s a certain type of a real estate in America that\u2019s produce no other place on the planet, and until they start building it here in Australia or in London, like you should be buying real estate that provides housing, a place for people to live called apartments. In America they\u2019re called apartments or multifamily, residential, commercial real estate. It\u2019s actually a residential, place where residents live, but it\u2019s a commercial style of real estate. 300 to 500 units in one location. So we\u2019d closed the deal last week, 507 units. One close, one location.", "A guy here told me, he\u2019s like, \u201cI did 500 homes last year.\u201d I said, \u201cI did 500 last week.\u201d I\u2019m just saying, okay so in one location. He had to do 500 closings. I did one closing 500 units, and those people pay rent there. So 500 times $1,500 a month to $2200 bucks a month. Great property, beautiful location, great amenities that is cashflow positive, pay all the maintenance, pay the taxes, property taxes, the roof, the paint, the turnover, the marketing and still leave cash open for the investors, and pay down the debt for like \u2026 It is the ultimate multiplier for the everyday person. The everyday person\u2019s not going to found Facebook or Netflix. Me, most people are not going to get there. So this is the perfect investment vehicle for everyday people.", "Nathan: If you\u2019re like in your early days where you just reinvesting, you\u2019re sacrificing profit for growth, at what point should you look to start to diversify and start to build your personal wealth into property?", "Grant: Yeah, so that\u2019s a great question. One, people should be invested in the beginning just in themselves. Every chance you get to go to something that we could possibly help you has, if it has a 1% chance of even adding to the value you have in here? Spend the money, don\u2019t sit on money, money\u2019s useless. So if you have $5,000 left in your account, I would spend the whole $5,000 on yourself. When you spend money on yourself, you\u2019re going to start getting better at whatever you\u2019re doing. If you just keep doing it, if you keep spending it. Just because you spent it once and it didn\u2019t work, go do it again. And then again. And then again. That has been one thing in my life. Like if you asked me, \u201cHey, what\u2019s one thing,\u201d I always invest in me first. Not the business.", "Nathan: Not the business?", "Grant: Not the real estate. Me, my condition. How am I doing? Am I around the right people? Am I listening? Like I don\u2019t care what it is. Dinner, lunch, charities. I\u2019ll just go to anything. Anything where I think there\u2019s other people doing well, like I just want to hear somebody say something that just inspires me.", "Nathan: So how much do you reckon you invest in yourself every year right now?", "Grant: Oh, last year I probably spent, you know, couple hundred grand. I spent more than that and I would, I\u2019d still spend more than that. So look, it starts with me, how good a condition I \u2026 I know people out there spend more money on their car than they do themselves. They pay $300, $400, $500 a month on their car and think nothing of it. Won\u2019t spend $500 on themselves. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s completely backwards. You paying the man, you\u2019re paying for food, you\u2019re paying for groceries, you\u2019re paying for movies, you\u2019re paying for bullshit, you\u2019re paying, you went and bought a house.", "That was the dumbest thing anybody could do. That\u2019s the dumbest thing I ever did was buy a house. I bought a house and I didn\u2019t improve myself. I was improving the house. I spent more time picking furniture out then I did, \u201cHey, how do I fix me? How do I get faster, more confident?\u201d Because I bring my confidence or lack of confidence to every table. Okay, so first thing, invest in yourself. Then the business, as a result of that, the business, wherever you are in the business cycle, shit\u2019s will start getting better. When it does, it\u2019ll kick out more money. When there\u2019s so much money that you can\u2019t reinvest that money either in yourself or the business, at that point you\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, I want to buy the third float, the next flow of income.\u201d I would buy cashflow. So I don\u2019t know what that number is, you know?", "Nathan: Yeah. Because like speaking from personal experience, we\u2019ve got a great vehicle, which is the business and it\u2019s like at what? Like I could just keep putting it in, putting it in, putting in, but at what time do I look to, you know \u2013", "Grant: How much money is raised? How much money is it?", "Nathan: I don\u2019t talk about our revenue publicly, but-", "Grant: Well, how much money you talking about sitting around, how much money just sitting around?", " Nathan: I really shouldn\u2019t share-", "Grant: But dude, why? Why not? Why? Well, I\u2019ll share it. I\u2019ve got $167 million in cash sitting in my fucking accounts right now. Look at it every day. Every day I look at it. If you don\u2019t talk about money, you can\u2019t. You should talk about money. All sell bullshit, people said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about money.\u201d The IRS, who\u2019s IRS in this country?", "Nathan: ATO.", "Grant: They know. ATO knows. Fuck. If you\u2019re telling ATO you hate their guts, why wouldn\u2019t you tell me. Fucking tell me how much is it? What\u2019s the number, man? You\u2019re a bitch if you don\u2019t tell me. You can\u2019t cut this out, by the way. How much is it?", "Now you got me interested. Because this is going to be really important for your audience. Okay? You got to get that money going.", "Nathan: Let\u2019s just put it this way. In the business we\u2019ve got great cash flow reserves. And do we take it out", "Grant: How much of those-", "Nathan: For risk.", "Grant: For what risk?", "Nathan: Never know.", "Grant: How long have you been in business?", "Nathan: Six years.", "Grant: Six years, dude. In six years, you know, just look back over the last six years. Because I did the same thing. I had all this money sitting there for the thing that was going to happen. Okay. If you believe in the law of attraction, you\u2019re planning for the thing and it will happen. Like you\u2019re planning for it. It\u2019s going to happen, right?", "Nathan: We\u2019re pushing hard on growth to \u2013", "Grant: But at some point you know you can only spend so much. You\u2019re like, \u201cOkay I can\u2019t spend any more here.\u201d", "Nathan: Oh, we could spend more.", "Grant: You could.", "Nathan: Yeah.", "Grant: Then there\u2019s your answer. Spend it dude. Don\u2019t sit on it. You\u2019ve no reason to have a reserve. Why don\u2019t we spend those reserves? Because your little bit of doubt, a little bit of doubt it\u2019s going to pay off so you start believing in the money more than the \u2026 right? You start believing in the money more than the possibility.", "Nathan: A hate risk, man.", "Grant: Huh?", "Nathan: I hate risk.", "Grant: I hate risk too. That\u2019s why I buy the kind of real estate I buy. Every day the first sheet of paper I get every day is how much cash I have. The reason I\u2019m looking at that is not bragging rights. It\u2019s because I want to get rid of it. It\u2019s like trash. I want to get rid of this money. I want to get that money to buy something that has babies. Right? So I\u2019m everyday I\u2019m looking, I\u2019ve got to get rid of this cash. I have this much cash. I want to push it. Money\u2019s being devalued worldwide right now.", "Nathan: So answer me this, right now you said you have almost 500 employees. In all of those businesses you have no cashflow reserves.", "Grant: No, no, I didn\u2019t say that. I didn\u2019t say I had none. Okay. But I don\u2019t need $167 million.", "Nathan: Like six months worth? Six months \u2013 break even? Yeah?", "Grant: Six months would be awesome, dude. Six months would be massive amounts, but do I really need six months if the other businesses are kicking cash off? Right? See, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do. I\u2019m trying to take a bunch of these businesses and find one that I know for sure if the world gets cut in half again, which it will and it\u2019ll be a hard, brutal, terrible, it\u2019s going to be awful. Probably robots are going to accelerate that. And then I want this other business that will benefit from this downturn that we\u2019ll continue to spit if I\u2019m alive or not alive, or if the economy gets crashed. I\u2019m looking for that place that can allow me to walk away if I choose to from these other things that maybe don\u2019t work as well.", "All businesses have a life cycle, used to be 80 years, now it\u2019s like eight. So you know, the great companies used to be around for \u2026 they\u2019d dominate. Ford motor company, it\u2019s probably not going to make it. I mean, I hate to say that, but I mean it could happen.", "Nathan: It is that cycle?", "Grant: Yeah, exactly. So particularly these companies that are being created today, they\u2019re going to, you know, most of these companies are going to last eight months, year and a half, everything\u2019s going to get morphed. Who would\u2019ve thought taxicabs would be nonexistent one day?", "Nathan: Yeah. Crazy. So look, we have to work towards wrapping up. Mindful of your time, man. So a couple more questions. I\u2019m really curious around this 10X philosophy, and let\u2019s just say, you\u2019re trying to go 10X, right? You\u2019re 10X, your goals. How do you know that that\u2019s just not unachievable?", "Grant: It\u2019s not achievable, but it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s not achievable. You got sitting in an account today. What if you had $50 million? You\u2019re like, \u201cOh, well, it\u2019s not achievable.\u201d Okay. But it\u2019s worth fucking going for it. It\u2019s fun shit, man. Tell me you wouldn\u2019t be happy with $50 million sitting in a bank account figuring out what to do with it, right or wrong. You\u2019d be like, dude, I can make a move now. I can make a move.", "Nathan: I\u2019d buy the jet, man.", "Grant: No, no. You wouldn\u2019t buy a jet. If all you had was $50 million you wouldn\u2019t buy a jet. So like you guys out there that, Oh, who needs 50 million? Nobody needs it, man. But somebody is going to end up with it. People actually end up with this much money. And the problem right now in the world is nobody\u2019s thinking about, why can\u2019t I get 50? Or, why can\u2019t you scale your businesses to where there in New York, they\u2019re in London, they\u2019re in wherever you want it to be. Where your companies could hire tens of thousands of people. Why not Nathan? Why not Grant? Why not you guys? And you could change the world. So all these people that tell me money ain\u2019t going to make you happy and all that shit.

Merrill says they discovered that the lead developer had plans to steal the company and had been secretly pitching his own version of the game to other publishers.", "The cultural divide Merrill saw growing within the young company, punctuated by this betrayal, inspired the co-founders to become far more hands on with their business.", "\u201cThat was a really galvanizing event that helped teach Brandon and I that when experienced individuals say, \u2018Trust me, because my 20 years experience in this particular industry or this field means that I know what I\u2019m talking about,\u2019 it\u2019s really important to say, \u2018Well, enlighten us,\u2019\u201d Merrill says. \u201cIf somebody can\u2019t articulate a good rationale for whatever it is they\u2019re doing, even if it\u2019s a deeply technical concept, that\u2019s a red flag.\u201d", "Merrill and Beck righted the ship, took a more active role, and set out toward building a game demo that would illustrate their idea to investors and publishers. But after constructing the demo, they realized they didn\u2019t have the internal talent yet to fully realize the game they envisioned.", "So they established an advisory board, through which very experienced, talented developers could gain free shares in the company by mentoring Riot Games\u2019 young developers, without leaving their full-time jobs.", "Over time, the relationships with those on the advisory board grew. While initially, those developers would have said no when invited to join the the team, things began to change. \u201cAs that equation changed, those eventually turned into yeses,\u201d Merrill says.", "With each new, experienced addition to the team, the game development leaped forward with new input and inspiration for the junior talent, pushing the limits of what was possible for the company.", "While the game slowly took shape, they started approaching publishers with the idea. Unfortunately, Merrill says, every publisher they spoke with believed the concept of a free battle arena game that generates revenue through in-game purchases was insane.", "\u201cOur whole business model was very unproven at the time,\u201d Merrill says, \u201cbecause our game was planning to be free, and we were literally selling virtual goods.\u201d", "Because of this, they realized they were going to have to publish the game on their own. And that was going to require some serious cash\u2014$20 million, in fact.", "\u201cWe had no idea if we were going to be successful until spending about $17 million of other people\u2019s money and bringing the product to market and then starting to get validation,\u201d he says.", "This made investors nervous, and Merrill says that 50 VCs turned them down before Benchmark and FirstMark Capital decided to come on board at $7 million. Riot Games was given the first half of the investment up front, with the second half to come after they had conducted a 1,000-user beta test.", "The only problem was that in 2008\u2014before widespread smartphone adoption or cloud computing\u2014the technology was not yet in a place to support the user base they anticipated for their game, meaning they had to build that, too.", "After briefly partnering with a startup in an attempt to outsource the creation of the necessary backend, they were $1 million poorer and no closer to what they needed. So, in the second half of 2008, they worked to build the platform internally from scratch.", "With only three months of funding left in their account, Merrill says they hired 1,100 people in the Philippines to beta test the game in internet cafes. The test was successful, and Riot Games lived on.", "But Riot Games\u2019 potentially catastrophic struggles were not in the rearview just yet. With launch day rapidly approaching, Merrill, Beck, and the 55-person team prepared to self-publish in North America and to publish in Europe through a licensing deal with GOA, a division of Orange Telecom. They even had a set \u201cship date\u201d despite the downloadable nature of the game, to try to build credibility with media outlets skeptical of the level of quality found in most free games.", "Everything was ready to go. At least it seemed like it was.", "Rather than building the store feature of the game themselves, Merrill says they had hired an online store provider to handle the construction and management of the in-game shop. But as the beta tests progressed, the store struggled to keep up with growing demand. They tried removing unneeded features, but it made little difference.", "The store was the hinge on which the door swung. It was the only way for the free game to generate revenue, and it housed the players\u2019 in-game wallets and account systems, meaning that without the store, players wouldn\u2019t have any content.", "Because of this, Merrill was eventually forced to conclude that, once again, it would be better for them to build something of their own from scratch that could meet their needs. He reached this decision two weeks before Oct. 27, 2009, the set launch date for League of Legends.", "It was time to get creative.", "To buy themselves the time necessary to build the store, the game started with a \u201claunch party,\u201d during which all players could access all of the game\u2019s content for free. The strategy worked well, attracting tens of thousands of players to the game, and once the shop was introduced, the paid content began immediately generating revenue.", "But Merrill says that the main reason League of Legends succeeded wasn\u2019t their ability to attract new customers. It was their ability to retain them. So when the game continued to grow steadily in North America but remained stagnant in the European market, they had to take a closer look at what was happening underneath the hood.", "In North America, Riot Games made players feel heard, addressing their concerns with regular two-week patches. The European publishing partner, however, was unable to meet this same level of service, and Merrill says this is what caused the stagnation.", "So they immediately set to work unwinding the deal they had made with GOA, and then had 45 days to create a European entity, build an office, hire staff, create servers, and get the whole operation rolling so that gameplay in Europe would go uninterrupted.", "Despite the hassle, the change made all the difference.", "\u201cWe were able to operate differently and demonstrate why quality service matters because the second we took it over, we started growing,\u201d he says. \u201cThen, Europe started growing faster than North America.\u201d", "Slowly but surely, month over month, League of Legends gained an avid fan base until it became the worldwide sensation it is today.", "But there was one more dream Merrill and Beck wanted to try to bring to life.", "Both Merrill and Beck grew up loving and playing sports in the same way they loved and played video games.", "\u201cWe always believed that competitive online games of a certain type had all of the same dynamics that \u2018real sports\u2019 did,\u201d he says.", "They knew that someday, a game would become an arena sport just like basketball or football. So why not theirs?", "In July 2010, they introduced the first significant update to League of Legends called Season One. With this update came the concept of singles and team rankings. This enabled them to launch a tournament system that would end in a final tournament in Sweden for a $100,000 cash prize.", "Interest in the tournament exploded as gamers battled for the crown. But Merrill says the realization that this could actually become something big came not from the competitors, but from the fans.", "During their first end-of-season tournament, over a million viewers tuned in to watch.", "\u201cFor us, that was validation of, like, \u2018Wow, a lot of people are like us and really do want to watch games played at a competitive level.\u2019\u201d", "From that moment, the esports aspect of Riot Games grew rapidly. They established leagues worldwide and a world cup system similar to soccer.", "Today, they operate 13 leagues across the globe and hold their World Championship in the Staples Center, home of the LA Lakers. Merrill says there is even a player in China sponsored by Nike and that their most recent World Cup had more than 99.6 million live viewers, besting the viewership ratings for the Super Bowl.", "\u201cAs a League player, there\u2019s always something to watch,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s always something to talk about. There\u2019s interesting drama between teams. There\u2019s players and pros to aspire to or to become fans of. There\u2019s events that are happening all around the world.\u201d", "Podcasts have sprung up analyzing players and teams, and fans cheer on players from their country the way they would with any other sport.", "Merrill says that about half of League players will never spend a cent in game, but that\u2019s OK with him.", "\u201cOur business is fundamentally about keeping players entertained and engaged over the long term,\u201d he says, \u201cand our view is that the only way to really do that is by delivering incredible value to them.\u201d", "And if they don\u2019t buy in-game items, they might buy one of the ancillary products, like the comic line currently running through Marvel. Or they may simply tune in for big events to cheer on their favorite players.", "While they work to further establish esports leagues, Riot Games is also striving to improve every aspect of the game itself. Merrill says that, since launch, they\u2019ve redone every aspect of the game multiple times, improved their tools pipeline, overhauled their engine, and expanded their team to 3,000 globally.", "They are also looking into the creation of new games.", "\u201cRiot is Riot Game right now, we\u2019re not Riot Games,\u201d he says. \u201cThe \u2018s\u2019 is still aspirational.\u201d", "But Merrill knows that there is so much more to come for the video game company he and his college roommate founded to solve the woes of gamers like them.", "\u201cWe really feel like we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d", "When founders set to work on their first companies, they are faced with a whirlwind of concerns, needs, and potential goals. But Marc Merrill believes these four items should be at the top of every early-stage founder\u2019s to-do list:", "Set a Clear Mission", "\u201cHaving a deep sense of purpose and mission can really carry you through the darkest days, and also carry you and your team to great heights.\u201d", "Build the Ideal Team", "\u201cIn our view\u2014and I think in many businesses\u2014the team is by far and away the most valuable asset. So getting the right people, building the right culture, being thoughtful about mission and purpose\u2026those are all really important things to evaluate when building a team.\u201d", "Establish a High Level of Trust", "\u201cI think Riot\u2019s success has largely been fueled by incredible people who are very committed to our mission and are willing to acknowledge mistakes and learn rapidly through failure because there\u2019s a lot of trust.\u201d", "Don\u2019t Get Discouraged", "\u201cYou\u2019re going to have days where you feel like you can take over the world, and there are so many possibilities, and then other days where you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my god, how are we possibly going to solve this problem. We\u2019re so in trouble.\u2019\u201d", "Interview by Nathan Chan, feature article reprinted from Foundr Magazine, by Erica Comitalo", "Nathan: The first question I ask everyone that comes on is how did you get your job?", "Marc: Well, the way I got my job at Riot essentially, was by starting the company. The way Riot got started was my business partner, Brandon Beck and I, are longtime friends. We essentially were college buddies. We went to the University of Southern California together. And we had two shared passions, one being gaming where we were both incredibly hardcore gamers, love playing games with each other and the other being business where we would sort of naturally default to the other guy to talk about interesting opportunities, but generally ended around gaming. In fact, when we were at USC, the first business plan we ever worked on was going to be for a company called the UGL or Ultimate Gaming League, where we wanted to build a tournament organising company back when we were 18, 19 years old, which was around 1999.", "And after college neither of us actually seriously considered a career in gaming because we both felt it was sort of a dream career and sort of irresponsible, ironically. And so I went into banking, he went into consulting and it was a pain. I was at Merrill Lynch and such in the US bank. And shortly thereafter, we then lived together and had an apartment in West Hollywood. And while we were there, we had these back to back gaming rigs and again, we\u2019d be playing games all the time. And the few times we\u2019d actually be home together, we\u2019d be playing games or sort of talking about games at the industry. And it was really that dynamic, which led to us thinking about how the game industry is going to be evolving.", "And we felt like we as passionate players of games had identified that we felt really underserved at the time. And so had a whole thesis about how to go create a company that could solve the problem that we deeply felt and put together a business plan and while working at our respective careers for sort of nine months, tried to talk ourselves out of it and then when we really couldn\u2019t, we said, well shoot, let\u2019s give it a go and see if we can make it work.", "Nathan: Interesting. This is your first business?", "Marc: Yes.", "Nathan: Okay.", "Marc: Yeah. Our first real business, essentially.", "Nathan: Okay. First real business and for a first time founder, you guys knocked out of the park. You\u2019ve got an incredible company. I\u2019m really keen to explore and go deeper with that because I\u2019m actually a gamer as well myself or not so much anymore. I don\u2019t know if you still game Marc, but I find it difficult to find the time. And so I only game when I go to my parents\u2019 place, when I go back for family dinner with my little brother, because I feel if I got a console or did game here at home where I now live I would just knock anything down because I\u2019ve got a really obsessive personality. I\u2019m an ex gamer, you could say. And that was always, it felt like a dream for me as well. It could be so cool to create your own game and everyone has their own ideas and it\u2019s like a bit of a pipe dream. What happened next? You had this business plan, you guys were both working in the corporate world, do you guys have a computer science background? Producing games is really costly, talk me through how did you make it work?", "Marc: Yeah. We were 24 and 25 at the time with no professional software development background or experience at all. And fast forward to today and it\u2019s virtually impossible to draw a line and be like, how did we possibly create \u2026 become Riot? Because knowing what we know now, we literally wouldn\u2019t have invested in ourselves back in the day. We ironically believe that our naive optimism was one of the incredibly important ingredients for success, which actually speaks to a lot of the challenges that we faced early on. We, of course, at least had the awareness to recognise that we would have a massive credibility hurdle, not to mention executed challenges, when we were putting together the business plan for Riot, we were essentially analysing the opportunity from three main dimensions.", "One is sort of where is the opportunity? What is our exact plan? And if we execute this thing, would it actually work? Is there demand in the market for what we want to go deliver? And then two, can we actually execute, how much capital we were going to raise, what\u2019s the type of expertise, how feasible it would be to want to put together a development team, to go execute what we\u2019re trying to do. And then third is could we actually attract the necessary capital to go in a fund the operations and fund this, get to this and win all signs. Again, pointed the S, we said, okay, what the heck, we\u2019re young, let\u2019s take the risk, jump ship from our respective careers and give it a go.", "But again, because we were not natives to this particular industry that meant we were obviously not that well known. We didn\u2019t have a name that was relevant and because we didn\u2019t raise a significant round of financing or what not, it was very hard for us to go recruit talent because everybody that\u2019s also great of course is in jobs, they\u2019re busy and they\u2019re doing important things. And in many cases we had to get creative to figure out how do we make ourselves attractive to great talent, to go execute on our vision while still also not telling everybody what we\u2019re trying to do. Because we were also naively at the time believing that what we were trying to do was proprietary and needed to be sort of tightly held to our best in which we have evolved our views on now.", "But at the time, that felt like a really important issue for us. And to make a long story short the first person that we wanted to bring in to the company and then we had to put on our slides to demonstrate to prospective investors was going to be somebody who had largely check that credibility box. And we knew of variety people in the video game business, but in order to go find an appropriate sort of CTO/executive producer, we originally worked through recruiter. And to make a very long story short, we found somebody who we really loved that seemed incredibly intelligent, had a great resume from two dimensions, both being an experienced engineer who had lead programmer titles on big relevant credits on big relevant titles.", "And then also had a publishing background, was a former SVP and a well known publisher. But long story short, shortly after working with this individual, once we get to convince him to come on board and put them on the slide and it\u2019ll help sort of check the box and be like, \u201cHey, this person ship lots of games, this is very doable.\u201d When working there was this natural divide that started to evolve in the office where Brandon and I would tend to favour and hire these inexperienced but really high aptitude, really high-potential interns that understood the types of content that we were really focused on creating. And in our view, sort of understood how the industry was going to be evolving. And I can come back to why the industry was evolving and how it\u2019s going to be disrupted momentarily.", "And then the experienced developers that this senior individual\u2019s bringing on, tended from our view to not be the calibre of the digitals that we would have been dissipated being necessary. But again, we would look at ourselves and being like, Hey, this individual and some of these other members of team are saying a lot of things that we don\u2019t think really makes a lot of sense, but we don\u2019t want to be these, \u201cbusiness guys who were getting too close too at development, trying to tell these professionals, you have a lot of experience how to go do things.\u201d However, statements like, we don\u2019t need a development schedule, really raise our, in a spidery sense, but that doesn\u2019t make any sense. And there were all these different signals that were happening and sort of a cultural divide again where there was sort of the youthful passion optimism that with some cynical, jaded, experienced individuals.", "And what it turned out to actually happen is the person that we had hired to go build and lead development for us, literally wanted to steal the company and had no intention of going to go build what we are trying to build and was behind our backs pitching other publishers to go build different titles for them.", "Nathan: Wow.", "Marc: And when we discovered that, that was a fascinating thing. But obviously we parted ways with the individual. And it was sort of a galvanising event that I think was critical for the longterm success of the organisation where we then had to really roll up our sleeves and be like, wow, okay, if we\u2019re going to have any chance of this thing working, we have to be close to every detail. We can\u2019t get snowballed. We have to figure out how to go learn and get deeply involved in every aspect of the business.", "And then that\u2019s when we really jumped in and got really close to development and had tried to launch or drive the team towards creating a demo video in such short term to demonstrate progress to investors to essentially keep the lights on. And anyway, that was a really galvanising event that helped teach Brandon and I that, when experienced individuals say like, \u201cOh, trust me, because my 20 years experience in this particular industry or this field means I know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d It\u2019s really important to say, well, enlighten us with your 20 years experience. Well, what does that mean? Or why, or help us understand the rationale. And if somebody can\u2019t articulate a good rationale for whatever it is they\u2019re doing, even if it\u2019s a deeply technical concept that\u2019s a red flag that is worth digging it on. Anyway, there\u2019s lots of stories I could get into, but we\u2019ve had many catastrophic situations that, in many ways, should have torpedoed the company.", "Nathan: Interesting. What happened next?", "Marc: Yeah. From there, after making progress and putting together this demo video, we were able to, we still had the issue of like, all right, how do we go really build the game that we\u2019re trying to build, and actually to take a step back and provide some context of what we\u2019re trying to do. Our view was that the video game business was going to be disrupted as it was transitioning from a primarily packaged goods software industry to a more service oriented model. And as end users have lots of deeply engaging games, Brandon and I felt underserved by a lot of the existing content because oftentimes the business model for developers and publishers at the time, they could only generate revenue by selling goods at retail for $60 in a box.", "Meanwhile, the communities that would be attached to a particular iteration of a prior version of the game would be like, \u201cHey, development team don\u2019t move off. We don\u2019t want the SQL, we want more of this game.\u201d There\u2019s lots of franchises that have had great success that over time, through too many skews have hurt themselves. If you think about, as an example, Guitar Hero, there was Guitar Hero I, Guitar Hero II, Guitar Hero III, Guitar Hero Aerosmith, Guitar Hero: Metallica, and meanwhile what the end user wanted was to just play Guitar Hero and have this great game where they can get new songs and they probably play with their friends or they could do it online and what not. And it was trying to raise a bunch of content.", "Nathan: \u2026they basically tried to raise LTV.", "Marc: Right. And trying to pack a bunch of content and some incremental feature enhancements to then justify another trip to retail to buy it, to spend another $6 for essentially a slight tweak of what is the same game, it was something that a lot of players were frustrated by. And a lot of that related to the publishers, often times focusing on the retail partners as their primary customer that they were trying to serve. And again, there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with that. And that was good business in a lot of ways at a time. But from our perspective that felt really bad, that\u2019s from a player perspective then that we thought that there was an opportunity to be like, let\u2019s forge or create a company that could forge a deep, authentic relationship with the audience we\u2019re trying to serve and then grow and evolve context brands with that community over time.", "And League of Legends was the proof point and sort of content thesis to prove out what that could look like and what the \u201cgame company the future\u201d could look like. Of course this has been far more successful than we ever imagined possible. And after putting together that demo and making progress we recognise that we didn\u2019t have the talent internally to take this game to build a high enough quality experience. And our biggest challenge was how do we get great people to come join this company? And we created an advisory board essentially to say how do we justify even getting a little bit of time from great experts who have big roles at different companies to get them to come spend time with some of our junior talent who we think is really smart, passionate but inexperienced.", "And that ended up doing a couple things. By creating an advisory board, we are able to give some free shares to talented professionals who thought it was fun to then come do some mentorship, give us advice, get under the hood a little bit, but then go back to their full time career. And as their circumstances would change and as our circumstances would change, it then created a situation where while they would initially tell us, no, when we wanted to give them offers. As that equation changed those eventually turned into yeses. And each new senior development hire that we brought on became a pretty critical inflexion point for the organisation. Our first real great game producer was a guy named Steve Snow who would ship multiple MMOs. And by bringing on Steve, he had deep relationships with lots of other professional developers who became more interested and more aware.", "And a lot of our inflexion points for the company were when we\u2019d bring on people like that. Tom Cadwell, who was original head of design and you still runs game design for us today, was from MIT and has a Kellogg MBA and was a lead designer on a Warcraft III, Blizzard and as we started getting great professionals, we started to learn what good looked like across all the critical game development competencies and then we would have them inspire our junior talent. We would then fill organisations around them. Scott Gelb was an absolutely critical technology hire where this is sort of crazy. But we also originally were pursuing a parallel financing strategy. We were simultaneously talking to game publishers at then also thinking about raising venture money.", "And the game publishers that we talked to at the time also thought our idea was insane because we\u2019d go talk to them and be like, Hey, yeah, we\u2019re going to build a game that\u2019s essentially 100% competitive multiplayer. And they\u2019re like, \u201cWait, you\u2019re going to have no single player and you want the game to be free and you\u2019re going to sell virtual goods. That\u2019s stupid. 80% of all game hours played are single player and you\u2019re going to nerf the market tremendously. And how could you possibly just buy a free game, that only works in Korea, blah, blah.\u201d A lot of the sort of nay-saying around core parts of the thesis, which actually then how does conclude, okay, wow, shoot, we actually can\u2019t go just be a game developer and work with a publisher that would do title financing. We had to go build our own publishing business, which meant we have to go raise Metro money, which then meant the scope was increasing significantly and which meant the complexity was increasing, which meant the amount of money we needed to raise is increasing.", "And post the creation of that demo, we needed to go evolve the company to become venture ready and evolve our business plan, flesh out what a publishing business would look like, flesh out more of a sort of venture ready business plan and-", "Nathan: And this is before you\u2019ve even launched?", "Marc: This is all before we launched.", "Nathan: Wow.", "Marc: Yeah we thought it was going to take about $3 million to finish League of Legends and build a company to take the market, took about 20. And we had no idea if we\u2019re going to be successful until spending about $17 million of other people\u2019s money and bringing the product to market and then starting to get validation, but we were able to get benchmark capital and first mark capital to come invest and do our series A.", "It was a $7 million round in 2008. And it was a trunch financing three and a half million upfront. And because we all mutually agreed that execution risk was one of our biggest challenges we reasonably put in a thousand concurrent user beta test as the milestone to get the second half of the financing. And the challenge there was in mid 2008, long story short, we had a philosophy where we definitely didn\u2019t want to have the not invented here syndrome that many companies have, where they get too precious about trying to develop tech themselves or assume that they\u2019re the best people in the world to go build whatever. We wanted to leverage the middleware market, but we dramatically underestimated the maturity in the video game and in particular, the online video game, middleware market at the time.", "We thought that engine technologies would be more readily available than they were. We thought that online store technologies would be more available because again, back until it\u2019s a six as a pre-cloud, the iPhone doesn\u2019t exist, Cloud computing wasn\u2019t a thing. And we had to go find a technology partner or build competency internally to build a robust enterprise style scalable platform business with account systems and massive data infrastructure and scalable chat and matchmaking and all sorts of complexity. And that\u2019s where bringing on Scott Gelb was a huge inflexion point. But we originally were trying to build that out of house and there was a company that was a startup that was founded by a bunch of guys from Stanford who were building a technology platform for id software\u2019s Quake arena or sorry, a Quake online, it was one of their games, an online version of their games.", "And we\u2019re like, wow, if John Carmack, who\u2019s the founding CTO of id, who\u2019s an incredible, legendary technologist, believes these guys are the right partner for him to build a back end, clearly there must be amazing. But long story short, after a year of working with them, we weren\u2019t making enough progress from a future or a velocity perspective, we were able to get under the hood, evaluate the technology when we brought on Scott and Scott\u2019s like, \u201cWell, what did you want this to do?\u201d And we described all the different things and he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s not even close.\u201d And we then had to tell the board, yeah, that million dollars we\u2019re spending and that year building an enterprise software platform, we have to throw it away and start over.", "Nathan: Wow.", "Marc: And we fully expected the board to pull the plug on the company and Brandon and I would\u2019ve been like, yes, we failed and it\u2019s totally our fault. And lesson learned, and sorry everybody, we do understand if they took the rest of the money back and but that wasn\u2019t the reaction. Fortunately, although everyone was really upset, of course, Mitch Lasky, who was the board member from benchmark capital, was the most experienced video game operator in the venture world. He was the CEO of JAMDAT, which is now EA mobiles, he was the former head of Worldwide Studios in publishing at activision. He had a lot of experience in games and he was like, \u201cYou guys don\u2019t have a catastrophic development failure in your model? Of course, they were going to do something like that. This is incredibly difficult. This is online youth development, let\u2019s see how the team reacts.\u201d", "And we essentially, but we had six months of cash. We had to build a team and build all the competency to then build a bare bones platform to then run a beta test, a to get a thousand concurrent players. And we had no idea we were doing. But we\u2019re able to pull it off. It\u2019s sort of a very long story, but everybody told themselves for, that the second half of 2008 but ironically, again, because everything that will go wrong. Our game was late and not as mature and sort of where we wanted it to be from a quality standpoint. It wasn\u2019t especially fun. The heart wasn\u2019t that good. We didn\u2019t want to expose the game to a Western audience to run an actual beta. We hired 1100 people in the Philippines and we hired people on bicycles to cruise around and instal the game on CD rom and these PC cafes to then have people login to then join the beta to then hit that thousand concurrent threshold. We did it with three weeks of cash left and we lived to fight another day.", "Nathan: Yeah. Wow. Then obviously you got the second round of funding. How long did it take until you launched? And I\u2019m curious, how the hell did you guys still hadn\u2019t proven yourself you didn\u2019t have that traction or track record to kind of build up this incredible boards and get these world-class investors to believe in you guys.", "Marc: Yeah, essentially what was our pitch to, how\u2019d we get these investors to believe in us?", "Nathan: Yeah.", "Marc: 50 VCs told us, no, almost everybody because a lot of people said you viewed what we were doing as content. And from one lens they\u2019re not wrong. But from another lens we essentially had a content thesis that we could serve a platform in behind and where League of Legends was viewed as sort of the proof point to sort of this broader company thesis around really high quality core games as a service to players all around the world. And League of Legends was the spiritual successor to a very popular online mod called a set amount of Warcraft III, which is called DotA Defence of the Ancients. And a number of the creators of that mod were on our team Ginsu who is, it\u2019s online handle for, you know one of the lead developers of DotA Allstars.", "And then Pendragon guy named Steve Mescon who had built this online community when he was 17 years old that numbered in the millions of people. And I think in VC speak, part of the parlance was, oh, there\u2019s a leveraged customer acquisition strategy where if you build this product that there\u2019s clearly a demand for a large amount of those players will then come switch to these improved product where you have a lot of credibility where it\u2019s on the game plays already sort of validated and proven out. But it\u2019s kind of this birth of this new genre. And obviously we wanted to, we viewed DotA as this proof point to this much broader genre opportunity. And because it was growing virally without any advertising dollars spent, despite having incredibly high barriers to entry.", "And that we thought that that also helped validate the thesis around games as a service and kind of building a relationship directly to players, but it wasn\u2019t happening in a commercial product. And we wanted to build the official commercial product that did that and then show how a real company that could control all aspects of the experience, not just some of the gameplay levers could deliver something great. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done with League of Legends and as we\u2019ve launched esports and a lot of the around game experiences to enhance it.", "Nathan: Yeah. Okay, Got you. That makes sense. You had an unfair, what were perceived it would be an unfair advantage with the team, like we do some of these incredible people that you convinced to join you on this mission.", "Marc: Yeah. And therefore the audience, essentially the players that we were targeting. And that essentially would create yeah, sort of step one for this multi year plan that Brandon is still working on.", "Nathan: I see. Talk to me around launch, when you guys launch League of Legends, did a go gangbusters to start with? Because as I said, I\u2019m out of the gaming world, but of course no of you guy, one of the largest games ever. Yeah, I\u2019d love to hear like what happened next.", "Marc: Yeah. 2009 was everybody stepping on the gas pedal, trying to get the game ready to put it out the door. We were going to be publishing legal items ourselves in North America. And then we partnered with a company called Goa, which was a subsidiary of France Telecom to publish the game in Europe. We\u2019re going to be live in four languages in Europe. It was French, English, Spanish, and German. And then we had also licenced the rights to League of Legends for China, which we\u2019re going to be publishing through 10 set. And part of the reason is because one, we also wanted the advances on future royalties because we wanted more cash to ensure we could continue to invest in the product to improve the quality. And because part of the challenge is that our whole business model was very unproven at the time also because our game was planning to be free and we were literally selling virtual goods.", "And one VC put it succinctly where they were like, wait, \u201cYou want to create a multiplayer battle arena game where a 19 year old dudes or our kids are college kids are going to be fighting each other, but then you\u2019re going to be making money by them playing dress up doll while they kill each other.\u201d And we\u2019re like, well, not really, but kind of. And they\u2019re like, \u201cyeah, good luck with that.\u201d But that\u2019s of course how we make our money. And that ended up working, but that was anything. And then anything from a sure bet at the time. And when we launched to your point, League of Legends was not Pokemon Go. This is not this instantaneous massive online. You had a massive success. It was each month we were kind of incrementally bigger than the next month.", "It was slow growth. It was a little bit viral. People would have fun and that may grow over time and I can come back to that. But leading up to launch in 2009 we continued to have lots of different challenges. We grew the team to about 55 people leading up to launch. We had one person for marketing, which you brought on maybe three months prior and all of our resources were focused on improving the game, proving the product and trying to bring it to market. And to that philosophy around trying to leverage middleware, we had an online store provider. They had another partner that we had brought in to our back end ecosystem. And to make a long story short, as we started getting into beta, the store would fall over at every new concurrency threshold where, we\u2019d get 500 users and then a thousand users and then the general users and it would just it\u2019d be slow and sluggish would fall over.", "It was a very feature rich store, but it had never been proven in any other commercial products. We were sort of their Guinea pig. To make a long story short, we tried to rip out lots of the heavy, unneeded features. We try to get source code and reverse engineer a bunch of things and try to help out. But we eventually concluded that it\u2019d be more efficient for us to build something from scratch. The problem was this was right around our launch date. And this was crazy because the store was the mechanism of our infrastructure that actually had a players wallet and account system to know who had what in their inventory. Not only could we not make any money, but we couldn\u2019t sell any products, anything.", "We couldn\u2019t have any content. But we had a ship date and the reason we had a ship date, which we also didn\u2019t even want to have and we wouldn\u2019t have it in natural online service world, but because there was so much stigma at the time and the industry around free games, no editors would actually cover games that were free because they were all sort of imported from Asia, low quality games that were maybe 10 years old.", "And we\u2019d go meet with editors and they\u2019d be like, \u201cHey, well, we\u2019d love to talk about you guys, whatever, but like is your game free?\u201d And we\u2019d say, you know what? Well we have a box. And they\u2019d be like, \u201cOh great, we can cover you.\u201d Because we ended up doing a box distribution deal for a small amount of units with THQ, which was a publishing partner at the time, which has been previously a multi billion dollar company now at a business, because they were pretty attached to the sort of retail based distribution model previously. And had a lot of licenced properties like the UFC, things like that. And but anyway, we had a bunch of boxes with THQ and because we had boxes, those boxes essentially were bundles of digital content, but that also then of course had the game installed on the CD.", "We would, we\u2019d have these $30 boxes at best buy. But the reason we did that was one, to have some quote credibility at the time around being a retail. We had shelf space, people could see us, but primarily it was media would actually give us attention to then have again, improve our credibility and eyeballs and awareness of us being a legitimate high quality title coming out. And long story short, there\u2019s just a million different issues that came up and in our been our experience. And it really was a necessity became the mobile invention of like, okay, we have a lot of constraints. How do we solve this problem anyway? And back to the store, we had that launch date, which I believe was yeah, October 27th was I retail date 2009. And our store was falling over.", "Two weeks prior we pulled out that store, started building around. And then from a player standpoint, we launched the game with launch party where every piece of content was available for free. And all players could play with everything unlocked for the first X number of weeks until we could build a store to then put it up online, but then manageable inventory. Yeah. And the cool thing about that actually was that, felt great for players. Made sense, more people got to attach to the game and it sort of accumulate some of the free currencies. Then once the store actually came online, they were then able to buy a bunch of more content than they would have otherwise, right at launch. It ended up working out great. But then from there again, we had a relatively small community, you\u2019d probably in the tens of thousands and then every month we\u2019d get incrementally bigger.", "But then meanwhile, part of the way legal editor became big was not because we were great at acquiring customers. We were great because we were great and not losing them. We ended up having the one of the lowest turn rates in the industry. And I can talk a lot about why and how we did that and how we still do that because it\u2019s still true today.", "Nathan: Yeah, I\u2019d love to hear that.", "Marc: One of the challenges right at that time, to the extent you\u2019re sitting here about this is Europe was not growing at all. North America was growing pretty steadily, but Europe was completely flat. And it was fascinating because again, Europe was being handled by our publishing partner. And to make a very very long story short we ended up publishing with go up in France at the time because we loved their BD guy. An individual named Nicolo Laurent, who we thought was incredibly smart, very very thoughtful really understood who we were trying to do. And also because they had the number one NMO at the time, which was for Europe, which is Dark Age of Camelot. They were a credible operator at decent size community.", "But with league of legends, unfortunately, weren\u2019t able to deliver the types of holistic high quality experiences that we were in terms of building a direct relationship with their player base, making the players feel like they were cared for, that there was hope and how to communicate in a way about the concerns and feedback that players would have, were being heard and acknowledged and then therefore improved as were present in the upcoming patch cadence.", "Another thing that was industry first was we were able to get on a very regular two-week patch cadence, which was very rapid and very difficult to pull off from the development team. But we thought it was incredibly necessary to ensure that our players had hope, that the game was going to be constantly improving. They would see not only like micro patches or hot fixes rapidly, but then also bigger batches of content or bigger fixes coming in a very regular cadence. And then also establishing this great relationship where they felt heard. They would have complaints, they would have issues, they would see things that they would want. We would listen, we would connect and we would improve the product with them. We were able to establish that well in North America, not in Europe. And that actually is sort of part of the core underlying answered your question around why was our turn low?", "It started because of this type of philosophy where we needed to develop this intimate relationship and trust with players. And we weren\u2019t able to do that in Europe through this third party publisher. And we then worked on how do we unwind the deal? And to make a long story short, we\u2019re able to hire Nicolo to then join our team. And because he understood their company, he was able to unwind the deal. And then we had 45 days to take over the service from them create a European entity, build an office, hire staff create servers, get the whole thing up enrolling in literally 45 days. And about on day 30 the Icelandic volcano erupted. Which then created a massive amount of soot in the air which then shut down our air travel.", "In order to get the hardware and networking infrastructure from the US to Europe in time to build our data centres went up, we had to route circuits and things like that. And if it\u2019s through Africa and sort of fly it around, we had some people go on planes and personally deliver some things. Again, it was sort of every hand on deck going crazy, trying to get the European service up. But once we got Europe up and we were able to hire some people from Goa that loved and loved what Riot was all about. We\u2019re able to sort of operate differently and demonstrate why quality service matters. Because the second we took it over, we started growing and then Europe started going faster even than North America. And then fast forward to today and we have millions and millions of players across both regions. It was pretty important for us to be able to get the rights back.", "Nathan: Interesting. Talk to me around the esports part of your business because this is massive. I\u2019ve seen some photos of the stadiums. This is like an Olympic level it\u2019s crazy. I\u2019d love to hear about that side of the business and how that all came about in the league.", "Marc: Yes, absolutely. Yes Brandon and I both grew up playing sports, being big sports fans, love most sports in general. And we always believed that competitive online games of a certain type had all of the same dynamics that quote real sports did. And we along with many many other players for a long time, we were sort of dreaming of a world where gaming a professional esports gaming would be recognised or sort of on par and respected in the way that mainstream sports are and that the athletes would be sort of treated with respect and valued and paid well and the production by be great and all that. But for us, that again was a pipe dream. We had no idea at that\u2019d be 30 years out but we believed it was inevitable.", "And but it\u2019d be incredibly arrogant to plan on League of Legends kind of being that game. But we always had a hope that we could deliver some great competitive experiences. And when we launched League of Legends, we didn\u2019t have ranked. And our first major update were because we do these to pack patch cadence where we\u2019d be adding characters, we\u2019d be doing balanced tweaks we\u2019d be adding incremental content but in July of 2010 we did a big update called Season 1. And this was time to be just before StarCraft II was coming out, which was essentially the sequel to the biggest and best PC game of all time, which we were absolutely terrified about from blizzard with the company we grew up loving and admiring and playing all their games.", "And their map editor from Warcraft III spawned DotA which helped sort of spawn the mobile genre, which League of Legends was inspired by and what not. Then they had this whole arcade plan with a great modding tools for the whole arcade ecosystem and StarCraft II. We were terrified about that. The positive aspect of that is it helped catalyse a team\u2019s focus around delivering a great Season 1 update. And the whole concept of coming up with seasons was to help frame and position the game as a sport. We were going to launch ranked and, which then had draught mode and felt more competitive, which was a new matchmaking cue, which would then segment our population of players.", "There is an account levelling mechanic where in order to prevent new players from being too overwhelmed by the massive amounts of content that exists on the League of Legends in the hybrid and the knowledge, we kind of breadcrumb it where there\u2019s only a couple of characters you can play and then you didn\u2019t have all these summoner spells and a lot of the hours around game decisions. But over time, as you got more familiar with the game, we\u2019d give you more options. And once everybody hit level 30 though, when people really started getting, really understanding the game, they wanted a higher, more competitive experience and we wanted a matchmaking cue where people that were really wanted to try hard and focus and have numbers that where the at ranking system that mattered could go into a rank cue. That\u2019s what rank is all about.", "And we had individual ranking with our solo cue, but then we had sort of a team rank where people could play five on five with friends against other teams. And then as part of the Season 1 announcement at launch, we announced that we were going to essentially create what has subsequently become sort of like the birth of our esports efforts, which was a tournament system focused on circuit points where different teams could go to approved events that third party providers could work with us to get approval to go run their own events. And then teams would go show up to the events and there would be a leaderboard that we would own. And at the end of the season, the top X number of teams would then go to a tournament. We would run at dream hack, which was a big land party in Yon shipping Sweden where it\u2019s one of the cool things in the world were literally 15,000 gamers show up to like this random town in the middle of Sweden in the middle of winter, you spring your own computer.", "And they play three days of just hardcore games and like nobody sleeps or if you do, you\u2019ve got to see the bag on your desk. It\u2019s amazing that, we hosted our first esports event there and it was our Season 1 world championships and that\u2019s where we had our volunteers shout casters like Freak and Rivington and Daniel Klein who are on our community team. We had really low budget graphics and it just really bad production value. But this was also the birth of the streaming ecosystem. Twitch TV wasn\u2019t even a thing yet. I think it was Justin TV at the time. And then there was another platform called OWN3D. And we didn\u2019t know which streaming platforms was going to really win or evolve. And we wanted to be on everything.", "But the numbers of online viewers that watched were really large. We had over a million people tune into watch, which blew our play where expectations there\u2019s $100,000 cash prize tournament. And anyway, for us, that was validation of like, wow, a lot of people are like us who really do want to watch games played at a competitive level. Now that we\u2019re growing, and we\u2019re having this momentum and we\u2019ve sort of validated this, how do we take this to the next level? And then come Season 2, we essentially had eight months to then figure out how to build what has now become the LCS which is League Championship. Essentially our league ecosystem, we now have 13 leagues around the world, but at the time we started this with two as North American LCS and EU LCS and Season 2 it was the first time we did events in arenas as well.", "And I think we also launched in Korea that year, which was 2012, or maybe that was early 2011, I actually forget exactly the timing, but the evolution of esports from season 1 to season 2 to season 3 to season 4 and beyond was incredibly rapid. And there\u2019s some graphics around in the internet that illustrate it pretty well. But I think if you do a search for like League of Legends season either one through four evolution or things like that, you\u2019d find some cool images. But we went essentially from having folding chairs at a land cafe to doing an event at the Galen Centre at USC to then a year later doing the world championships at the Staples Centre. And each year the world\u2019s became much more relevant because we had more leagues around the world that we\u2019re becoming more professional, where the top teams from each region would then qualify to go to essentially a world cup.", "And then the world championships was the finals of the five week World Cup tournament. And now it\u2019s, last year we had 98.6 million people watch our World Champions live.", "Nathan: Wow.", "Marc: Oh, sorry, 99.6, which was a little bit more than the super bowl at which not quite apples to apples because there are just a US number, but in ours as a global figure. But nonetheless, the scope enriches becoming really significant. And the average salary of a player just in North America, there\u2019s 50 starters on the teams, it\u2019s about 350 top player, last year made five and a half million dollars.", "Nathan: Wow.", "Marc: Sponsors are coming in all over the place. There\u2019s now a player in China who is sponsored by Nike, it\u2019s been a blessing to see it all evolve and then really come to fruition. But it\u2019s required an awful lot of blood, sweat and tears from an awful lot of people all over the world building, all of the different aspects of how to create a healthy league ecosystem like players associations, and team structures and partnership agreements and media rights and how do you hold players teams accountable, and teams accountable, how do you find them? I mean, it\u2019s been a really interesting experience.", "Nathan: Yeah. And I think this has been a big, would you say a big component, to really further fuel the growth of League of Legends? Would you say that because now you\u2019ve got this whole ecosystem, you\u2019ve got this whole tournament and from there, that\u2019s like a whole nother business?", "Marc: Yeah, it really is. It\u2019s a very different business, very different competency, but it does, the whole is greater than sum of its parts where as a league player, there\u2019s always something to watch, there\u2019s always something to talk about, there\u2019s interesting drama between teams, there\u2019s players in on pros to aspire to or in it to become fans of, there\u2019s events that are happening all around the world. There\u2019s stuff to watch when you don\u2019t want to play and you just want to watch, you can watch it on your phone. It\u2019s just like any other traditional sport, you have the talk radio circuit and there\u2019s podcasts and there\u2019s data to pour over and analyse and to theorise about who\u2019s going to win different leagues around the world. There\u2019s the international dynamic where just like in the World Cup, people get really nationalistic about cheering for team China or from a team from Korea versus teams from North America, Europe.", "There\u2019s a whole regional aspect and it just helps find the community in a really cool way and keep people engaged. And our business is fundamentally about keeping players entertained and engaged over the longterm. And our view is the only way to really do that is by delivering incredible value to them. Half of League of Legends players never spend any money and that\u2019s totally fine because from our perspective, their content for other users, the burden is on us to deliver an experience that is so cool or compelling that they want to spend money. And if it\u2019s not going to be in League of Legends, hey, maybe it\u2019s going to be in the comics that we\u2019re now doing with Marvel. Maybe it\u2019s going to be in future games that we\u2019re doing.", "But either way, we\u2019re always trying to take this long term relationship approach where we\u2019re cultivating trust. We\u2019re not only trying to work to League of Legends the game, but also the intellectual property, we\u2019ve ridden every asset in the game multiple times over now, we\u2019ve totally rehauled our engine, our tools, pipeline\u2019s way better. We\u2019ve grown the team, we\u2019re have 3000 people around the world and we really feel like we\u2019re just getting started and hopefully that\u2019ll be the case.", "Nathan: Yeah, that\u2019s really interesting. Something you were saying around a large portion of your community don\u2019t pay anything and that\u2019s totally fine. And I think it just comes down to, and you said how that could be perceived as a burden on you guys because fundamentally a transaction takes place when value exceeds price and that\u2019s totally fine. If you always think of it like that, really what you guys are really masterful at and people can take everything that you\u2019ve shared throughout this conversation around how do you build a community around a common goal? How do you build a community around a mission or a problem that you guys are trying to solve? And-", "Marc: For sure.", "Nathan: Yeah, that\u2019s interesting. Look, we have to work towards wrapping up Marc. I could talk to you all day, is fascinating stuff. Few last questions. One, what\u2019s next for you guys? And two, any kind of \u2026 Yeah, what\u2019s next for you guys? And really, any words of wisdom that you\u2019d like to share just to finish off?", "Marc: Sure. This is the year where we\u2019re celebrating the League of Legends 10 year anniversary, which is a sort of a really exciting time for us to take a look back but then also look forward about what\u2019s to come for League and whatnot. And the question around what\u2019s next, how I mentioned Rise is getting started. There\u2019s a lot of things that we\u2019re working on from League of Legends, the mobile perspective, there\u2019s a lot of different things that we\u2019re doing to try to expand the game and expand into multiple games. Riot is again, in Riot Game right now, we\u2019re not Riot Games, the S is still aspirational. But that\u2019ll change over time. And we\u2019re really trying to evolve the company from being the super focused company on League of Legends to be able to do more things that are still very much aligned with our mission and sort of more games genres and continue to improve our intellectual property and expand into different mediums, things like that.", "And that\u2019s all really hard to do, just like esports is, it all requires different competencies. We have to build a muscle, we have to take it slow and we\u2019ve had lots of failures and learnings as we\u2019re evolving in this journey. But it\u2019s exciting and to that end, building the organisation capable of delivering on all the ambitions and the possibilities that we have is a huge focus and a huge challenge. And I can talk about that all day long and I guess that would tie into the advice I\u2019d potentially give to anybody, which is our experience was really around in a sort of, there\u2019s a great Henry Ford quote, he says, if you think you can or you think you can\u2019t, you\u2019re right. And I think that is an important mindset to take as an entrepreneur where you\u2019re going to have days where you feel like you can take over the world and there\u2019s so many possibilities and then other days where you\u2019re like, Oh my God, how are we possibly going to solve this problem? We\u2019re so in trouble.", "And necessity is the mother of all invention. It creates the constraints, which often drive to, or the catalysing events for teams to come together to solve problems, which means in our view, and I think in many businesses, the team is by far and away the most valuable asset. Getting the right people, building the right culture, being thoughtful about mission and purpose. And who\u2019s motivated for self-interest versus the genuine mission of the company or sort of extrinsic rewards because they\u2019re primarily motivated by comp or sort of financial upside from options rather than what the company is here to do. Those are all really important things to evaluate when building a team.", "And obviously there\u2019s trade offs where you can\u2019t always get everybody 100% aligned to everything you want and you got to be practical, move forward. But I think Riot\u2019s success has largely been fueled by incredible people who are very committed to our mission and who are willing to acknowledge mistakes and learn rapidly through failure because there\u2019s a lot of trust. And building an organisation that feels safe and where there\u2019s a lot of trust is absolutely critical, which is really hard to do at scale. But if anybody\u2019s, a founder working on a company, having that deep sense of purpose and mission can really carry you through the darkest days and also carry you and your team to great heights.", "Nathan: Thank you so much, Marc. And it sounds like you guys have been through one hell of a journey and a that\u2019s been the guiding light that\u2019s kept you guys going and being super relentless with achieving your vision and mission.", "Marc: Well, thanks Nathan.

Right now my focus is on the creative direction for Beardbrand and trying to build a team that can, not just sustain itself without me, but to scale without me. We\u2019re in the business for about seven years now and we\u2019ve done a good job building the team and getting the right people in place.

I really want to delve a little bit deeper on that, but before I do, how did the company start? How\u2019d you come up with the idea? How\u2019d you bring it to life? Man, you\u2019ve got a really godly beards, so obviously you were looking to scratch your own itch or\u2026 Talk to me about that.", "Eric: Yeah. The journey starts way back in actually 2010 or 11, I used to be a financial advisor at a big bank and banks, especially back then, had a very conservative style to them. While it wasn\u2019t written down rules that you can\u2019t have any facial hair, it was strongly implied that you wanted to have no facial hair, wear a suit and tie. That wasn\u2019t me. I really hated working at the bank. I love financial advice, I love investing, but the bank life was not for me. I quit working there and I started growing my beard out, this was 2011. I was trying to start some other businesses on the side and I would still go to networking events, and always at the networking events they would be like, \u201cHey Duck Dynasty, or ZZ Top, or Grizzly Adams.\u201d These are all cool, historically notable bearded guys, but they\u2019re not me. They\u2019re not the type of person that I identify.", "I\u2019ve always viewed myself as an entrepreneur, or a designer, or a business person, and I didn\u2019t like being boxed into this other image.

I ended up going to this event where I started meeting other guys like me, stay-at-home dads, ministers, salespeople, doctors, lawyers who are all rocking beards, and they didn\u2019t really fit the traditional stereotype. I realised there was this community of people out there who didn\u2019t fit the traditional stereotype. I was just thinking about it, thinking about it, thinking about it. I was like, \u201cWho are these people? How do I describe them?\u201d That\u2019s when I came up with the name Urban Beardsman to describe the guys who didn\u2019t fit the traditional stereotype. Then Beardbrand was going to be the organisation that united that community of Urban Beardsman, and gave them the tools they needed to feel confident about their beard and their style.", "Because if you think about it, back then, 2011 and 12, doctors, and lawyers, and salesmen, it was strongly pressured to not have facial hair in the business environment, so wanted to change it.", "Nathan: Interesting. I think the whole bearded movement has grown as time has gone on. A lot of hipsters, that kind of movement. Back then was that very-", "Eric: No, I mean\u2026 At least at the time I lived in Spokane, I would be the only guy with a beard at a networking event. Not only that, I had a beard that was a pretty similar length to this back then, so it was very remarkable. When we started with Beardbrand, we started the community in 2012 and I posted some YouTube videos, and we had a Tumblr page, and I had a blog. Then I ended up meeting my current co-founders and I\u2019m like, \u201cHey guys, help me turn this online community into a business.\u201d They came on-board, we launched the business arm of Beardbrand in January 2013, and we started selling a product, beard oil. At the time I would just get people who would just laugh at me, \u201cWhy would you put oil for your beard? Or is it your beard\u2019s actual oils that you\u2019re bottling? What is this?\u201d", "It was, the first year of business I\u2019m going around educating people on the product, and how to use it, and the benefits it brings.

This is our number one product.\u201d Then the guy\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, but how\u2019s it different than this other product?\u201d It completely blew my mind because my strategy had to shift slightly from, \u201cWhat does the product do?\u201d To, \u201cWhy is your product different than other companies?\u201d That was a real shocking moment for me.

Now, I did it slightly cause I used to be in the printing world and it was more of marketing automation for , but I wasn\u2019t able to sell anyone that.", "The business actually shifted into what I was pretty good at, which was just designing websites. I\u2019d create WordPress websites and that\u2019s how I was actually able to build a strong relationship with Lindsey, my business partner, because I built her a website for one of her previous companies. She was having a struggle with her web developer and like, \u201cYeah, I can create this for you in a week for like 1500 bucks using a WordPress template and just getting your shit in there.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cOkay.\u201d She didn\u2019t really trust me because she\u2019d been going through this mess with this other person, and then I just knocked it out for her in no time.

In those early days it was, I had Sovereignty, which was my graphic design business. Then I had Beardbrand, which was this big vision that I had to unite a community, and then I had this beard club, Spokane Beard and Moustache Club, that I founded, then I had StartUp Spokane. I was your typical entrepreneur that had no direction, I was trying everything and seeing what stuck, but realistically I had no clue. We talked about it when I recorded the trailer for Foundr. Man, if only I had something like Foundr in the early days, I would know what I needed to do to have a successful business. I wanted so bad to be an entrepreneur, I just had no clue on how to do it right.", "The community, I don\u2019t know, I created like two or three. No, I guess that first year maybe I had six videos on YouTube and we grew to like 300 subscribers. When I say community, it\u2019s still very modest. Then the blog article wasn\u2019t really getting any\u2026 the blog wasn\u2019t really getting traffic, but it was the only blog out there and some reporter from the New York Times found it and then all of a sudden I was the expert because I was the only guy talking about beards.", "Nathan: Wow, crazy.", "Eric: Yeah, it\u2019s a little bit of luck, but also taking that risk to talk about something you\u2019re passionate about regardless if the audience is out there or not.", "Nathan: Yeah. Wow. Interesting. You then met Lindsey through-", "Eric: Yeah. A funny story about how Lindsey, and Jeremy, and I met. Lindsey and Jeremy are my co-founders. I met Lindsey first through Spokane Society of Young Professionals, just a networking event in Spokane. Then I had met Jeremy separately through another one of my projects which was Society of Libertarian Entrepreneurs. In a true fashion, Jeremy came to the coffee shop where we were meeting at to attend a Twitter meetup. He came for the Twitter meetup and just saw us talking about libertarian entrepreneurship kind of stuff. He was like, \u201cI\u2019m going to stick with you guys, screw those Twitter people.\u201d I learned about him and he\u2019s a pinnacle in the Spokane market with his business. He has a carpet cleaning business and he\u2019s just an amazing entrepreneur.", "I really enjoyed Jeremy, and I really enjoyed Lindsey, and then I talked to Lindsey about Jeremy. Lindsey had used Jeremy\u2019s business, but she had gotten a lousy employee who did a bad job, and she told me about that. She\u2019s like, \u201cJeremy runs a terrible business with Zerorez. They did a terrible job.\u201d I knew that and I told Jeremy when I first introduced Jeremy and Lindsey together. I\u2019m like, \u201cHey Jeremy, this is Lindsey. Your company did a terrible job with her. I\u2019m glad you guys can meet.\u201d It was the most awkward introduction. Then Jeremy went and did the right thing. He told her about the employee and how that employee is no longer with the company. He was disgruntled and went ahead and redid the cleaning for free and earned her graces from there. That\u2019s the start of our relationship, how we realised we get along well, we know how to solve problems, we\u2019re true to our word. Then ultimately I convinced them to do a Startup Weekend. Have you ever done one of those?", "Nathan: No. But I heard of it. Very familiar.", "Eric: Oh dude, for any new entrepreneur out there, it is one of the most amazing things and it really started to turn on my light bulb for how entrepreneurship works and how you feel ownership over the projects you\u2019re working on. We worked together on one of Lindsey\u2019s ideas. It was that Startup Weekend that we found out that we worked well together on this project. The project we didn\u2019t really have the capabilities and the resources to do in-house. It was a software app and none of us were software developers. I was like, \u201cHey, I got this Beardbrand thing and this New York Times reporter is going to quote me in an article. Why don\u2019t we turn that into something?\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cOkay.\u201d No, they knew what they\u2019re getting into. But yeah, that\u2019s the long introduction as to how we started our business, started our relationships.", "Nathan: Amazing. How\u2019d you come up with the oil? Because that\u2019s, still to this day, one of your flagship iconic products. I said to you over email, I had a moustache for a small period of my life a couple of years ago. My girlfriend made me get rid of it she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore-", "Eric: Oh man, I need to have a word with her. What\u2019s going on here?", "Nathan: But when I did, what do I do? I go to Beardbrand, I bought all the products, I even bought the brush. I bought the stuff that make it smell nice. I bought the special twirling, I could twirl it. I think I showed you pics man. The oils was the first product, which is one of your best sellers. How did you come up with that idea? What was the process there?", "Eric: Yeah, in those early days, bootstrap. I was bootstrapped to the T. Legitimately we had spent $30 into the business and I had a vendor supply our product. I said, \u201cHey, I want to buy like $100 of product.\u201d But we actually started getting sales before I had written him a check for that product. We were simply a e-commerce business to start off. We were just selling someone else\u2019s product, and that allowed us to be super lean. We started making money then of course just had your standard retail markups, keystoning it. Mark it up 100%-", "Nathan: ?", "Eric: No, it\u2019s his product, his brand. Yeah, we totally started with someone else\u2019s company. Then I\u2019d used the product for a while, it\u2019s a great product, it smells phenomenal. But I thought we could make our own product. We ended up making our own version that would really compliment that other product because we intended to carry both products. That oil was like a little bit heavier and it had probably a longer lasting fragrance and a little bit higher sheen, but I wanted a beard oil that you could feel it less in your beard. It wasn\u2019t as oily, it wasn\u2019t as greasy, a little bit lighter weight oil. We formulated it slightly different and developed our own fragrances, and we sold them side by side for a long period of time. Then that\u2019s really how we got started in the product business.", "Nathan: Interesting-", "Eric: Making our own product.", "Nathan: How\u2019d you get your first customer with the other product?", "Eric: What\u2019s funny is, the first customer I had in my graphic design business was this random woman in California. I don\u2019t even know how she found me, on LinkedIn or something like that. I had done some logo graphics for her. I don\u2019t even really know who she is. Then I posted on Facebook the day before the New York Times article went live and I said, \u201cHey, check it out. We got a brand new site.\u201d I guess we are connected on Facebook and she bought it for her son or something. My first customer for two of my businesses was the same person, and I have no idea really who this person is.

Let\u2019s talk about, fast forward to now, seven years, eight years later?", "Eric: Yeah. I mean, what year are we in? 2019 and we started 2013. We\u2019re on year number seven, I think. We\u2019ve had six full years.", "Nathan: Can we talk- \u2026 about traction? How far you\u2019ve brought the brand now. Anything you\u2019re willing to share, the traction and where you guys are at now. Starting from there to where you are now.", "Eric: Yeah. We\u2019re still a seven-figure business, seven-figure business I\u2019m trying to get it into eight figures. We have a team of about 15 team members located primarily in Austin. We do have one guy located in the UK. Lindsey is in the day-to-day business with me. Jeremy\u2019s more of like a board member and that\u2019s how it\u2019s been from day one. We\u2019ve maintained that. Then we do, about half of our distribution is direct on our website, beardbrand.com and then we have a major retailer in Target. We have exclusivity with one of our product offerings and they distribute those products in all their stores in America.", "Nathan: Interesting. When it comes to\u2026 You were on Shark Tank. How did all that come about? Talk to us about that experience-", "Eric: Oh yeah. Shark Tank. You should do it.", "Nathan: Was it worth it?", "Eric: Yeah, I\u2019d do it tenfold over. I thought it was a great experience.", "Nathan: You got a lot of sales?", "Eric: Yeah. I mean, for us it was a lot of sales and I was able to get exposure to a national audience. I still get people who talk about how they found out about us from Shark Tank and a lot of us tell our story and really the story of what we think the Urban Beardsman is and beard care should be, which boxed out a lot of our competitors from getting on the show as well, so we\u2019re excited about that. Spoiler alert, we didn\u2019t get any deal. We didn\u2019t even get an offer, which I thought was pretty crazy because in the research, what we had done from a sales performance was better than 95% of the people who had been on Shark Tank, and to do it completely bootstrapped is unheard of. But to each their own.", "Nathan: But it was a good experience, the sharks. Because I haven\u2019t seen it, it was good experience.", "Eric: Oh, yeah, yeah. I think the producers of the show were very transparent with what to expect. They were very clear, they left me as the entrepreneur to make the choices and make the offers that I wanted to make. They prepared me well. The sharks, I think the only thing I wasn\u2019t quite prepared for is, when you get on there, you deliver your pitch, and then they start talking. The first thing I wasn\u2019t expecting was that they would interrupt my pitch. Then the second thing I wasn\u2019t prepared is all five of them talk exactly at the same time, so they\u2019re all trying to get word in. If you watch the show, sometimes you\u2019ll see people go around like this. It\u2019s like, okay, that makes sense. They\u2019re not lost or confused, it\u2019s because five people are talking at once and they\u2019re trying to\u2026 who of the five people are you going to focus on?", "For me, we had a strategy to go in with either Daymond as our top shot, and then Mark Cuban as our second shot. We gave priority to Daymond for that, so whenever he would talk we would answer his questions first. I think, for any people who want to be on Shark Tank, take that as a lesson. To come in with a strategy like that, to highlight the people you want to do a deal with, and make sure you give them priority. Make sure that they feel like they can be invested in your brand and what you\u2019re trying to do.", "Nathan: Yeah. When it comes to Shark Tank, I\u2019ve heard that if your show airs or something, \u201cDo they get a percentage or something like that?\u201d", "Eric: No, that was season one and maybe season two, but Mark Cuban asked them to change it. That was changed very early on, so I didn\u2019t have to worry about that at all.", "Nathan: Got you. Awesome. Talk to me around\u2026 You said to me offline before we started, you\u2019ve got some crazy ambitions and plans. You wanted to start a barber shop.", "Eric: Yeah.", "Nathan: Yeah. Talk to us about that, why? I said to you as well, I\u2019m saying, this is something that a lot of e-commerce companies are doing to really build a very, very strong relationship with their audience. If you look at like Glossier or Everlane, they start online but then they have these either pop ups, or these flagship physical stores where they get people to come in, try the product, and they build this really, really deep relationship. I think Apple was a great example of that. They have these incredible flagship stores where people can go in, they try and it really, really builds a very deep relationship with the customer. Yeah. Is that the play or\u2026", "Eric: Yeah, I mean, I don\u2019t want to talk too much about it because we haven\u2019t actually done it, so it\u2019s more of theory and something that we hope to do. But it\u2019s no secret that if you go to our YouTube channel, we film a lot of videos in the barbershop and show what the barbershop experience is like. A common comment that we get in the comment section is people are like, \u201cMan, I wish we had a barbershop like this in my hometown. I just can\u2019t find a barber.\u201d There\u2019s definitely a need of people who want the experience that we\u2019re showing on YouTube and they just can\u2019t seem to find it locally. In addition to that, 2019, today is the world of Amazon.", "Let\u2019s be real, if you\u2019re an online merchant, how are you going to stand apart from Amazon? What are the things that Amazon\u2019s never going to do? We\u2019ve knocked out a lot of the things with incredible packaging. The stuff that we send out just looks amazing. We have tissue paper in there, we have samples in there, we have these, we call them\u2026 they\u2019re field notes, but they\u2019re just little memo pads that we give to our customers. Stuff that really enhances the brand and really enhances the experience. Amazon\u2019s never going to do that. But sometimes that\u2019s not a big enough moat. Some people just want it quick and cheap.", "Other options that we can do that Amazon\u2019s never going to do are experiences. The barbershop experience is a really easy shoo in for us, in theory, to be able to offer and enhance experience. Then of course introduce that audience to our products, and do it in a way that we can control, and tell the story, and make sure we educate them one-on-one. I think so many guys out there are completely in the dark when it comes to best skincare practises or haircare practises. They see these guys who look amazing and they just have no clue at all how to get that look and what it takes.", "We want to focus on building a barbershop that can deliver that experience and hire the right stylists and barbers and really coach them on what type of information a customer or a client is looking for when they sit in that chair, or at least with the Beardbrand experience. They can go to Great Clips or they can go to their local barbershop and get a really good haircut, but what we want to deliver is that education similar to how we deliver it on our YouTube channel.", "Nathan: Yeah, that\u2019s super cool. It\u2019s another thing. Even myself, when I think about it, I used to go to hairdressers, but now everyone goes to barber shops. It\u2019s a massive thing.", "Eric: I think talent is talent and it doesn\u2019t matter the licence if they\u2019re stylist or a barber. In America, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some barbers and stylists that are watching are like, \u201cOh no, it\u2019s the end of the world to go to one or the other,\u201d and they do have their benefits, but there are a lot of stylists and barbers who are cross-trained as well, who can do both the razor shaves as well as the fades, which are really popular at the barbershop, but then to do the scissor work as well, to have the complex haircutting abilities if that\u2019s the route they want to go.", "Nathan: One thing you said is, you said offline you treat as an MVP. Eventually you might have hundreds if not thousands of barbershops, and it could be a really, really strong differentiator and a moat that you guys can build around your brand. You said you\u2019ve tried a few different things and you\u2019ve tried all sorts of other things. What are some of the things you tried that perhaps didn\u2019t work? I\u2019m really curious.", "Eric: Yeah, I mean, one of the things we did early on when we had about four SKUs or six SKUs, we were like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take over the world.\u201d We went to London, and Belfast, and Glasgow and we ended up opening up a 3PL, a third party fulfilment, in Belfast. Belfast? Belstaf? Belfast. We opened that up and then, we also, a few months later, we ended up going to Australia. We went to Melbourne and Sydney as well to try to find fulfilment partners, and then we realised that in Australia it\u2019s like $8 to ship within the country when it\u2019s like $11 to ship from America to Australia. It\u2019s like, \u201cThis is crazy. I don\u2019t know what you guys are paying money for you all. Where all that money goes, but it\u2019s crazy.\u201d", "Anyways, we did end up setting up our distribution centre in Belfast and it was always like the red-headed stepchild for us. A lot of times products would be out of stock there. Then as we launched new products, maybe we\u2019d have it for the American market, but wouldn\u2019t have it in the UK market. We thought that people in Europe would just simply buy the same way that Americans buy. We found that languages are different. I mean, who knew that, in France they don\u2019t speak English, they speak French? We thought, \u201cOh yeah, we\u2019ll just be in Belfast and just serve all of Europe and they\u2019ll all buy the same.\u201d We realised that that market is a lot more complex and it requires a lot more investment. As our SKUs got significant, like we\u2019re up to 120 skews, managing that, and the logistics of that, and having multiple fulfilment centres was just too much for us, so this year we pulled out.", "Speaking of things that we\u2019ve pulled out. We used to sell on Amazon through a third party. We were able to pull out of Amazon last year and that was a great boost to our business as well. I think we\u2019re one of the few companies out there who\u2019s like, \u201cOh yeah, we pulled off Amazon and doubled our online sales.\u201d It\u2019s not very common in the e-commerce space to not be on Amazon.", "Nathan: You\u2019re saying you\u2019re not on Amazon no more?", "Eric: No.", "Nathan: Why?", "Eric: The only thing that you can buy from Beardbrand on Amazon are either stolen goods, counterfeit products, or arbitrage plays where they\u2019re buying it from our store and reselling it on Amazon, so you\u2019re just paying up the wazoo. But the reason why is, people would buy\u2026 they would come and search for Beardbrand products like let\u2019s say our Tree Ranger Utility Balm. They would first search on our store and then they\u2019d go to Amazon, which I think is a very common trait for a lot of people. They\u2019d find that product on Amazon, and then Amazon would recommend XYZ company brush or XYZ company comb, and they\u2019d buy this other company\u2019s products and our utility balm, and then they would go on their day in life.", "What happens is, on Amazon we\u2019d have like a $25 average order value, whereas if we didn\u2019t sell on Amazon and they could only get it from beardbrand.com, then they buy our utility balm, and then they buy our brush, and our comb, or the other products that we\u2019re also offering. We have like an average order value of like around 50 bucks for our store, which is significantly higher than on Amazon. Simply, keeping those customers who are our customers, they\u2019re searching for our brand, and then not paying Amazon for that commission-", "Nathan: Yeah, margin. Yeah.", "Eric: To be fair, if you\u2019re not very strong in your brand, if you\u2019re not doing content marketing, then you\u2019re not going to be afforded that luxury. You need to be able to create your own brand where people are actually searching for your product, otherwise you\u2019re always going to be tied into the sales performance of Amazon. To be fair, I know of other companies in our space who, they can tonnes of money on Amazon. It\u2019s a great place to make money and I don\u2019t want to discount it, but it doesn\u2019t have to be the way to go if you want to build a brand, if you want to build content marketing, if you want to bring a lot of value to your customers.", "Nathan: Yeah. That\u2019s a good segue. Let\u2019s talk about content because, average order value of $50, a lot of companies, and a lot of people they get into the e-comm space, they just want to do pure media buying. Some of the best media buyers out there are people that are doing Facebook ads and buying media for e-commerce businesses because the margins are so thin. But with the average order value of around $50, that can be tough to make margin. You\u2019ve got a few different options. You can either do influencer marketing via social media, or you can do content marketing, which is\u2026 it\u2019s similar around that same path around content. That\u2019s something you\u2019ve done very, very well, and effectively it\u2019s allowed you to pay $0 to acquire customers. Obviously, you\u2019ve got-", "Eric: Our time.-", "Nathan: Yeah, you\u2019ve got-", "Eric: We\u2019ve to pay for our time.", "Nathan: Yeah, you\u2019ve got to pay for your time, but you\u2019re essentially creating these assets. You\u2019re planting these seeds and over time they grow. That\u2019s what I love about YouTube, which is something that we\u2019re really trying to get into now is, there\u2019s just so much more shelf life when you create a video. We created a video which was an interview that we did like six, seven months ago and it\u2019s got over 200,000 views. That\u2019s just a gift that keeps giving. You guys have got over a million subscribers just on YouTube alone, a few hundred thousand on Instagram. You\u2019ve probably got quite a decent amount of traffic going to your blog. This is traffic that\u2019s all coming organically, that you not paying for, and it\u2019s really high intent-based quality traffic. When I say traffic, these are people that are interested in your products, so it\u2019s an incredibly powerful way. You feel that vibration.", "Eric: Did you just get an order?", "Nathan: Yeah, yeah, yeah-", "Eric: Shopify. All right. Give me some money.", "Nathan: Basically, let\u2019s talk about that. If people want to get started, they\u2019ve got an e-commerce business, or they\u2019ve got a product that isn\u2019t a high ticket product and they want to use content, how can they get started? What channel do you choose? Is it Instagram? Is it YouTube? How do you know what channel to choose?", "Eric: Yeah, I mean. To give some concrete numbers, I ran into a guy who was selling apparel and we talked about media buying or Facebook ads. He\u2019s willing to spend 125 bucks to acquire a customer whereas on our end with a $50 AOV, for us to be profitable we\u2019ve got to spend like 25 bucks. Yeah, you could factor in customer lifetime value, but as a bootstrap company that\u2019s not sitting on piles of cash, we\u2019ve got to be a little more conservative, or I prefer to be a little more conservative so we try to keep it around that $25. If everyone\u2019s paying $125 to acquire customers, it\u2019s just not going to be possible for us in the long run.", "Content marketing was essentially our only option in those early days. We didn\u2019t have cash to put in the business. It started with sharing our story on Reddit. It started with reaching out to people on Twitter and sharing our products with influencers and not paying them for it. It\u2019s like, \u201cIf you like it, talk about it. If not, I understand. That\u2019s fine. That\u2019s cool. I\u2019m not going to bug you.\u201d Then of course on YouTube, creating content, that\u2019s the only thing we could really do. It really is like compounding interest, financial advisor in my past life. I love the power of compounding interest and content marketing is like that. It gets stronger and stronger every single year the more content you crank into it, and it starts to stand on itself.", "YouTube has been such a big driver for us. We\u2019ve done a post-purchase survey where 65% of our customers first heard about us from YouTube. You think about that. Two thirds of our business, a seven-figure business is coming from YouTube. What we had to pay for that is, yeah, my time to record the videos, I\u2019ve got a video editor, I\u2019ve got a camera man. We pay guests and collaborators and stuff like that, but compared to\u2026 I want to say it\u2019s less than what we pay Facebook in a month, but it\u2019s like that. It\u2019s significantly lower than the amount we\u2019re paying Facebook, and Facebook\u2019s only driving a small bit.", "Nathan: How do people know what channel to choose?", "Eric: I think you look at yourself and what you like to do. Are you more of an audio person, then maybe podcasting is the way to go. Are you more of a writer, introvert. Do you like to express yourself through words? Then blogging is a great way to go. Then of course, if you\u2019re narcissistic like me and you like to be in front of the camera, then video is a great source for you. Going onto the visual side of the introverts, we have photography. Do you like to put the camera in front of your face and then be able to capture the world? Photography is a great way to go. But let me also say that video, you don\u2019t always have to be in front of the camera. You can tell stories, and do animation, and create video in many different ways. Let me say, you don\u2019t have to be a narcissist like me to want to go the video route.", "It really just is dependent on what you\u2019re interested in, where that passion is. Because content marketing for it to be successful, while it does build up over time, it also doesn\u2019t do anything in the beginning. You really have to stoke that fire and get it going, and you get it going by creating 20, or 40, or 50 pieces of content. That starts to build that foundation.", "Nathan: Talk to me about, I guess, what is good content to you?", "Eric: Yeah, I mean good content is the content that achieves the goal that we\u2019re going after. Sometimes we have content that is there to inspire people. It\u2019s not going to drive any sales, it\u2019s just there to help build awareness to the brand, and then other good content is stuff that drives sales and gets engagement or gets people talking and spreading the word. I think it\u2019s important that whenever you create content, you know what the expectation for that content is going to be. We think about it as a funnel. We have your content at the top, that is there to bring awareness to the brand. Then the middle is to introduce the products, and then the bottom is, now you want to buy the products. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s enhancing your life, go and make it happen. Here\u2019s your call to action.", "Nathan: You have different pieces of content for different steps of the funnel.", "Eric: Yeah, I mean, depending on the medium. If we\u2019re blogging, we have some articles that are like 10,000 words, so you can really have your whole funnel within that one article. But if it\u2019s a video, typically the videos are generally split up based on that content funnel, but there will be integrations into it or at the outro we\u2019ll make a little call to action or something like that. But the main purpose of the video isn\u2019t necessarily for the bottom of funnel, it\u2019d be more top of the funnel.", "Nathan: Yeah. Actually, I\u2019m just thinking, I think when I was looking for the best way to groom your moustache or something. That\u2019s how I reconnected and purchase from you guys. I\u2019m pretty sure. Do you have an epic article on that? You must. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, see that\u2019s crazy.", "Eric: I hope so yeah.", "Nathan: Yeah, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s how I reconnected.", "Eric: That\u2019s the thing that you may or may not realise as a creator or a founder is that yes, 65% of our customers first found out about us through YouTube, but it was the Facebook ads, or the blog, or the email newsletter that really helped them become a customer. That\u2019s how you think about, \u201cMan, I wish it was just people watched the video and then they buy from me.\u201d But, it\u2019s like going on dates with girls, or guys if that\u2019s your cup of tea. You\u2019re usually not banging on the first night. You got to go on a few dates first and get to know each other. The same happens with a brand and your products, and your customers.", "Nathan: Talk to me about all the pieces of content you create. You guys create a lot of content. It\u2019s built a lot of goodwill in the marketplace, in the market that you serve, fostered your community in a big way. What are some of the best pieces of content that you\u2019ve created that has just absolutely destroyed it for you?", "Eric: We create so much content, we have 1,000 videos. We take the strategy of quantity over quality. Our goal is to just really get it out there and let the YouTube algorithm grab hold of some of them. We\u2019ll have some amazing videos that just fall flat on their face, that we\u2019re really proud of and we think they\u2019re going to do a good job for our viewers. Then we have some that are, \u201cWell, just throw it up there. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Our number one video is one of those where like, \u201cHey, we should get into maybe style stuff for our audience.\u201d We had Carlos rip some jeans to show how to do distressed denim. After three months I had like 2000 views and all of our comments were like, \u201cThis is terrible. Why would you ruin a good pair of jeans. You\u2019re terrible.\u201d It was like, \u201cOkay guys, we get it. You\u2019re not really interested in style stuff.\u201d Then like eight months into the video it got picked up by the YouTube algorithm and it\u2019s super popular in India and Pakistan, and now it has like 5 million views.", "Sometimes, especially on YouTube, you just never know what could happen. But we\u2019ve got some great collaborators. Greg Berzinsky is one of our collaborators who\u2019s produced some great videos for us where he really does a good transformation of his beard and makes it from this bird\u2019s nest messy beard into this very well sculpted beard. I think that\u2019s bringing a lot of awareness to guys on how they can start to control their beard. Jeff Buoncristiano, another New Yorker, I just met up with him yesterday. Great guy, he\u2019s created tonnes of great content for us in the past. For me, I wish there was this one piece of content that just blew it out of the water because then I would just do a million of them, but maybe that\u2019s what we have. We have tonnes of great content that all work in their own way to drive traffic and business through our store.", "Nathan: Yeah. One thing, yeah, I\u2019ve noticed you guys do a good job with on YouTube is, it\u2019s not just you. I think sometimes, because we\u2019ve got these big rise of the personal brand, Gary Vs, you got to have your personal brand. But I think that can\u2026 you got to be careful there, because you don\u2019t want to have your company too attached to you because then you haven\u2019t built really a scalable asset. This is something that you were talking about at the start of this interview. You want to build a company that can run without you, and I believe-", "Eric: Grow without me.", "Nathan: Yeah-", "Eric: They can run without me now-", "Nathan: Run and grow. Yeah. It\u2019s like Apple for example. Unfortunately Steve jobs passed, that company still grows and prospers. Yes, there\u2019s been some problems with obviously innovation bits and pieces, but still that company is still one of the most profitable companies in the world. I think that\u2019s the job of every founder. They should be able to build a incredible, well-oiled machine that is a value-generating machine. Were you strategic when you have these different collaborators that you\u2019re introducing into the channel, it\u2019s not just fully about you, like a Casey Neistat. Talk to me about that.", "Eric: Yeah, absolutely. Our core values are freedom, hunger and trust. Freedom for me means that I don\u2019t have to be tied to the business. Of course, if I don\u2019t want to be tied to the business, I can\u2019t be the only personality for the business. Not only that, I think about my family. If something ever happens to me where I die, I don\u2019t want my business to implode because I\u2019m no longer the face of the company. I get a little paranoid as I get older and I\u2019m thinking about death and I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, if I\u2019m going to die, I want the business to still be able to grow and support my family, provide for my family without me being there.\u201d", "Yeah, I have no intentions of selling the business, it\u2019s a great business. But if something ever happens where I would want to sell the business, no one\u2019s going to want to buy a business where you have one person who\u2019s the face of the company. You would sell the business and then you\u2019d have to spend the next three or five years trying to get yourself out of the business. If I ever want to sell the business, it\u2019s like, \u201cYou give me the check, you have it all. It\u2019s your problem now.\u201d I want that freedom. To me, selling something and coming along with it seems crazy.", "It\u2019s been important for us for that one reason, but not only that, to support our community. Because not every guy has a red beard, blonde haired, is tall and skinny. We got bigger guys, we got bald guys, we got older gentlemen who have silver beards. We\u2019ve got brown beards, curly beards, black guys. We have all that type of content to really show, and try to provide value to all men really of all different walks of lives.", "Nathan: Yeah. I love it. We got 10 minutes. We have to work towards wrapping up. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts around anyone that\u2019s watching this and they\u2019re thinking, \u201cWell, I want to start an e-commerce business. Don\u2019t know where to start. Got tonnes of different ideas working perhaps with many different ideas in their head like how you were launching, trying different things. What pieces of advice would you give?", "Eric: Yeah, I mean, I\u2019m a big believer in having business partners. I know I\u2019ve talked to other business partners or other people out there who have had horror stories with business partners, but if you can find business partners who align with you philosophically, now that\u2019s the key. You don\u2019t want to find business partners who compliment your work talent. You want to find business partners who see the world the same way that you see the world. If that\u2019s aligned, you guys will be able to solve any problem. It doesn\u2019t even matter if you guys have the exact same skills.", "In fact, Jeremy, Lindsey, and I, we all have the exact same personality. We\u2019re all salespeople, we\u2019re all ideas people. There\u2019s no operational person, but we are aligned in the philosophy for what we want to do in the business. Yeah, it means that the business was probably held back a little bit because we\u2019re slow to get systems and processes in place because none of us wanted to do it, but we\u2019ve always been able to maintain our partnership together and support each other. Because business is a long, lonely road, and if you\u2019re in it by yourself, you\u2019re going to hit dark times.", "For me personally, when I hit those dark times with my previous businesses, I couldn\u2019t get out. It was, that was it and the business was over. Whereas now when I hit those dark times, Lindsey will remind me, or Jeremy will remind me that, \u201cHey, here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. This is just a blip. Is this going to matter in a year?\u201d And you\u2019re like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s probably not going to matter in a year and we\u2019ll get through it and we\u2019ll bounce back, we\u2019ll figure it out, we\u2019ll get the right team.\u201d", "For me it\u2019s been crucial to have those people. Now, you can\u2019t. What I did wrong for 10 years was, I would try to get my brother to start a business with me. I tried to get my co-workers to start a business with me. I tried to get my dad to start a business with me. I\u2019d be like, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s do it, let\u2019s do it. It\u2019s going to be great. We\u2019ll control our future.\u201d But the reality is, you can\u2019t change people. They are who they are. Yeah, they\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, I want a business, that\u2019s great. I\u2019d love the freedom. Blah, blah, blah.\u201d Yeah, bullshit. They don\u2019t want to give up the security they have and they don\u2019t really want to grind like is required to start a business.", "Instead of trying to convince people to start a business, I learned to just start hanging out with other people who like businesses. That\u2019s when I started doing things like Startup Weekend, and going to entrepreneur-related events, and all of a sudden I\u2019m like, \u201cOh wow, I\u2019m around entrepreneurs, and they want to start businesses, and they\u2019re willing to start businesses. They understand how we can affect the world and change the world, and they\u2019re willing to take risk.\u201d That was just huge for me. Really, the only reason that Beardbrand is successful today is because I have two business partners who are amazing people. That is the only reason. If it we\u2019re just me, it would be another one of my side projects that never went anywhere.", "Nathan: You guys obviously did a test project together, but how do you know that even if the test project goes well, it\u2019s going to work out or\u2026", "Eric: Yeah, I mean, I think it goes back to those philosophies, how do you see the world? I mean even, are people good or bad? Things like that. We believe that people are good, and there\u2019s the small percentage of people who are bad.

Our mission\u2019s really been our north star for us, our guiding light. Our mission currently is, we make men look and feel awesome. We believe that when we make men look and feel awesome, they have the confidence to take on the world, to become better husbands, to become better, employees or entrepreneurs, to become better people, to lose weight, and ultimately that\u2019s going to make the world better. We have a grassroots strategy for making the world better rather than some politician at the top telling everyone to be better.

I mean, I just got an Instagram message today from a guy who\u2019s telling me how\u2026 It gives me chills how our videos have helped them become a better place.

Well actually no, two last questions.", "Eric: Five more questions.", "Nathan: Two more questions. First one is, just best piece of advice. Anything that I didn\u2019t ask you that you wanted me to ask you, anything you want to share? Just parting words of wisdom.

So we needed to come up with a way to solve that, frankly, for our own survival.\u201d", "The solution?", "Something Munro calls visual identity calibration.", "This phrase describes a system in which a brand enters its information and describes its identity to Flashstock, and then the Flashstock team puts the brand through an exercise to pin them down on the right details. The end product is a well defined set of creative variables, which Flashstock then provides to their freelancers to create new, on-brand content.", "The system garnered great feedback and has been praised for its innovation in solving this communication pain point. So much so, that some companies have even used a lot of these tools internally to communicate with each other, according to Munro.", "Around 2014, Instagram really began to open up its platform for anyone to be able to post and create company pages, and major brands wanted to get in on the action.

At FlashStock, we helped large brands create marketing content, specifically images, videos, stop motion by using software and a global network of freelance contributors. So Shutterstock acquired us to basically compliment their product portfolio. If you think of stock photography, it\u2019s all pre-shot, it\u2019s all sitting there in the library. A lot of organisations want a unique look and feel, they want to tell their unique story, and so it complimented what they do by acquiring us.", "Nathan: Yeah, amazing. So you were working on FlashStock for about four or five years.", "Grant: Yeah, that\u2019s right.", "Nathan: Was that your first company? Or how did that come about?", "Grant: Yeah, so I\u2019m sure like many of your listeners, for a long time I had an aspiration to start my own company. I worked at a big company, and decided to do an MBA, and nothing really felt quite right. Then I joined a startup in Toronto, Canada, and the startup was basically like a boutique social media agency. This was back in 2007, 2008, where Facebook and Instagram was this new thing. So I joined the company as a product person because of my background in software engineering, and product marketing, and product development to help them figure out if they could find any products to productize, and solutions to productize so they could build more recurring fast type revenue, because most of their revenue was professional services. So I was interested in the job because I really enjoy the customer development aspect of it, and I think that\u2019s one of the key skills for any entrepreneur to develop, is really understanding the customer and what they need and what they do every day.", "So I jumped at the opportunity, ad spent a bunch of time talking to a bunch of clients around some of the pain points around digital, and content management, and analytics. Even though they were providing just professional services, they had some really great logos and brands that they were working with, and basically built out the first set of requirements for what blossomed into the social media management category, of Sprinkler and those types of tools, we were a competitor of them at the time.", "As that part of the business started to grow, so as the product revenue started to grow, they started to cut away some of the traditional creative agency professional services they were providing. So one of the areas was content production, and so they viewed that as something that wasn\u2019t a good type of revenue that they wanted to continue, so they discontinued offering it. And because we were providing content mostly for social at the time, and some digital stuff, the clients were very unhappy about this. Which me, not having a true creative background, coming more from tech, I was quite surprised because I assumed that their agency would take care of it, or their other stakeholders that were part of the process. But there was something about social being a lifestyle, and being this sort of low cost, quick turnaround, really agile sort of shop we had created, it really hit home. So once they got rid of it, the clients were always asking for different solutions around content.", "So I\u2019m the VP of digital for a big brand, they\u2019re going to be running contests and creating promotions all geared at acquiring all of this content, and so this niggling thing that just never went away, they got to the point and I was like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to start a company, and it seems like a pretty good one.\u201d So basically, ended my role there, and sort of rolled over and started FlashStock pretty much the next week. We went to some of the early clients from the previous company that had requested help on the content side, and offered up a solution that would basically connect them through some software that I wrote directly to freelancers all around the world, and so I was able to acquire a few early customers, and then refine the product, and went from there and so pretty quick growth.", "We were not really sure about the positioning for a while. We had some early customers sort of dabbling between agency and big brand, and then around 2014, 2015, Instagram was available for all to use, but they hadn\u2019t really turned on the monetization piece yet. So every organisation wanted to be on the platform, but because there was no paid promotion behind it, they wanted the cost of the content to be as close to zero as possible. So this really nice window opened up where if you provided on-brand, on-brief custom content at a much lower cost, I was really able to compliment what a traditional creative agency was doing and not really be a competitive threat because they didn\u2019t want to create that type of content.", "Then, of course, as soon as Instagram started to turn on their app platform, then brands could promote, we started to see the dynamic shift where if you\u2019re content really native to a specific channel, regardless of cost, you\u2019ve got a pretty good advantage over some of the larger companies that have been doing it for a while. So it skyrocketed from that customer acquisition perspective, continued to grow, and then eventually we met with the Shutterstock team, and the rest is history, as they say.", "Nathan: Yeah, wow, interesting. When it came to, I guess you said the early days you had a few years on the platform. What changed? Did you speak to them? What created that kind of pivot?", "Grant: Yeah, so when I initially started the company, the positioning was all around an alternative to stock, and that\u2019s sort of what the first press release was, and that was what the product was geared to, and we were trying to sell the solution to heads of marketing. And actually, this was the first time where marketing positioning really hit home for me in terms of the ability to tweak the positioning to see the product, and the product doesn\u2019t change, but the positioning changes, and all of a sudden you\u2019re selling much faster and much easier.", "So I noticed the value prop would kind of resonate with an agency, and so, \u201cHey, why are you using stock? There\u2019s all these challenges with the rights management. Why don\u2019t you create your own custom content? You own the style, you own the creative, you own the messaging, you own everything. It\u2019s a better alternative.\u201d It was doing okay with the agency folks, but the brands were not interested in it at all.", "This was more of the big corporate clients, who didn\u2019t really probably have a lot of experience with stock, and so they kind of heard the term stock and sort of immediately shut down and weren\u2019t overly interested because they probably had a provider, and they didn\u2019t really go too deep.", "As Instagram came about, and crazy growth, brands were really late onto the platform, the narrative was more about storytelling, and visual storytelling, so started to see that if we tweaked the positioning and started to talk about helping brands tell their stories in a unique way using differentiated content at a much lower cost than at scale, we could potentially sort of escape this stock thing that was bogging us down from a positioning perspective.", "We did that, and it, overnight, sort of changed the sales velocity. Then, you know, really started to double down on if you\u2019re a brand and you want to create content, you\u2019re going to have a unique look and feel, and so you want your creative assets to look visually different, and consistent, than the competitors. So we spent a lot of time and engineering effort really trying to figure out a process to help a big brand explain to us what they meant by their look and feel, and the brand guidelines, and the style guides in a really condensed and concise way, so that we could then use that to communicate to the contributors and the freelancers who were all around the world creating the content based on these brand-specific briefs.", "Those two things really started to accelerate on the go-to market side.", "Nathan: Yeah, I see. When it comes to kind of the content that the freelancers and influencers, et cetera, would create, is it more kind of \u2026 I know it\u2019s custom and visual. Was it kind of usually UGC type stuff?", "Grant: Initially, it definitely was a bit more heavily weighted to feel like UGC. I\u2019ll give you an example. Our first customer ever, and this was when I kind of felt we were onto something, is when I was able to sign a contract with Anheuser-Busch Budweiser for a three month pilot. And if you think of Budweiser, they\u2019re a big national brand, global brand, everywhere. The way they sort of set up the marketing structures is they\u2019ll have the global brand, then they\u2019ll have the national level brand, and then they\u2019ll have the regional brands. So if you think of the continental United States, similar to Australia, it\u2019s a huge country with very diverse regions. They thought that rather than taking the national level content, so the same piece of content that you would use no matter what US state you were in, rather than doing that, they would create regional content, specific to a region.", "For example, if you are on Coast of the United States, it\u2019s very, very cold winters, so tonnes of snow. If you\u2019re on the West Coast at the same time of year, it\u2019s sunny and beaches. Thought, \u201cHey, if I\u2019m serving my East Coast consumer with ads that show people playing beach volleyball drinking Budweiser, would that perform better or worse than if I serve them ads of people drinking beer in the snow when it\u2019s snowy on the East Coast?\u201d So the pilot was all around creating this lifestyle-like content with real people consuming their product in certain scenarios, but really, really regionalized to that area, and then serving up ads based on those regions to test out if local content and lifestyles content really performed better. And it did, and then we went on, had a big relationship with Anheuser-Busch.", "But that\u2019s an example where it\u2019s like high-quality UGC, where it\u2019s the consumer telling the story of the brand with the product, with the right requirements, and with the right safety regulations, and all the stuff that goes into branding. That\u2019s kind of the holy grail for them, is the quality is right. In order to get the quality right, you can\u2019t take any piece of UGC, it has to be at the right production level.", "If you think about alcohol as a category, for example, you can\u2019t show more than one beverage per person in the photo. Like, you can\u2019t show a table of six empty Budweisers, because responsible drinking, and the bottle has to be full. So there\u2019s all these requirements that make it really hard to get actual UGC content. But when you nail it using freelance photographer, and real people who they know, and they\u2019ve got that authentic flair, and they can style the photo, it works really well.", "Nathan: I see, interesting. So yeah, this two-sided marketplace is quite unique in that aspect because, yeah, you work with brands to create custom content and visual content at scale. So tell me around kind of two-sided marketplaces are difficult because you\u2019re marketing, and you have to get users on both sides of the table, from a supply side, and also a kind of demand side. How is it different between the two? And which did you find easier in the early days to add onto the marketplace?", "Grant: Yeah, good question. So a couple things, sort of a couple principles in that. First and foremost, if we sort of segment different types of marketplaces, so really simply, there\u2019s marketplaces that are created for large organisations to use, and then there\u2019s marketplaces that are created for individuals to use. I\u2019m a huge fan of 99designs, I think they\u2019re a great product, great company, great people. But they actually designed the logo for FlashStock.", "Nathan: There you go!", "Grant: Yeah, which existed, which hopefully exists for a long time now. But if you think of the process where I\u2019m a freelancer, and I\u2019m using a marketplace to add additional services, \u201cI need a logo,\u201d or, \u201cI need some design work,\u201d or, \u201cI need a photograph,\u201d the way that that marketplace dynamic works is I post a request or a search through the directory and pick a person, and then negotiate the delivery dates, requirements, and then they provide me the deliverable, and I make a decision about whether or not I take it. So I take a lot of the responsibility on, and the marketplace obviously provides a lot of value, but at the end of the day, I\u2019m responsible for quality control, I\u2019m responsible for all these aspects.", "On the enterprise side, what we see is big organisations, they don\u2019t want to do that. They basically want to think of a marketplace as almost like a staff augmentation, where they want to ensure that the quality is high, so they don\u2019t want to spend time searching directory, they don\u2019t want to spend time QAing assets, they don\u2019t want to spend time negotiating all this stuff for individual things, they want it more like a service.", "So for us, we try to categorise it as content as a service, where we\u2019ll basically put a layer of management and quality control between you and the marketplace, and so there\u2019s no notion of bidding, or contests, or spec work. It\u2019s like you give us the requirements, and then we\u2019ll use our network to fulfil it. So from the client\u2019s perspective, they could ensure that the quality was there, the quality was consistent. Why that\u2019s important is obviously for us to acquire an enterprise customer takes a lot of work, and so you think of the cost of acquisition there can be quite high because they\u2019re big enterprise brands, and there\u2019s procurement.", "So for us, in order to do that, we have to provide those guarantees of that level of service. In doing so, we acquire a customer, and then once we\u2019ve got the customer, we\u2019ve basically got a job that we have to do on their behalf. So when you have that job, it\u2019s relatively easy, and I say relatively because it\u2019s not that easy, but it\u2019s relatively easy to go around and find someone who\u2019s willing to do it. The nuance is in the quality and the consistency.", "So when you think about do you start on the demand side or the supply side, because our target from day one was the enterprise customer, the hardest part of that workflow tends to be the acquisition of that customer, so getting that customer to commit to a body of work. Once they\u2019ve done that, you\u2019re basically tendering a job to a large number of people, and based on their skillset, quite a few people will ultimately quit if they\u2019re ahead.", "So even in the early days, when we were pretty short on the photographer side, and we were trying to scale up our operations, offering people paid work that wasn\u2019t spec work was a bit of a feather in our cap, and made things very, very easy, and then we could be relatively picky in terms of who we chose to ultimately work on the project. Whereas when you\u2019re doing more on the consumer marketplace, although I don\u2019t have a tonne of experience, my sense is that you sort of have to balance those plates a little more closely, versus us, where you get 10 or 20 big customers, and that would get us a tonne of work that we could then use to build up the supply side.", "Nathan: Yeah, got you. So you\u2019re using the software to facilitate the, you would say, kind of the up and back, and the account management, but you were still using it kind of like as a productized service with the software. Right?", "Grant: Yeah, exactly. For example, if I\u2019m a brand manager working on a big global brand, I don\u2019t want to spend time going through 100 assets where I\u2019ll only use 25. I want you to show me the best 25 because I\u2019ve got 50,000 other things to do. So there was a human element in them, but the data, the workflow, the tools to interface with the brand, that\u2019s all productized, but there\u2019s still the need for someone who understands what a good image is, look at that image, and make a judgement . Our clients aren\u2019t bogged down with unusable content.", "Nathan: I see. In the early days, like you talked about, kind of that slight pivot in positioning, and you\u2019ve seen that positioning can be very, very powerful in a way to kind of turn on the tap to really get traction. I\u2019m curious around kind of what are some other specific roadblocks to look out for when you are scaling a business?", "Grant: Yeah, I think the biggest one, the biggest thing I see, I think this is across companies of any size, from the person sitting in a basement trying to figure out what they want to do, is it\u2019s depending too much on serendipity and luck when they come up with a product idea, and so not really taking the time to build their expertise and confidence around how you talk to a potential customer, how you find out what they do every day, how you find out what their pain points are, how they talk, how they think, the emotions when they\u2019re speaking. So all of this sort of sits in that customer development space.", "For me, that has always been the path to success for a startup, your ability to talk to a bunch of different people that you think are your potential customer segment, and be able to assess if the thing that you\u2019ve got as a solution that sits in your head is going to solve a really important problem fr them. I see a lot of people who also come up with an idea and think that that\u2019s the idea, and then just frantically trying to find a home for that idea, but the reality is that it\u2019s very, very rare that anyone comes up with a product or a solution on a whim and doesn\u2019t continually iterate on it. And if you don\u2019t really spend a tonne of time thinking about how you actually talk to customers and validate that what you\u2019re doing actually solves an important problem, you\u2019re going to face a tonne of challenges down the road.", "This is, like when you\u2019re a small company, thinking about how do you talk to customers, how do you teach the other employees to talk to customers, to ask them questions, to get them comfortable asking questions? Where do you store that information? How do you use that information to look at your product roadmap, to your sales enablement, to your marketing positioning? Super simple example, you raise some money, you build a product, you acquire first few customers, now you need to acquire more customers. What do you do? How do you reach out to them? So with those early customers, if you\u2019re asking them, \u201cWhat marketing events do you go to? How did you find us? What blogs do you read?\u201d All of hat stuff becomes super important to feed into the go-to market.", "I feel like a lot of that gets overlooked at companies of all sizes, where they almost have to reinvent the wheel every time they want to launch a new campaign because they haven\u2019t created that discipline around customer development.", "Nathan: Yeah, I think that\u2019s so, so key. Yeah, even like that lean startup methodology and mindset is so, so important.", "Grant: Exactly. But systematising it across your organisation is really, really important. Actually, an interesting thing happened with FlashStock. I told you that story where I was working at this other company, and basically servicing the exact same customer that FlashStock ultimately served. That was my customer development, so that was my time with the potential customer, really earning my insight, and really understanding what some of the challenges were, and how they speak, and what they care about, and what they don\u2019t care about so that when I finally went to market, I stood a little bit ahead of the pack because I had spent so much time thinking about them.", "When the company started to grow, so when FlashStock started to grow, I went from being the voice of the customer, and so when we were three or four people, a new employee would start, and I would spend a bunch of time with them, and I would explain to them about the customer, and why they buy, and the problems that we solve, and I would do that until they got it. Then, the bigger we got, we went from 10 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 100, I was spending less and less time with the customer because I was starting to focus more on if you were a big customer, and a lot of internal stuff.", "I felt that because we hadn\u2019t implemented any sort of structure and cadence around enabling other people to absorb that language and that knowledge from our customers, it became a real hindrance in product, and culture, and basically every function. So the need to think about that early on, and make sure that, \u201cHey, if this salesperson is talking to a customer, and learns something new about that customer, there\u2019s a way for them to feed that learning back into the machine, and it doesn\u2019t get lost in a Salesforce report, or just goes out the person\u2019s other ear.\u201d That is something I think is really important.", "Nathan: Yeah, I agree. Often overlooked, often neglected, and something people don\u2019t really want to do. It\u2019s kind of scary, right?", "Grant: Yes, totally. It\u2019s like compounding interest. You don\u2019t really see the immediate benefit, and it benefits you a little down the road, so it really takes a lot of discipline to do it, but also a lot of confidence that you\u2019re going to be around when it\u2019s going to pay off in the future.", "Nathan: Yeah, that\u2019s right, because we\u2019ve got to okay ours, and it\u2019s all about what are the projects, what is the theme for the quarter, how are we going to increase revenue, reduce churn, et cetera, et cetera.", "Grant: Exactly, yeah.", "Nathan: Okay, well look, I\u2019d love to kind of switch gears, because I want to talk to you about creativity. When you first started out, you had your co-founder, Mindy, and across the two of you guys, you guys had to wear many different hats. I\u2019d just love to know kind of how you used creativity around wearing those different hats to kind of get traction, because so many people are starting businesses, but it\u2019s often very, very tough to get traction. I\u2019d love to hear your take there.", "Grant: Yeah, I mean, I think creativity kind of comes from a couple different parts, so I\u2019ll kind of address this on two sides. I think sort of to be truly creative, you need to \u2026 In this sense, it\u2019s like creatively solving a problem for your client, so it\u2019s offering them a novel solution that they haven\u2019t necessarily seen before that\u2019s solving an important problem. From an invention, innovation perspective, sort of address that.", "Not to beat a dead horse, but when you have a deep \u2026 when you have that aha moment, the typical time that you have it is when you\u2019re having your shower, and you\u2019re thinking about something that\u2019s not very cognitively challenging, and your cognitive load is very low, and then all of a sudden you\u2019re like, \u201cOh yeah, I should sort of do that.\u201d To get to that state, you really have to spend a lot of time thinking about a problem, understanding the ecosystem of that problem, and making all of that stuff super intrinsic so that when it kind of opens up your opportunity to have those flashpoints, and then because you\u2019re so familiar with it all, you can sort of dive into the solution.", "One of our biggest differentiators, as I mentioned, was this notion of visual identity. If I\u2019m a big organisation and I have this abstract notion of what the brand is, and the typical thing is we\u2019re selling to millennials, and we are aspirational, and really, really, really generic things that are really hard to understand in terms of very, very technical terms. And if you\u2019re a big organisation, it\u2019s usually okay because when you\u2019re creating content, you\u2019re usually with people that are creating it. But when you\u2019re in this networked world, where you\u2019re communicating through software and you\u2019re never talking to people, that level of ambiguity breaks the system.", "We needed to come up with a way to solve that, frankly for our own survival. So in looking at the problem and having the deep understanding of the problem, we could be pretty free and creative with the solutions. So we came up with this really simple thing called visual identity calibration, where the brand inputs all that stuff that they have, and then we take them through an exercise where the output is a really defined and succinct set of creative variables, like technical aspects, like lighting and angles, to environments, to the types of people so that I could hand basically a one-pager to any photographer anywhere in the world, and they\u2019d quickly understand it.", "So for the customer, they thought that was amazing. They thought that was super creative, and it solved a huge pain point, and they started to use a lot of the tools internally to communicate with each other versus just through us. That is a differentiator for us, it continues to be a differentiator, and it continues to be referenced as a sort of innovative solution to a well known problem. But where that really stemmed from was deep, deep knowledge of the problem that we\u2019re solving, and the freedom to go out and solution against it. If you\u2019re trying to copy a competitor or you just come up with an idea but you didn\u2019t really earn that insight, you\u2019re really not going to be able to be innovative or creative because you don\u2019t have the foundational understanding of what the problem is.", "Then, from another perspective, one of the really interesting things that I learned through FlashStock is we were ultimately a photography business, a video business, and so we were dealing in the creative. So there is a group of people that love working in the creative field, be it music, be it art, be it painting, be it photography, be it videography. And I found that, for the first time ever, the company culture was all centred around creativity. You would have salespeople, sales development people going to lunch with software engineers.", "And I had never been in a company where that happened so fluid, and it was because they had this common interest around creativity, and a lot of the people that we were attracting were attracted to that field. Then when we got the whole group together, which obviously was wonderful, but it took me by surprise, and we had a lot of people coming into the office and commenting on it, being like, \u201cAh, I can\u2019t believe how well everyone gets along.\u201d And I couldn\u2019t take any credit for it, it was more because we were working in a domain that tended to attract a lot of like-minded people across all these different disciplines. So it was this really nice, cross-functional, diverse group, which again seeds a lot of the creativity, and seeds a lot of the other things.", "Nathan: Yeah, that\u2019s fascinating. So because you guys were working with creatives, effectively was that, do you think, also fostering a culture of creativity?", "Grant: Yeah, for sure. I mean, everything from the marketing collateral, to the style, everything, if you have that creative eye, and you are critical of creativity and aesthetics, and you\u2019re thinking about it, it bleeds in. There\u2019s no way it\u2019s not bleeding in. And managing hundreds of creative people is exhilarating. It can be more challenging, but it\u2019s pretty wild.", "Nathan: Yeah, that\u2019s amazing. For anyone listening that is building their company, is there any kind of experiences you could share besides having a product that is working with creatives around creativity? How can people foster culture of creativity in their organisation? Because I think that\u2019s where some of the best ideas come from, where people are in the same room, and they\u2019re just kind of having like idea sex, and just you get the things that can take you to the next level.", "Grant: Yeah, the thing that comes to mind there is, so I kind of told you how I started the company, and I was working at this company, and I saw the problem, and iterated on a few solutions, and all of these external things happened, like Instagram, and started to get a lot of traction. So our growth was very, very fast. In 2014, at the end of 2014, we were five people, at the end of \u201915, we were 15 people, and at the end of \u201916, we were 80 people.", "Nathan: Yeah, wow.", "Grant: The hiring growth was pretty high. In order to do that, you have to have a lot of systems in place, which we didn\u2019t have. And I remember, it was early in 2016, and I think we were 50 or 60 people, so it was people overflowing in this small office space, out the window, and I was getting a tonne of questions around, \u201cWhat are we doing? What\u2019s the strategy? What\u2019s the longterm vision?\u201d I would see people that were behaving inappropriately, that I wasn\u2019t necessarily directly involved with the interview, and I\u2019d think, \u201cWhy is that person here?\u201d So I realised that we had never actually formally defined any of this stuff, and it wasn\u2019t a natural thing for me to do. I never worked in a company that had no culture, that had no foundational stuff done, so I didn\u2019t really appreciate it.", "But talking to a bunch of people, they said, \u201cYeah, just go and define your vision and your mission and your values.\u201d So keep in mind, we were 60 people at this point, 60, 70 people, and so it felt kind of awkward to go and do that, because we\u2019re already sort of in the race, and off and running. But I decided to do it, and we basically took some of the original founding team, so some of the early people, as well as some of the more senior people who had just joined, and we went off-site, and we said, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to spend a day, and we\u2019re going to get a third party facilitator, and we want to fortify our vision, our mission, and our values.\u201d", "So we went through this exercise, and I was honestly a little sceptical of the process. I was doing it more because, for me, it was I keep getting these questions, so if I can stop that, that\u2019s a win. And I felt the culture was good, and I honestly felt the vision question was a little \u2026 I get personally frustrated by it. So we ended up doing it, and I was recommended a facilitator that turned out to be amazing, and it completely changed the company in a matter of weeks.", "So we formally defined the vision, which was revolutionising the global exchange of creativity. We formally defined the mission. And we formally defined five or six values. These were really important to everyone who was part of it, because they were part of the communication, and they were part of the ones that were developing it, so they really owned it, and they really internalised it, which was big.", "Then we came back to the office, and the other 45, 50 people knew we were doing this, so there was a bit of suspense, and it felt a little anti-climatic, but we presented it all, and then we ran some exercises where we got the team to read the values, think about them, and list behaviours, good and bad, that you would think would meet this value or that wouldn\u2019t meet that value. We used the output of that to formulate an employee handbook.", "Why that had such an immediate change is vision and mission was like number one, are you passionate about that? Is that something that\u2019s meaningful to you? You could explain it to someone, and you could ask them, look them in the eye and say, \u201cIs this important to you? If it\u2019s not, then you shouldn\u2019t be here. You should find something that is important to you. But if it is, fantastic.\u201d Then you\u2019d have a set of values that were basically the rules of the road, you either follow them or you don\u2019t. So we would hire by them, we would fire by them. If there were internal questions around whether or not we should share a piece of information, it could be financial, it could be board, one of our value things that we would reference these things to make decisions.", "So what that did is it simplified everything. We would reference them all the time. So what that did, from a creativity perspective, people feel really comfortable, people feel really consistent, people feel really welcomed their ideas based on the culture, and it sort of freed up their thinking, not worrying about all that little stuff, worry about the real stuff. So by providing those guardrails and that framework, it freed up the right part of the brain so that they could ultimately go out and be creative.", "Nathan: Yeah, wow, that\u2019s incredible. Thank you for sharing. One more question on the creativity side is what\u2019s your advice for creatives or people that have a creative talent to start a business? Because I think, you know, you talked about that one side of the brain that\u2019s really creative, and then the other side is kind of, you got to be structural, right? And there\u2019s things that a lot of creatives may not be interested in, like finances, invoicing, going out there, getting clients, dealing with clients, dealing with customers. Like the fun stuff is the building the product, you know?", "Grant: Yeah. So we\u2019ve heard of that. It\u2019s not something that sits just with creatives, it\u2019s with highly technical people as well, and I think it\u2019s just a human trait. When things start to get challenging, what you tend to do if you don\u2019t have any help is to revert back to what you\u2019re most comfortable with. So I\u2019m a PhD researcher in computer science, working on cutting edge machine learning algorithms, but I\u2019ve had a technical breakthrough. If I go out and try to acquire customers and that becomes difficult to me, when I get really frustrated, I\u2019m going to go back and start coding. It\u2019s like, that is not going to help you move your business forward, and help you commercialise your idea.", "I see the same thing on the creative side, where people \u2026 In that engineering example, the engineer says, \u201cWell, I\u2019m a technical person. I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d And so you basically just labelled yourself as this technical person, that you\u2019re not willing to do that, and you almost create these rigid blocks around yourself. Same thing on the creative side. You say, \u201cAh, I\u2019m a creative. I don\u2019t want to deal with finance.\u201d In many respects, that feels like a bit of a bias and a bit of a cop-out.", "So in these cases, I would highly recommend that if people are struggling with that, to find someone that is not a creative or not a technical person, who has sort of commercialised the business, or has done something in the area that you\u2019re struggling with, and talk through your priorities. What we tend to see, and you see this all the time with startups, is they want it to work, they\u2019ve got the energy, they\u2019ve got the hustle, but they\u2019re just prioritising the wrong things because they haven\u2019t necessarily spent the time thinking about how to sell, or thinking about how to set up finance.", "So when you talk through your current priorities with people who have sort of done it and been there, they can help you recalibrate those, and they can help you say, \u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t need to write another line of code. You don\u2019t need to tweak your designs anymore. What you need to do is set up your accounting software.\u201d It\u2019s just like, \u201cYou got to get these invoices out, so you got to get cash in.\u201d But I\u2019ve seen that be really, really effective in helping people get over those humps and those biases.", "Nathan: Yeah, I see. I\u2019d love to just kind of switch gears and work towards wrapping up, Grant. I could talk to you all day, man, but mindful of your time. Want to talk to you about kind of post-acquisition, you sold your baby. How come you came to that decision? Do you feel comfortable with change of name to, obviously, Shutterstock Custom? Just curious.", "Grant: Yeah, the process of deciding to sell, at the time that we sold, we sold in June 2017, we hadn\u2019t done any formal fundraising, so we had raised about three million in seed funding from friends and family, and angel investors. We were at the point, so we were about 100 people, cash was obviously an ongoing concern, we were living off our customer receipts. And we felt that we were adding too much risk on the business to keep running it, and continuing as we were running it, we were growing like crazy, so we decided, \u201cHey, we should probably look at different ways to get cash into the company.\u201d", "Obviously there was the traditional VC route, with a formal Series A, which we were well-positioned to do, or there was bank loans, and loans against AR. So there\u2019s all these different vehicles to go out and raise money, and so we were probably most geared toward venture capital. As we were talking to \u2026 An interesting thing that I learned is if you\u2019re a VC and you\u2019re trying to find a company to invest in, one of the tricks is they go to LinkedIn, and they\u2019ll have a sort of thesis on the geography. So we\u2019re Canadian, and they\u2019ll say, \u201cShow me all the companies in Toronto that have had high headcount growth that haven\u2019t raised a lot of money.\u201d That sort of allows them to identify companies from the sweet spot.", "But because, interestingly, because we were a freelance company with a global network, a lot of our freelancers were putting themselves as employees of ours on LinkedIn, and so it made us look like we had this crazy high headcount, and only raised this tiny amount of money, which wasn\u2019t actually true. I mean, we still had a big headcount and very little money, but it was exaggerated. So the inbound for venture was through the roof, and I was getting 10 inbounds from 201 VCs. So having conversations with them and sort of explaining what we were doing, and they were getting very excited, and they were talking about check sizes.", "Then, a thing when you raise money, is it sort of set the goalposts. You push the goalposts out further, and further, and further. So if you were to raise 25 million, 50 million, an acceptable valuation when you raise that type of money is a significant one, and the probability of the sort of liquidity advance at that size, the bigger you get, get smaller, and smaller, and smaller. So I sort of, personally, because we hadn\u2019t taken on much capital, and there was very little dilution, I was sort of struggling with whether or not I wanted to do this. I mean, can I go for the fences? Or I just kind of keep building this sustainable growth?", "That\u2019s when Shutterstock reached out to us, and I met with the team, and they were explaining their vision, and their mission, and it seemed very similar to us, and they had a very similar culture, and decided that the probability of us achieving what we wanted to achieve was probably higher if we\u2019re together than if we\u2019re doing it alone. And so just \u2026 to go that route.", "Nathan: Yeah, fascinating. Okay. Awesome. Do you plan on working on something new in the future? Or what is your thoughts there?", "Grant: Yeah, so right now I\u2019m still with Shutterstock, and I plan to be with Shutterstock for some time. One of the great things, when you\u2019re a startup, you\u2019re out there doing it alone, and sort of fighting for your life, and then if someone takes you under the fold like Shutterstock has, they provide you a tonne of resources. So we\u2019ve got a bunch of unfinished business that we have left to take care of, but once you\u2019re an entrepreneur, it\u2019s very, very hard to go back, so I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be new ventures in the future, but for the time being, I\u2019m going to keep building with Shutterstock.", "Nathan: Yeah, amazing. So do you still run Shutterstock Custom? Do you still run that particular product?", "Grant: Yeah. So Custom is a business unit within Shutterstock, so Shutterstock is trying to build a bunch of different products to serve the creative professional. Custom is one of them, and it is structured as a business unit. When they bought us, they changed our name from FlashStock to Shutterstock Custom. So yeah, no ego there, that is \u2026 you know, you bought it you do what you will, but it makes sense from a brand hierarchy perspective. Yeah, it\u2019s kind of nice to see how it\u2019s all sort of fitting in together.", "Nathan: And did you think that this would happen fairly \u2026 you know, four or five years isn\u2019t that long a period of time. One thing that one of my mentors has often shared with me is he says, \u201cNathan, it takes at least seven to 10 years to build anything of true worth and significance.\u201d You guys-", "Grant: Yeah.", "Nathan: \u2026 yeah, fairly fast.", "Grant: Yeah, it was super fast. So a couple things there, I think in total, it was just under four years, so our growth was very fast. And then you have the relationship after the acquisition, so it\u2019ll be closer, I think it is now closer to six or seven. So understanding that timeframe when you come out is super, super important. But now that I sort of talked to a bunch of startups who are just getting started, one of the things that becomes important in that conversation is the type of company that you want to build. And I didn\u2019t think about this, and most people don\u2019t think about this because they\u2019re thinking about survival, but there\u2019s a very few number of companies that should be venture-backed. If you think of what the profile of what a venture-backed company is, they\u2019re in a huge market where you\u2019re going to get crazy growth, and quick scale, and there\u2019s going to be a huge, hundreds and hundreds of billion dollar return.", "But the reality of that happening is so low just based on statistics and base rate that you really have to think about what you want to sign up for, because when you take that big check, that big valuation, you\u2019re limiting your options, which may be fine if that\u2019s what you want to do, but it may not be fine.

Most entrepreneurs and founders are massively dissatisfied with their previous life, and have some mental health things they want to deal with, and they\u2019re not a normal cohort, but it\u2019s life.

And you spend time in Silicon Valley, it\u2019s like there is only one path, and it\u2019s to raise a bunch of money, and raise as much as possible, and run as fast as possible, and sort of run right directly into a brick wall. It\u2019s really easy to get caught up in that and say, \u201cOh, there is only one path.

You can immediately tell that these themes are more polished, although the average premium theme is around $200.", "Customizing the look of your store is very easy with 3dcart\u2019s visual editor, which means you can click and edit specific components of your store.

Also, I haven\u2019t found any other ecommerce platform offering more robust reporting data natively, with 3dcart being able to to track basic metrics like your customer and inventory levels, but also reports on your marketing efforts.", "Depending on who you talk to, 3dcart is either amazing at their customer support or the absolute worst.

Ecommerce is rewarding because it gives you access to so many more customers.", "You need to get out there and test all your experiments. If you have ideas, find ways to experiment with them, prove them and take them further. Don\u2019t focus on theory, go forward and just DO. You will make mistakes, but this is the best way to achieve results and to learn. Learning from experience is the best way to move forward.

Take calculated risks to move yourself up.", "Don\u2019t focus on theory, go forward and just DO.", "The coolest thing is the immediacy of feedback from your customers either directly through your online store or on your other digital channels.

I love seeing customers say amazing things about our products.", "I think the single thing I wish that I understood better when I started was the inventory/cash flow relationship. My previous businesses didn\u2019t have inventory, which made it much easier to grow. In ecommerce, if you are growing at 300% per year like we are, there is never any cash to take out of the business or cash to pay taxes. In theory, there should be a big payday at the end of the rainbow, but it\u2019s been a stressful ride. My biggest piece of advice would be to understand this relationship between cash, inventory, and growth.", "The coolest thing about running our online store is knowing that we are helping so many people across the country. Rolling out our product into the hands of our first groups of consumers and hearing that they love our product and that they stick with it because it\u2019s better than what they had been using in the past is really motivating and exciting.", "The most important piece of advice for someone starting an ecommerce business is to be eager to learn as much as you can and remain aggressive in seeking out advice and help on topics in which you are not an expert, even if you\u2019re just looking for an outside opinion.

I wish I had been presented with a blueprint of all the roles that I would need within my online store to make it run smoothly without me spending hours upon hours trying to fulfill all of the tasks. In addition, I wish I knew how useful online freelancers could be for these tasks from the get go. My business partners and I performed a lot of the tasks on our own at first when we should have been passing it off to other ecommerce assistants.", "I sell, but I mostly enable others to sell.

Once you scale your ecommerce store, you literally make money when you sleep. Nothing beats the feeling of waking up to a slew of new sales.", "Once you scale your ecommerce store, you literally make money when you sleep.", "Before Bill Harding and I built Bonanza.com (an ecommerce marketplace), we had very little knowledge of how to best run an ecommerce business. But, as almost a decade has passed, and we have worked to refine the platform and amass sellers, the number one thing we\u2019ve noticed that our most profitable users provide is excellent customer service. Cultivating positive relationships with buyers is a great way to build a reputation and increase sales. We try to encourage it by providing great customer service for the platform, so sellers can carry over the positive experience to their buyers.", "Online retail is a combination of \u201chigh tech\u201d and \u201clow tech\u201d and to be successful you have to excel at both.

Often we see big brands that were once successful fail because the brand itself fails to evolve. Ecommerce businesses take a long time and trends will change, so your brand can\u2019t depend on a trend that may not be relevant in a few years.", "The most interesting thing about managing an online store is how even small changes\u2014like changing the page layout, cleaning up a section of code, or removing a step at check-out\u2014can have a big impact on the bottom line. That\u2019s been one of the most rewarding things for me: finding areas of inefficiencies that once solved can make a huge difference to both the customer journey and profit margins.", "At the very beginning is when it\u2019s easiest to establish a good foundation to build on. So, invest time, effort and resources in building out the right infrastructure for your ecommerce site. Don\u2019t let growth catch you off guard\u2014plan for it. Every piece of software and technology that gets put into place, like your backend ecommerce platform, should be easily scalable. Most importantly, security should be your number one concern from the get-go, because the stakes only get higher as your business grows. Take action, early and often, to prevent costly problems. When something does go wrong in ecommerce, even for a few minutes, it can cost you thousands of dollars.", "The coolest thing has\u00a0been setting the challenge to myself to take an idea and turn it into a profitable, fast-growing business, and then looking back over the last three years and seeing that I\u2019ve done just that. It\u2019s an awesome feeling!", "You need to learn how to acquire customers at a profitable cost. Sure, you need to do everything else too, like have great products and customer service, but it\u2019s all a bit of a waste of time unless you can also nail the customer acquisition part. The good news is, you can learn from, or hire some of the best in the world to help you with this.", "Being able to travel full time while managing the business is awesome, but meeting and connecting with customers and hearing their positive feedback will always make me smile, no matter how large we grow.", "For us, the most important factor has always been understanding the customer.

This eternal problem is what Jim Penman set out to solve when he started his part-time lawn-mowing business\u2014and even though his business has since grown into a multimillion-dollar enterprise known as Jim\u2019s Group, it\u2019s still the core focus.", "Jim\u2019s Group was an unintentional empire, started by an aspiring academic back in the 1980s. Today, Penman\u2019s company has almost 4,000 franchisees that provide over 50 services around the world. As a result, Jim\u2019s Group has become a household name in Australia for all things home services.", "Here\u2019s how Penman grew his business from a humble mowing service to the largest franchise in Australia.", "In the 1970s, Jim Penman was pursuing his Ph.D. in history at Latrobe University in hopes of joining academia. His plans changed, however, when he graduated in 1982 and realized he had little to no chance of working in academia: \u201cMy ideas were far too wild.\u201d", "At the time, Penman also happened to be operating a part-time lawnmowing business, as he made his way through the grueling grad school years. This turned into a full-time gig upon graduation. \u201cIt was something to do until my real business came along.\u201d", "Or so he thought. While he waited for his real life to kick in, Penman was excelling at his temporary one. He had a passion for making customers happy, which made it easy for him to attract and keep regular clients. \u201cIt was the biggest thing I had going for me,\u201d he says. He also found success building and selling ramps (for transporting mowing equipment onto raised beds or platforms) to his customers.", "As his business grew, he tried employing subcontractors, but he couldn\u2019t find people who matched his quality of service. Then in 1986, necessity forced him to evolve.", "Major competitor V.I.P. Home Services came to town. This was a turning point for Penman. \u201cI simply franchised in self-defense,\u201d he says. \u201cOtherwise, they\u2019d swallow me whole.\u201d", "For those unfamiliar, franchising allows other entities to use your company\u2019s name, trademark, business strategies, and so on in order to share essentially the same products and/or services offered by the franchisor. Franchisees typically pay a licensing fee and a percentage of sales revenue to their franchisors. It\u2019s an effective way to quickly expand a business without massive financial investment.", "Penman started with about a dozen franchisees, most of whom were previous customers. But even as Penman expanded his business, his focus still remained on the short term. He truly had no idea his business would grow to where it is today.", "\u201cWhen people asked me how I thought might go, I said, \u2018If it\u2019s really successful, one day I could have as many as 100 franchisees,\u2019\u201d Penman says, laughing. \u201cThat was my reach goal. Now, I have just under 4,000.\u201d", "When Penman was a contractor, he had one simple idea: He wanted to make customers into raving fans. \u201cI wanted customers to be so delighted that they\u2019d recommend me and use me forever.\u201d", "That was the core concept of Penman\u2019s business, and when he franchised, he had the same concept for his franchisees.", "With that in mind, he developed a contract that would catch the eye of any prospective franchisee. His goal was to make it so enticing that potential owners would be \u201cmad not to join the system.\u201d Penman even got ahold of a competitor\u2019s contract to better understand how he could make his more favorable.", "For example, he promised his franchisees that he wouldn\u2019t take regular clients from his franchisees without their consent (unless a customer complained). He promised territory rights\u2014meaning he couldn\u2019t give any client in their area to anyone else, but they could take work wherever they wanted. Penman also promised an automatic right to renew.", "\u201cThis was all really strange stuff,\u201d Penman says. \u201cOne reason it took nine months to get the contract done was because the lawyers kept arguing with me.\u201d", "They thought he was being way too nice and that the contract was unreasonable and extreme. They encouraged him to \u201csoften it down,\u201d but over time, he actually provided his franchisees more rights. These included the right to move to another regional franchisor, to walk away from the franchise for a small exit fee, and to vote out their franchisor.", "At every stage, Penman put his franchisees first. In his opinion, the secret to looking after your customers is having a great staff. The same thing applies to great franchisees\u2014you make them the actual first priority.", "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing particularly clever about what has done,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more how we do it that matters. The way we treat our franchisees, how we maintain quality, how we make sure they\u2019re looked after, that they\u2019re happy\u2026that\u2019s the innovative part of the system.\u201d", "As you can imagine, Penman\u2019s franchisee selection process is quite rigorous. With such a favorable franchising package, many people apply, but few are chosen.", "\u201cWe are very selective,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless I\u2019m convinced they\u2019ll succeed, I don\u2019t accept them.\u201d", "When interviewing franchisees, Penman looks for a handful of key attributes: Good character, a concern for customers, reliability, and basic decency. He takes each interviewee on test drives to watch them perform their service. He also never accepts anyone who is not putting up their investment money themselves.", "\u201cTo run a successful cleaning or mowing, you don\u2019t have to be a genius,\u201d Penman said. \u201cYou have to be somebody with good character.\u201d", "In the first few years of his business, Penman didn\u2019t just expand through franchising. He also began adding different service divisions.", "With a successful mowing system in place, Penman considered how he might apply his approach to other services, such as cleaning. He created a separate cleaning brand called SunLite and sold a couple of franchises. That avenue failed completely.", "Penman liked the idea of expanding under the Jim\u2019s Group name, but he didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be successful, because the brand image was so vastly different. Who\u2019d hire a cleaning service with a brand image of gardening and mowing?", "Well, a lot of people did. Penman added a cleaning division to Jim\u2019s Group and found that the familiar brand name actually helped grow his new business.", "Penman continued expanding under the Jim\u2019s Group brand to include services such as dog washing, computer services, bookkeeping, and roof repair. Today\u2019s Jim\u2019s Group has 52 divisions, and the company cross-sells through a client newsletter with about 500,000 recipients.", "\u201cThe brand just works far beyond what you think it would,\u201d Penman says.", "When asked about how he manages such a wide variety of services, he says, \u201cThere\u2019s no real difference between mowing and cleaning and dog washing. The basic issue is the same: Follow up on a lead, respond quickly, turn up on time, provide a reasonable quote, and satisfy the customer.\u201d", "To Penman, it doesn\u2019t matter what the service is. His goal is getting everyone to do provide consistent, high-quality service.", "Still, Penman is always making tweaks to Jim\u2019s Group to constantly improve that service. For example, Jim\u2019s initially offered a flat rate fee system to its franchisees. Over time, Penman learned that franchisees weren\u2019t always following up on leads. In fact, a survey found that 25 percent of client leads never received a follow up. Penman changed the fee system to reflect a lower base fee and a separate charge per lead. After that, the number of leads not being followed up on dropped to just 3 percent.", "Penman also made recent changes to the Jim\u2019s Group complaint system. In the pre-franchise days, Penman would see approximately 100 complaints for every 100 leads. After franchising, that number dropped to about five complaints.", "However, Penman wasn\u2019t satisfied with 5 percent. To fix the issue, he went to his regional franchisors, who manually receive these complaints. The team decided that every time a complaint comes in, the franchisor would alert Penman and the respective franchisee. Then, the franchisor would call the franchisee to better understand what happened and how to solve it.", "Today, Jim\u2019s Group has an automated complaint system. If a franchisee gets six complaints within six months, they receive a warning letter. Another six, and the franchisee has to attend retraining. They\u2019re now down to just 1 percent, and working to cut that at least in half.", "In a world full of new ideas, how does Penman stay focused on Jim\u2019s Group? \u201cYou might think we do 50 different things, but as a national franchisor, I do one thing: I provide a service. Jim\u2019s Group is a very focused and limited company.\u201d", "With almost 4,000 franchisees, it\u2019s even easier to provide global services. Today, the company also benefits from a much more sophisticated software and a wide variety of resources for franchisees.", "While Penman continues to expand Jim\u2019s Group, he never forgot his original passion: research. The only difference now is that he can afford to really pursue it.", "Until his academic career stalled, Penman never considered becoming wealthy. \u201cI\u2019ve never been that interested in money,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI\u2019m notoriously stingy. I go around the house and office turning lights off.\u201d", "But now he\u2019s able to use the success of his company as a vehicle for funding, so he can dedicate more time and resources into continuing his research on the epigenetics of social behavior. He believes this could help in the treatment of mental illness and addictive disorders.", "In Penman\u2019s opinion, many people have a misleading idea of business. They think they must have a breakthrough or a big idea to be successful.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not the brilliant ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s thousands of little ideas. Every day I say, \u2018How can I do this better?\u2019\u201d", "Penman encourages anyone who wants to grow to focus on yourself before considering franchising. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it well, there\u2019s no point in franchising, because you don\u2019t have anything to teach anyone else.\u201d", "He encourages entrepreneurs to build a brilliant business, then, master a working model that you constantly change to make better.", "Penman also believes in a people-first mindset, instead of money first. He encourages people to ask themselves: What\u2019s the long-term interest of the people I\u2019m dealing with? How can I make my customers and franchisees into raving fans?", "\u201cEvery day, I\u2019m asking myself the same question,\u201d Penman says.", "Finally, he recommends keeping in touch with the grassroots. Every single franchisee has Penman\u2019s personal number and email. \u201cI get multiple contacts a day,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m always listening to what\u2019s going on. I also read through most complaints.\u201d", "After all, it\u2019s the thousands of little things that count.", "Nathan: So the first question that I ask everyone is, how\u2019d you get your job?", "Jim: Not by intention. I went to university back in 1971 with the aim of working out why sterilisations rise and fall of all things. So I went and did a History Degree and then a PhD and my whole aim was to be an academic, and lawn mowing was my part time student job. And when I finished up in 1982 I realised that I had 0.0% chance of any kind of academic post, because my ideas were far too wild. So I decided to turn my part time mowing business into a full time job.", "Nathan: Yeah, wow. Incredible. And you know, if you fast forward to now, you know Jim\u2019s Group is, you know, the largest franchise in Australia purely by numbers-", "Jim: Not by turnover though, McDonald\u2019s and stuff do a bit better than us, by numbers-", "Nathan: But incredible feat. Like you know, the Jim\u2019s Group is, is an iconic brand. Like when Joel reached out to us to do this interview, I was really excited because you know, everyone knows the Jim\u2019s Group brand and you\u2019ve got over 50 different services that have been franchise.d So I\u2019m curious around anyone that\u2019s watching this, how did it all start? Like what you started, you started doing the lawn mowing. What, what happened next?", "Jim: Well, none of this was intentional. This was, when I started mowing full time, I had no idea this was going to be anything particular. This was sort of some something to do until you know my real business came along.", "Nathan: Yes.", "Jim: And I started off by, well I was mowing lawns and I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, but I had a big passion for customers. That was the biggest thing I had going for me. So I used to find it very easy to pick up and keep regular clients. And I figured out after a while that it was more money in building up and selling lawn mowing rounds, than there was in doing anything else. I had tried employing subcontractors and difficult to get the quality right and so forth. So I started building up and selling lawn mowing rounds. And, again that was a short term thing, no long term intentions. And about 19, when was, 1986 I made your competitor a franchise lawn mowing business came to Melbourne. That was VIP.", "Nathan: Yes.", "Jim: And to a large extent I simply franchised in self-defence, otherwise I thought they\u2019d swallow me whole.", "Nathan: Ah interesting. And you know what happened next? You decided to franchise, was it easy to find other franchisees or-", "Jim: Well I\u2019d been selling lawn mowing rounds for quite some time, so I had a lot of people who I knew.", "Nathan: Yes.", "Jim: So when I actually launched, my first franchisees were people who bought lawn mowing rounds off me in the past, that I knew they were good, some of the good ones.", "Nathan: Yes.", "Jim: And I\u2019ve been in contact with them, and some of my best subcontractors. So I had about a dozen to start with and then I started going from there. And honestly I didn\u2019t really understand what this thing was. When somebody asked me at that time, how do you think it might go? And I said, \u201cIf it\u2019s really successful it really works well, one day I could have as many as 100 franchisees.\u201d That was my reach goal.", "Nathan: Yeah, there you go. And you\u2019ve got I think 5000?", "Jim: Just under 4000 yeah.", "Nathan: Okay, just under 4000 okay, interesting. And when it comes to, I guess anyone that is watching this and they might have a service based business that they\u2019re looking to franchise, they have something that is unique enough in the marketplace that they think that they would like to license their brand and turn it into a franchise. What is your recommendations there? Where to get started?", "Jim: Well, first of all there\u2019s nothing particularly or unique about what we\u2019ve done. Our services are mowing, gardening, cleaning, dog washing, very basic thing. There\u2019s nothing particularly clever about what we do. It\u2019s more, how we do it that matters. It\u2019s the way we treat our franchisees, how we maintain quality, how we make sure that they\u2019re looked after, that they\u2019re happy. That\u2019s the innovative part of the system.", "Nathan: Interesting. And talk to me like around that system ,for your first five franchisees, what did that system look like? You know, because I think that\u2019s one thing that is very inherent of some of the best businesses out there, they have incredible systems, operational processes. You guys are obviously a master, like masters of this and and being able to basically put your, like your business in a box with a nicely tied bow. Can you talk to us around that?", "Jim: Okay. In the beginning, our systems weren\u2019t particularly strong, what we do now is many, many times more sophisticated and complex than what we used to do in the beginning. I had really one simple idea, when I was a mowing contractor, my fundamental idea was, I was going to make my customers into raving fans. I wanted my customers to be so delighted, they\u2019d use me forever. They recommend me to their friends. They pick up their neighbours. So that was the concept of my gardening business. When I wanted to franchise, I had the same concept with franchisees. My whole idea was to turn my franchisees into raving fans. So what I did was develop a contract that I thought was the most favourable that it possibly could be to any prospective franchisee.", "I wanted a contracts so good, you\u2019d have to be mad not to join the system. I got hold of the contract from my competitor. I look at it, I said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not fair, that\u2019s not right.\u201d So I put a whole lot of clauses in giving my franchisees protection. For example, I told them I will not take regular clients off you without your consent, unless the customer complaints. I will give you territory rights. You get right a first refusal, for any client in your area, in your territory, I can\u2019t give it to anybody else, but you can take work wherever you wish. You can build your business to whatever size you wish. When you come to renew, you got an automatic right to renew.", "Now, this was all really strange stuff and actually one of the reasons it took me nine months to get my contracts done is because the lawyers kept on arguing with me. They kept on saying, you\u2019re being too nice. Why you giving all this stuff to your franchisees? And what they essentially said to me is that this is so unreasonable, this is so extreme. You\u2019re going to have to soften it down. But actually what happened is as time went by, I actually gave my franchisees more rights. For example, I gave them the right to move to a different franchisor if they weren\u2019t happy.", "Nathan: Yes.", "Jim: Basically to walk away from the business if they weren\u2019t happy, most pay a few thousand dollars-", "Nathan: And no exit fees?", "Jim: No exit fees, well very small, $4000, which we don\u2019t normally charge and most radical of all the right to vote out their franchisor, which is completely unprecedented in the world. So we\u2019ve done all this really radical stuff. And strange thing is what it means is that at every stage of the business, you\u2019ve got to look after your franchisees.", "Nathan: Yeah. So when it comes to that, what was the outcome? Was the outcome because of these, you know, things that you\u2019re doing for your franchisees that the was always really happy and they\u2019re always happy to come back, or-", "Jim: The secret of looking after customers is to have good people. Like if you want to look after your customers in any business, you\u2019ve got to have great staff. You\u2019ve going to have staff who believe in what you\u2019re doing. Well, the same thing with franchising, if you want to look after your customers well, you\u2019ve got to have great franchisees. Which means our actual first priority in Jim\u2019s is not clients, it\u2019s franchisees. We say our first priority is the welfare of our franchisees.", "Nathan: And what do you look for in a franchisee? Do you have a rule book?", "Jim: Well, first of all, one of the unusual things we do, which is not common in franchising, service franchising in Australia, is we are very carefully selective. In fact, when I talk to franchisor, my first hour and a half is talking about why it\u2019s so crucial to be selective and to knock back people that you\u2019re not \u2026 unless you\u2019re convinced they\u2019ll succeed, you should not accept them. And then we go to how we select. Now in reality, to run a successful cleaning or a mowing business, you don\u2019t have to be some, you know, all time genius entrepreneur.", "You basically need to have a good character, be able to follow the system, have a concern for customers. Just be decent sort of person, fairly steady, that kind of thing, but we would look for things like, first of all, we take them out on the road. That\u2019s the best test of all. We look at how they do it. Do they follow instructions? Can they \u2026 like if you\u2019re mowing the lawn for example, you don\u2019t just go around in circles. You go around the edge and then you go up and down straight lines. Now if you tell a prospect that a couple of times, if they\u2019re not doing it by the end of the day, you fell them.", "Nathan: Yeah.", "Jim: You\u2019ve got to move the hose, you coil the hose in the garden. Don\u2019t just mow past it. If they\u2019re not doing that, then you fell them. If they don\u2019t turn up on time or if they come in late and they don\u2019t apologise, you fell them. So you look at that sort of thing. As far as the interview is concerned, we\u2019ll look for a supportive partner. Very important.", "Nathan: Ah, spousal buy-in, very smart.", "Jim: We would not normally except somebody who hasn\u2019t got a partner in support. We would not accept somebody who\u2019s not putting up the money themselves, like it\u2019s a father\u2019s putting up their money, that\u2019s an almost certain failure. We look for somebody who asks good questions. See we\u2019re not asking for somebody who could run a McDonald\u2019s outlet, that\u2019s a different level of business.", "Nathan: Yes.", "Jim: But just somebody with good character. And most of our franchisees, would tend to be from sort of the middle to the upper end of the employment market. So it\u2019s not that hard. You just got to recognise the ones that really won\u2019t fit.", "Nathan: I see. And at what point did you start to move into different verticals?", "Jim: Different divisions?", "Nathan: Yeah sorry you call it-", "Jim: We call it divisions-", "Nathan: Okay, sorry.", "Jim: Well I guess it sort of explains the, you know, I\u2019m gonna ruin people\u2019s idea that I\u2019m some genius entrepreneur because that was, that was almost by default. What actually happened was when I had this system set up for mowing, my thought was, okay, well I\u2019ve got these contracts, and this system, and it\u2019s ways of delivering work and so forth. So why not apply it to cleaning? But obviously, this is a garden, looks like a gardener. That\u2019s what it looked like. That\u2019s me actually. That\u2019s a picture of me.", "Nathan: Yeah.", "Jim: All right. So obviously that wouldn\u2019t work for cleaning clearly. So what I did was I set up this other brand called Sunlit, little sprays and things that look like cleaning. Sold a couple of franchises. Failed completely, couldn\u2019t make it work. All right. Somebody came to me and they said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019d like to do Jim\u2019s Cleaning.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t want to do that\u201d, because it\u2019s a gardening image. And they said, \u201cIt\u2019ll work.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, it will not work. It\u2019s a gardening image you couldn\u2019t possibly work for cleaning.\u201d And they say, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll give it a go. We\u2019ll do it.\u201d So I said, \u201cAll right, well if you do it and you take the risk on it, well have a go.\u201d And it works. So I was wrong.", "So \u2026 and people would look at the, the somebody would come in to talk to a real estate agent and say, \u201cI\u2019m from Jim\u2019s Cleaning.\u201d And they\u2019d say, \u201cOh yeah. Oh, Jim like the \u2026 Oh, okay. All right.\u201d So you can see the reaction, somehow the brand crossed itself, and that applies to anything. It\u2019s funny that this gardening image actually seems to work for, you know, women who turn up to wash your dogs, or bookkeepers or computer. The brand just works far beyond what you think it would.", "Nathan: Yeah. No, it\u2019s interesting. So at what point in time, how long did it take before you launched your first division? After Jim\u2019s Mowing?", "Jim: Would have been a couple of years.", "Nathan: Oh really? Okay.", "Jim: Two or three years. I\u2019m not sure exactly, about 1992 I think about, sorry. Yeah, about that.", "Nathan: Yeah. And was it hard to maintain the consistency across all the different divisions as it grew, around, I guess, keeping the customer happy and the quality of the product or the service?", "Jim: The point is, there\u2019s no real difference for being mowing and cleaning and dog washing, and computer services and and antennas and book \u2026 There\u2019s no difference at all.", "Nathan: Yes.", "Jim: The basic issue is the same. You\u2019ve got to, what we do is we make it a lead through is actually allocated by the computer because the computer, the system knows who needs work and where. So we\u2019ll know that there\u2019s four people taking a job in Doncaster and we will pick one of those if it\u2019s a territory holder first and others. So that\u2019s all the same. So what you\u2019ve got to do for a franchisee, you\u2019ve got to follow up that lead, you\u2019ve got to find the client back quickly. Every minute that passes by delays, it makes it less chance you\u2019re going to get the job. So follow up quickly. You ring them back. If you can\u2019t get through, you\u2019ve got to send a text, these days with mobile phones. You got to turn up when you say you will, give a couple of hours leeway, then you\u2019ve got to give a quote, a written quote, then you\u2019ve got to satisfy the customer.", "So it\u2019s pretty, it\u2019s pretty simple. It doesn\u2019t really matter what the service is, the basic problem is getting people to do all that consistently. And obviously in the start we were better than we had been, because we had systems of \u2026 like I introduce systems, like for example, one thing I found was that people weren\u2019t always following up leads. So we used to have in a sense a flat rate fee system in the beginning. And we found that people were just ignoring leads. They would get so busy that they would say, \u201cOh I won\u2019t bother with that.\u201d So what we did actually change the system of charging for jobs.", "So instead of having a flat rate fee, which is what most of our competitors still do, we have a lower base fee and we charge for every lead, whether they get it or not. And we did a little survey, we had some people on flat rate fees and some on these new fangled lead fee ideas. And we\u2019ve found that when there was a no lead fee, a quarter of the clients we rang hadn\u2019t been followed up. When there was a lead fee, 3%.", "Nathan: Yeah. I See.", "Jim: And what we actually found, when you looked at the conversion of the lead to the job, for the \u2026 when there was a lead fee, we\u2019re converting about three out of four, which is about what we do.", "Nathan: Yes.", "Jim: But for the flat fee it was less than half. So we were getting one eighth as many customers unhappy and 50% more actual jobs from the same volume of leads, simply by changing the way we were charged fees.", "Nathan: Yeah, interesting. So still quite data driven.", "Jim: Very, very data driven. And what we then started to do was to look at ways of going beyond that. So for example, one thing we look at in Jim\u2019s is complaint rate. That\u2019s the number of clients that complain. Now in a pre franchise days, I can remember looking, when my had subcontractors, they weren\u2019t very good. Okay. Other than for every hundred leads we get approximately 100 complaints. Now when we put the franchise system in place, we obviously selected a lot more carefully and we were, you know, we were talking to them about things and we were training them and doing all kinds of things to improve this. And then there was the lead fee system, we found that it actually dropped quite quite well. We were down to 5%, so for every hundred leads, five complaints.", "But I said that\u2019s not good enough. That\u2019s not good enough. And I actually noticed it too because the complaint rate wasn\u2019t showing that, but I was taking a lot of calls in the office and I noticed that I was taking more complaints than anyone else. They weren\u2019t recording the complaints strictly enough. So I got all the staff to do that, and then I discovered this 5% figure, and I said, \u201cThis is not good, this is still too high.\u201d So then we started putting systems into place and the first thing after talking with my franchisor, because Jim\u2019s has got regional franchisors to look after franchisees. I went to them and said, okay this \u2026 actually it was their suggestion. Every time a complaint comes in, we\u2019re going to send not just to the franchisee, but to you as the franchisor, your job is to ring the franchisee and see what happened.", "And then that then generates a conversation and the franchisee gets into problems. And that improved things a bit. Then we started recording complaints, and we started the system, which is now heavily automated, where if they get a certain number of complaints, which is six complaints within six months, that at least 6% of leads, they get a warning letter. And then if it happens again in the next six months, they get a breach notice, and they have to attend retraining, and then every complaint gets sent to me. So you put into place and they continue to get complaints, they get terminated.", "Nathan: So similar like how Uber, how they score.", "Jim: Yes, very much so. And and just a few years ago, we also started doing customer surveys, which is automated mainly by SMS. And about 30% of our customers respond. And then we record that as well. Now the actual level of complaints now is it just a fraction under 1%. So in other words about a 99% improvement in complaints, and we are putting some stuff together at the moment to do with IT. I am convinced we can drop that at the very least in half, we can improve what we do.", "Nathan: Interesting. So when you decided to launch the other divisions, did you do much cross selling, because you know that would raise overall, even though this is a franchise and you\u2019ve got many franchisors and franchisees, it would raise your LTV of lifetime value of a customer. Did you do any, like do you do right now, or did you back then a lot of different cross selling and-", "Jim: Well the question is how you can cross sell, because bear in mind the person who comes out to clean your house is a cleaning franchisee. These people aren\u2019t high level entrepreneurs. They\u2019re good people, they\u2019re sensible enough in business, but they\u2019re the kind of people that probably wouldn\u2019t naturally run a business successfully themselves. I mean, there\u2019s some interesting stats on businesses. I just looked up there\u2019s a, it\u2019s a organisation in America called the International Janitorial and Cleaning Services Association.", "Nathan: Yes.", "Jim: And their estimate is that 95% of people fail in a cleaning business in their first year.", "Nathan: Wow.", "Jim: With us, the relevant figure is around 11%. So these are people on the whole who probably wouldn\u2019t be successful in business without our help, but because of the training, because of the leads we give them, because of the ongoing support, and the meetings and everything else, they tend to be successful.", "So it\u2019s, I guess it\u2019s a long way of saying is the people that, most of the people who do, some of them are absolutely brilliant. There\u2019s no question. Some are natural entrepreneurs, most of them aren\u2019t particularly sophisticated. So they\u2019re not going to, a person who comes to clean your house is not going to upsell to the mowing or the dog wash, or the antennas on the whole. Sometimes they\u2019ll establish relationship with somebody that they know, in another division, but usually they don\u2019t cross sale. The only way we really cross sell is we have a client newsletter which goes to about half a million Australian households every month, and that just soft sell, promotes the different divisions.", "Nathan: Got you. I\u2019m interested around your thought process or what your thoughts are around the concept of focus. You know, a lot of entrepreneurs, they have what is called Shiny Object Syndrome. You know, you\u2019ve built an incredible brand and often when you do build a great brand, it\u2019s only natural that you want to, you know, bolt on another product or service, and sometimes you can find yourself having so many different products or services and you forget what the core is and it\u2019s so difficult to be good at so many different things. You know, you guys have over 50 different divisions, 50 different services, 50 different franchisors, thousands of franchisees. Like what is your thoughts on that, on that idea?", "Jim: Well, it\u2019s kind of misleading in a way, because you think that we do 52 different things, but we don\u2019t actually as a National Franchisor, I do one thing. A client rings up, they want a service done, we want to provide that service. Essentially, it doesn\u2019t make any difference what it is. It\u2019s actually, the more people you have, the easier it is. See, for example now that we\u2019ve got nearly 4000 franchisees, we\u2019ve got much, much more sophisticated IT systems. All the systems I\u2019m talking you about, about complaints and surveys and all this kind of stuff, is possible because of our sheer size.", "We can have a training course for franchisors which we run every six weeks, where we train our franchisors how to be leaders. We have all kinds of resources. We actually are very focused, limited company. We don\u2019t do a lot of stuff, and the times when we\u2019ve tried two different things or a good example is we\u2019ve set up a factory to make trailers for our dog wash division, quite frankly it was a disaster. It lost money for about two years, and it had problems with quality and all kinds of things. And eventually I handed over to my wife who\u2019s a builder. And, and she now handles it very efficiently. You see, we\u2019re not very good at doing things that are out of our core mission area.", "So I guess the answer to that is we really focus very, very hard from the beginning. We don\u2019t get involved in site-based franchise. We tried it once with health clubs. Never again, we don\u2019t understand that. We don\u2019t understand manufacturing. We don\u2019t understand anything else apart from what we do. So we are an extremely focused business.", "Nathan: Interesting. That\u2019s great to here. So talk to me around, you know, one thing I found interesting is, with Jim\u2019s, you actually use this as a vehicle. You know, the profits that are generated from this business, to put back into your real passion projects. I\u2019d love to hear about that because a lot of people would find this interesting. You\u2019re using Jim\u2019s as a real vehicle to fund other business activities. You know, whether, yeah. So just I\u2019d love to hear.", "Jim: Well until my academic career failed. I never for one minute ever thought of becoming wealthy. I never had any interest in money. I\u2019ve always been simply, I\u2019m notoriously stingy and I go around the house, turn the lights off in this kind of thing and the office too. So I\u2019ve never had an interest in money as such. But as soon as this happened, I knew I needed a lot of money. The point about my research is this, I started off trying to understand how civilizations rise and fall. Why they do? That was my key question, you know, why did the Roman Empire collapse? Could it happen to us? What was going on? And what I determined was that the key was character, was personality, wasn\u2019t some vast, impersonal, economical or political force. People changed. And what I realised after a while, and I started looking at cross cultural anthropology and zoology and biology, was that this, these changes in character had a biological basis.", "So I started off doing a PhD in History, and then ended up with something that really needed to be tested in the lab, with \u2026 basically with chemicals and rats and this kind of thing like that. So it\u2019s a totally different fields. So what actually happened, and that was my dream. And while I was doing this and building my business and often very busy, I would get up at like five o\u2019clock in the morning and I would be writing and working on this. So I\u2019d take a day off and go down to Monash library and research on primates and this kind of thing. So I was always interested in that. And about 10 years ago, I had enough money, at last, and then I just went round and I approached a academic at La Trobe University, and I said to him I want to fund some research, basically into rats, and what I want to do essentially is to mildly limit the food intake and look at the changes in behaviour.", "And what we\u2019ve found over the years is some dramatic changes in behaviour that can result. And we\u2019ve worked out ways of actually changing that. And even though, as I said, the original research was all about civilizations, what it actually in practise means, is that we can look at ways of curing people from things like addiction and mental illness and so forth, and this some very, very promising stuff. We\u2019ve got pheromones, for example, we\u2019re using pheromones with dramatic effect. We can actually improve maternal behaviour, make rats more hardworking, more exploratory.", "And we\u2019re also looking at the epigenetics, which wasn\u2019t around back in the 70s when I did my PhD, but we looked at the epigenetic changes then we\u2019re looking at using CRISPR to try and duplicate those. So essentially it\u2019s something that could, it could change human history in a quite radical way. It could be the fundamental answer to things like mental illness and even poverty for example. Ways of helping people to live better and more productive lives", "Nathan: Yeah. Well that\u2019s fascinating. So if this is such a passion project, why do you not get a CEO in the business and then you can go full time on, on your research?", "Jim: Well, I\u2019m not a researcher, I\u2019m actually at this present time, we\u2019re just starting to look for someone to head the research full time. Somebody with a background in epigenetics, somebody who understands CRISPR and so forth. But really it\u2019s not my field. I\u2019m not a biological scientist, I don\u2019t have an area like that. I know what needs to be done. I would tell Professor Paolini, who\u2019s running the experiments, I want you to, you know, do this, I want you to take the bedding from the rats that are then put the other rats and do this, and he\u2019d sort of do this stuff and go, \u201cOh Wow, this stuff works. This is amazing.\u201d So at that level, I can do it. But in terms of actually running the research, it\u2019s not my skill. And I don\u2019t know if I have any particular skills, but if I have any abilities it\u2019s probably better directed towards running Jim\u2019s Group and trying to make that more and more profitable. Which it is, of course.", "Nathan: Yeah. Interesting. So look, we have to work towards wrapping up. I\u2019m curious around what kind of advice would you give to somebody that has a service based business and they\u2019re looking to franchise perhaps, and it\u2019s still early days for them. What would you say if you wanted to \u2026 if you know someone\u2019s watching this and they want to get into, you know that\u2019s a way to to scale to grow.", "Jim: People have a very wrong, false idea about what business is about. There\u2019s all this idea you\u2019re going to have some brain wave, some idea, some breakthrough like the Zuckerberg things, setting up Facebook, this kind of stuff.", "Nathan: Yeah.", "Jim: To me, that is quite misleading. When I look at my career starting out from a part time gardening business, and I originally used to charge a $1.50 an hour to do gardening, I\u2019ve gone \u2026 and it\u2019s continuously from there to here. It\u2019s not brilliant ideas. It\u2019s thousands and thousands and thousands of little ideas. Every day of my working life I\u2019d say, \u201cHow can I do this better?\u201d And I would say to anybody who wants to grow their business, franchising is just part of the process. To get to where you can franchise, you\u2019ve got to have a great business model, because if you don\u2019t do it well, there\u2019s no point in franchising because you haven\u2019t got anybody to teach anybody else.", "The first thing if we look for a franchisor is, how much money they\u2019re making, have they got great customer service. Do they like helping people? So you\u2019ve got to have a great person. So if you\u2019re looking at franchising, first of all, you\u2019ve got to have a brilliant business. Then you\u2019re going to set up a model and then you\u2019ve got to constantly change it and change it and change it and change it to make it better. Particularly, I believe for franchisees, and I\u2019m a great believer in franchisee focused businesses. I think if you look at the money first, in any sense, whether you\u2019re talking about clients, or whether you\u2019re talking about franchisees, you come completely unstuck. You\u2019ve always got to make the decision to say what\u2019s the longterm interests, to people I\u2019m dealing with?", "How can I make my customers into raving fans? How can I make my franchisees into raving fans? And if you do that, you just get quite unexpected results. But every day of my life, every day I\u2019m asking myself the same question, and also I would say to anybody who wants to be in franchising is keep in touch with your grassroots. Now every, we\u2019ve got nearly 4000 franchisees, every single one of them has my direct mobile number and my email address and they contact often. I get multiple contacts a day from franchisees. All kinds of reasons about complaints, about advice, about problems with their franchisor, all kinds of things. Everybody can reach me really simply. So I\u2019m always listening to what\u2019s going on.", "Nathan: I love it. Couple of last questions. I have to ask you about brand building, cause you know Jim\u2019s is an iconic brand in Australia. Everyone knows it. How\u2019d you do that?", "Jim: Well, once again, no great foresight. I know people can spend millions of dollars searching brands. The way it happened with me is that when I used to do leaflets and when I was, Jim\u2019s Mowing was Jim mowing, I used to find if I put my photo on the leaflet, it actually got a better response. So when we franchised, well you can\u2019t put a photo on a uniform. So I got a graphic artist to do up a design of my face. Okay. And we actually, the hardest part was working out the right littering. We use the Jim, which is a particular kind of type. And it was put up around the office to see which was the most, I asked the girls to look at it, which is the most easy to recognise and the quickest to read.", "And look, I suppose, you know, we might\u2019ve spent 50 or 60 bucks developing the logos. And later on some of my managers said we need to update the photo a bit. So they got in one recent photo of me actually one smiling, which is pretty hard to do and they changed it, but essentially very, very little thought we into it. I think it was focused too much on the brand. It\u2019s the service that counts. Are you looking after your customers well? Are you looking after your franchisees well? And if you do that, the brand will stand for quality.", "Nathan: Yeah. Amazing. Look, last question. Where\u2019s the best place people can find out more about yourself and your work. I know you\u2019re actually just about to release a new book. Would love to hear about where people can find out more in a little bit about the book and yeah?", "Jim: Well a recent biography has just been launched. If anybody wants to find out all about myself and Jim\u2019s, www.jims.net. And if anybody wants to email me, I\u2019m very easy to contact. Just email ", "[email\u00a0protected]", " I\u2019m also very open to the public people. People write to me at all kinds of things.

Over the years, however, he found that there was no single outlet that satisfied his cravings to learn about the very latest products and developments.", "Sure, he avidly scrolled tech Twitter and Reddit threads. But what if, he wondered, there was some kind of a reliable destination where those in the tech field, or otherwise infatuated with its latest offerings, could show up regularly to talk shop\u2014to share and learn about all the latest and greatest in tech?", "\u201cThe initial inspiration was just the desire to explore new technology,\u201d Hoover says.", "So began a side project that, in just over five years, has become the wildly popular hub for the tech community, Product Hunt. In 2018, more than 1 million registered users and many more unregistered visitors stopped by Hoover\u2019s creation, and over 20,000 products launched on the site. More than just a news site or message board, Product Hunt has evolved into the definitive place for makers to introduce their new projects and learn about what their peers are up to.", "But this great, big community all began with a simple email list.", "Hoover had been working in a product management position at growing startup PlayHaven, where he was employee #10. He values his time spent at the company, especially lessons learned about management. But at the time, he had only been out of college a couple of years, and was eager to try hs hand at something new, so Hoover moved into a part-time role to explore new projects.", "Going part-time gave him the space in his schedule that he needed to pursue something of his own. He\u2019d been mulling over the idea of Product Hunt, and the time had finally come to make it a reality.", "It began as a simple email newsletter between friends sharing the latest tech product releases and mind-blowing apps they stumbled across. But soon, friends of friends and friends twice removed were added to the list.", "Before long, Hoover was managing an email list that included far more strangers than friends from all around the globe. He decided to bring his friend Nathan Bashaw on board to build a website, giving Product Hunt a home online, and the community continued to flourish.", "\u201cWe sort of filled this hole I think, in the market that no one really observed or noticed,\u201d he says. \u201cWe do have Twitter, and we have subreddits around technology, and we have blogs and publications talking about new tech, but there is really no home for the tech community to talk about the latest products.\u201d", "With a brand new website, Hoover planned to turn it into that home.", "But in order to host meaningful conversation, he knew he had to engage users with something other social platforms weren\u2019t offering. Hoover says he intentionally focused on positive community building from day one by sending personalized welcome emails to each new user who joined Product Hunt.", "\u201cAs proud as I am of what we\u2019ve built on the product and technical side, that\u2019s not what\u2019s going to make us successful or make us special and unique,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really the people and the brand that we\u2019ve built.\u201d", "But the site membership ballooned rapidly, not only exceeding his ability to email each new visitor, but also evolving into much more than just a side project or an email list.", "Product Hunt grew to fill an important hole, helping entrepreneurs face a daunting task that so many in the tech space must take on at some point: product launch.", "Hoover noticed that traditional media outlets were the primary way that creators would get the word out about new products, but even tech publications weren\u2019t particularly suited to support a launch.

Everything from, as a kid, managing my parent\u2019s gumball machine at their video game store to basically pushing carts at a home improvement store and kind of fast forward to where I am now, I started Product Hunt about just over five years ago now and I guess how I got my job is it started off as a side project and eventually that side project turned into something more serious, a business. And so now it\u2019s today, fast forward five years since Product Hunt started, still leading the team and my day to day is still very much focused on growing the community and exploring new products and technology every day.", "Nathan: Yeah, amazing. So I was following kind of the early stage Product Hunt journey when it was first launched and I remember in the early days you could, and still right now, you could get a lot of traction if you post your latest product or a new feature that you\u2019ve added to your app or any new product and, yeah, you guys have a massive community but it was, still is, a very, very powerful place to really get press and really get awareness for whatever you\u2019re launching. So I guess how did you come up with the idea in the early days?", "Ryan: Yeah, well initially it was I\u2019ve always kind of loved technology and been very curious I guess around technology. And playing with different apps and products over the years. And I sort of realised after playing with products and talking about them with my friends constantly, I realised why isn\u2019t there just a simple list on the internet where it lists here are the new, cool products that launched today? And I very much built it, it\u2019s almost a clich\u00e9, I built the project for myself initially. It was just me and my friends wanted a place to share these things and that kind of grew into a community from there. But the initial inspiration was just the desire to explore new technology. And fast forward, initially it was just to share things we discovered, but quickly it also became a launch pad for makers and founders and start ups and the kind of realisation is that historically, to get your first users, to get your word out, a lot of people would go to the press to do so. They would have to have a relationship in many ways or get lucky cold emailing reporters and hoping that they\u2019d get someone to write about their company. And that was sort of the way that people launched. And it still is today to some extent.", "But the reality is most people don\u2019t have those connections, they don\u2019t have those relationships. They oftentimes just don\u2019t want to go through all the hassle of pitching their story to a bunch of different people. And the reality is the press and publications weren\u2019t really built for launching. They\u2019re not designed to support launching, they\u2019re designed to tell stories and break news. And so there\u2019s sort of misalignment of getting goals that Product Hunt sort of fills in many ways in terms of Product Hunt is the place to launch your product and a place that people go to discover new products and new start ups.", "So anyway, my kind of interest in this space kind of started very early on in my childhood and eventually I kind of stumbled into what it now kind of became.", "Nathan: Yeah. And you didn\u2019t start Product Hunt as a start up per se, it was just a passion project, side project, that kind of took off, right?", "Ryan: Yeah. Yeah, it was actually an email list too. So it wasn\u2019t even, it was a side project but it wasn\u2019t even a website or anything advanced in the beginning.", "Nathan: Yeah. And what were you doing at the time before you launched it all or just working on it?", "Ryan: Yeah, initially it was, so it was actually when I was in between jobs. So I\u2019d been in a previous start up for about three years and I joined as employee number 10 and we had ups and downs and I eventually left as the company recruited 100 people. But I really wanted to challenge myself and explore some new career challenges. And so I ended up actually leaving the company and went to a part time role. And what was nice is during that time as I was sort of making a little bit of money as a part time employee, I was able to experiment with different ideas. And so that gave me the time to explore and it was during that time that Product Hunt started. So my previous history was in product management and in building products and working with teams. So a lot of that experience in product management really helped me in my path towards ultimately becoming a CEO and building a product myself.", "Nathan: Yeah. Makes sense. So talk me through the early days of Product Hunt. What was it like? Because this is your first start up, home run, acquired by AngelList, yeah, this is a very large, well-known site. Talk me through that.", "Ryan: Yeah. I think, well most founders, you know, you end up doing a lot of things for the first time when you\u2019re starting a company. Everything from building the product to hiring to raising capital to firing. All the good and all the bad that comes with building a company. And so I think in the beginning a lot of it\u2019s \u2026 first you really, just be excited about what you\u2019re building. And I know that\u2019s kind of an obvious thing to say, but you need to be so excited about what you\u2019re building because it\u2019s going to be really hard at some points and if you\u2019re not motivated and excited to pursue your mission or build the product that you want to see in the world it\u2019s going to be just hard to push through some of those challenges. So in the early days it was initially an email list and then my buddy Nathan came on board to help build out the website and this was before we incorporated the company, it wasn\u2019t, it was still a side project and then to sort of fast forward we ended up eventually figuring out, okay, well what are we going to do with this thing?", "It was growing very quickly, there were some clear signs of opportunity there and what I realised is we needed to figure out what is the next steps, what is this side project going to become? And I ended up applying to YCombinator, getting in and kind of building the initial founding team from there. And a lot of the last years or so are really very much a blur in some ways. Both great things, both hard things and challenges, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.", "Nathan: Yeah. Amazing. And talk to me around the early stages. How did you, you said in the early days of Product Hunt you seeded the community, it was just your friends and you wanted to share cool products, how did you further on foster that community? Because I think that\u2019s been a really integral part of why Product Hunt is an amazing place to go and learn about new products, but then also as a launchpad because it has such a cultivated, incredible community of people and, yeah.", "Ryan: You know in the beginning we knew that community was really the core and it still is today, of Product Hunt. The technical side is \u2026of kind of what we built on the product and technical side, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s going to make us successful or make us special and unique. It\u2019s really the people and the brand that we built. And so in the very beginning that was a very clear focus. And while Product Hunt started with just me and my friend, quickly it grew beyond that. Very, very quickly. And it became friends of friends and it became, you know, people around the world that I have several degrees of separation from. But to build that kind of initial base, a lot of it was tactical things like seeing who was signing up in the very early days and emailing people who signed up personally with my Gmail address to welcome them and just really create an impression. My goal was to create an impression and hopefully remain memorable and get them curious and excited to contribute and be a part of the community. So there are things like that that were really important.", "There\u2019s also really subtle details too about the brand that we built. We have, our mascot is a cat wearing Google Glass which is kind of silly and ridiculous and increasingly nostalgic, perhaps, as Google Glass certainly isn\u2019t the most innovative tech product in the world. It\u2019s very much intentional that it\u2019s a cat too. It\u2019s supposed to be playful, it\u2019s supposed to inspire some curiosity and it\u2019s supposed to make people ask questions and set a tone of friendliness. And so things like that in the product, in the brand, have been really important in kind of establishing the tone and the vibe and making it a place that people want to hang out and explore and be a part of.", "Nathan: That\u2019s interesting. So in the early days, how many people do you reckon you reached out to personally from your personal Gmail and, yeah, just that whole doing things that don\u2019t scale. How long were you doing that? Because, yeah, Product Hunt grew very, very fast.", "Ryan: Yeah. I should look back in my email logs because it\u2019s there. I don\u2019t know how many people I emailed, definitely hundreds over the course of the early weeks or so. And I might have emailed 20 or 30 people personally every single day. And I think that, well I know that that helps. In fact I\u2019ve even had people years later remind me about the emails they received from me, because they remember it years later. It was kind of unusual. You don\u2019t really get, you never get emails that are truly personalised, that are truly from the founder or the creator of a product when you sign up. You might get those automated emails that are pretending to be personal and we all know they\u2019re not, but you don\u2019t get real, personal emails where \u2026 I made it very clear that it was personal because it mentioned their name and their company and something about them that it not something that can be automated. And yeah, it was certainly not scalable and I don\u2019t do it anymore. I don\u2019t look and see who\u2019s signing up and email them personally. Maybe I should to some extent, but it\u2019s just not scalable and at our numbers now we\u2019re just trying to do things that can attract another million people to visit the site this month, not another couple of thousand.", "Nathan: So talk to me around the traction and where you guys are at now, just so our audience can get \u2026 with Product Hunt, how far have you taken this company?", "Ryan: Yeah, so we, in the beginning it was \u2026 what we quickly realised and frankly day zero I couldn\u2019t have foreseen is that we sort of filled this hole, I think, in the market that no-one really observed or noticed, perhaps. And that we do have Twitter and we have subreddits around technology and we have blogs and publications talking about new tech, but there is really no home for the tech community to talk about the latest products and the newest technology and sort of a community to sort of geek out about that stuff. And one of the reason why we saw the quick traction at the beginning is because it very much filled a hole in the market, to some extent, that people just didn\u2019t see. And that led to just a swarm of people contributing and being a part of the community early on.", "And as we kind of fast forward, we now grow in different ways. So in the beginning a lot of it was through word of mouth and to some extent and also press in the beginning was helpful to get our first few thousand kind of users engaged. But now we focus on other things and other more scalable, I guess, growth levers and things like SEO and search traffic are one of them where we\u2019re improving the product and the site and exploring new ways to attract and solve for answers that people are searching for in Google for example. And things like that are kind of areas that we\u2019re looking into now. Now today we have a global community, it really has been global from day one, which some people underestimate, I think, how global it really is.", "People assume that because it\u2019s technology focused and because I\u2019m based in San Francisco and because a lot of the early people are in San Francisco, like investors and founders, they sort of assume it\u2019s a lot of Silicon Valley people and actually a very, very small percentage of people are from Silicon Valley. I think maybe, I think it\u2019s less than 1% are even in the Bay Area. , actually it\u2019s certainly less than 1%. And more than 50% of our audience are outside the US as well. So we really have kind of, I think, created a global brand to some extent where I\u2019ll even go to, I\u2019ve been to Tokyo, I\u2019ve been to Berlin, I\u2019ve been to France, I\u2019ve been all around the world where we\u2019ve hosted meet ups and gatherings and stuff with other Product Hunt community members. So anyway it\u2019s kind of cool. It\u2019s cool in that sense because it\u2019s not just a reflection of Silicon Valley technology, it\u2019s a reflection of the world and the technology that\u2019s been created all over the place.", "Nathan: Yeah, amazing. And are you able to share how many monthly visitors you get? How many products have been mentioned on the site? How many users do you guys have? I just, yeah, just, I guess, yeah, to really understand the scale.", "Ryan: Yeah, so we actually have intentionally kept private the numbers like monthly uniques, but to date \u2026 well, to give you sense of scale we\u2019ve had, last year, 2018 we did a count of how many people launched, how many products were on Product Hunt, we had over 20,000 products launched and some of those are everything from little side projects from people building cool things to big companies like Facebook or Stripe or public companies launching on Product Hunt. And it\u2019s also led to well over two million people, two million up votes last year we had. What else? I\u2019m trying to pull some other numbers that we\u2019ve shared. We have over a million people now, I should say over a million people registered, but we have well more than that visiting the site on a regular basis because most people actually don\u2019t log in. It\u2019s like a lot of other communities and sites where there\u2019s a lot of lurkers, there\u2019s a lot of lurkers that never register or never up vote, but they\u2019re visiting and they\u2019re exploring and they\u2019re clicking through and downloading and purchasing products and so, yeah, there\u2019s just kind of a wealth of lurkers out there that contribute in their own way.", "Nathan: Yeah. I\u2019m probably guilty of that. Yeah, look, the thing that I find to be honest, Ryan, is if I go on Product Hunt, I know I\u2019m going to lose just a truck tonne of time because you just find so many cool products. Like everybody loves geeking out on the latest app, the latest tech and, you know, at Foundr we pay for over 100 different SaaS tools so it\u2019s just scary for me sometimes because I know I\u2019m just going to get lost because the stuff that gets up voted is always the coolest cutting edge stuff, you know?", "Ryan: Yeah. We kind of, I mean we\u2019ve tried to design this rabbit hole to some extent, which some people might see as counterproductive. But I like to think, and of course I\u2019m biassed, I like to think that it\u2019s a productive procrastination. In that you, instead of, you know, looking at maybe cat photos or memes on the internet, at least you\u2019re spending time exploring what people are building. And I think if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s excited to build a company in the future or if you\u2019re a product manager or whatever your role is, I think there\u2019s actually a lot of value in searching for inspiration. In kind of the same way that artists go and explore different \u2026 either travel or they go to museums or musicians will listen to other artists and other genres of music to get inspiration for their own ideas, I think the same is true for people that are building products.", "You might discover a product that maybe you\u2019re not only a user of, but they approach their landing and marketing positioning in a unique way that is inspiring. Or you download an app and they have a really unique onboarding flow that might inspire your own onboarding flow or approach in the future. So I don\u2019t know, I think, I actually know that there are some colleges that prescribe and sort of require their students to go on Product Hunt and visit every single day because they know that there\u2019s value in staying plugged into what people are building and finding inspiration in that way.", "Nathan: Yeah. I agree. I know that \u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s still the case, I assume it is, they used to say that a lot of VCs, that\u2019s where they spend their time now, looking for the next thing that might be a unicorn. And I know you guys have, you know, because you\u2019ve been around for so, for a decent amount of time, there are some companies that have, they first got their home run on Product Hunt and then they\u2019ve gone on to be a unicorn or whatever. So yeah, no, I think it\u2019s always a great way as well to just see trends in the market. Sometimes I go on there just to look, and you can run searches, right? Where, if I know that there\u2019s an app, so let\u2019s just say you talked about legendary onboarding, like superhuman, like incredible onboarding, legendary. And if you wanted to go and find an app that helps you manage your email better, then you can run a search and you can find all the different apps. So sometimes when I\u2019m thinking, okay, what is the new latest and greatest webinar software out there I\u2019ll go on Product Hunt, see what the latest cool stuff is because it might be a tool that\u2019s not on my radar that has just recently come out and that\u2019s on the cutting edge or it\u2019s something different. So yeah, there\u2019s a lot of different uses for your product.", "Ryan: Yeah. What we\u2019ve built over time, which may not be obvious to a lot of people, is for years we\u2019ve been also making associations of products. Meaning when a new product launches, let\u2019s say some new webinar product to kind of use your example, we\u2019ll often associate both manually and programmatically related products to that. So you\u2019ll be able to kind of discover and ultimately map out these relationships. Okay, here\u2019s this new product, but here are also the other ones that launched previously that are related to that product. And we\u2019re over time kind of mapping out in some ways this product graph of all the products out there that are related in some way. And some of them are alternatives to a particular product, some of them are complimentary products, things that are useful to also use in addition to that product and so that\u2019s kind of where a lot of our efforts around SEO have also been effective. Building out destinations for people to discover alternatives or complementary products to ones that they might already use.", "Nathan: That\u2019s interesting. So you\u2019re trying to make the app, or the website, as sticky as possible?", "Ryan: Yeah. And build almost more value over time. Because as more products get added we create more relationships to create more density around the data that we collect. And it really becomes kind of the unique and proprietary graph of sorts of kind of a \u2026 and then also in some ways our archaeology of what\u2019s launched in the past. Now that we\u2019re five plus years old we\u2019ll see products that \u2026 some die and don\u2019t work out, some of them get acquired, some of them go on and become a unicorn. You can go back and look at the Foundr responses and answers to questions, you know, multiple years ago. Which as someone who really geeks out on that kind of stuff, I sort of enjoy reflecting and reviewing people\u2019s thoughts at that time. Not knowing what the product would become in the future.", "Nathan: Yeah. So that is very interesting. So do you check the site every day? Are you still kind of part of that auditing team and looking at the latest products? Do you still check it every day?", "Ryan: Yeah, yeah. That\u2019s my \u2026 the first thing I do is open up Product Hunt in the morning. And it\u2019s a combination of going through Slack and catching up with my team and then seeing what\u2019s on Product Hunt. And, you know, some people think or assume that, oh, you must know what\u2019s on the site and every morning you kind of already know what\u2019s coming, but I actually don\u2019t. Just like everyone else I wake up and I\u2019m just like everyone else, discovering what\u2019s launching and what\u2019s happening. And in most cases I don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming, every now and then I know what\u2019s being scheduled and what\u2019s kind of coming in the pipeline, but a lot of times I\u2019m coming up to discover new products for the first time. And I still enjoy it. I\u2019m still just like a consumer. If I wasn\u2019t incented, I guess, to be involved in Product Hunt, I\u2019d still be a good user I think.", "Nathan: Yeah. Awesome. I\u2019d love to talk about the acquisition with AngelList. How did that come about?", "Ryan: Yeah. So going back to our first round of funding, so we did two rounds of funding, one was a seed round and we got some great people on board there. One of those investors was Naval from AngelList and then we went through YCombinator and then we also raised a round with Andreessen Horowitz and that was all back in 2014. And fast forward to 2016 time frame, we were exploring kind of the next stages of the company and transparently it was a combination of do we raise a series B and grow the team and pursue some of the vision that we have for the company, or do we pursue acquisitions? And we were transparently pursuing both at once. And I think this is something that\u2019s important for founders to really internalise, optionality is so important meaning you don\u2019t want just one option for anything. Ideally you have multiple and that gives you flexibility and control over your destiny, ultimately. And so we pursued both of those directions and the most natural fit was with AngelList and that relationship started off in the beginning days, back in 2014 when Naval invested. So having that conversation around, what would this look like if we worked together and were acquired by AngelList and how could we ultimately support the tech community and makers and founders even better together?", "And so now it\u2019s been over two years since the acquisition and we still remain as very much independent business units inside of AngelList and that\u2019s similar to how the entire organisation operates. There\u2019s also the venture business and the talent business which are also separate business units, effectively. But the commonality is that we\u2019re all building for the tech community, trying to support makers and founders and just doing it in very different ways.", "Nathan: Interesting. So when that occurred, AngelList are based in San Francisco as well, did you guys even move into the same office and get the [embeddedment 00:26:26] of the AngelList culture? Or are you guys still fairly isolated in your own office?", "Ryan: Kind of a combination of both actually. So Product Hunt\u2019s unique in that we\u2019re a distributed team and have been from the beginning, so we currently, we used to have more people in San Francisco, but the way the team has kind of evolved is we have just myself and Jac, Jacqueline who joined almost around four years ago now. Just her and I are in San Francisco now and the rest are spread across the world. We\u2019re across 10 different countries, I think is the latest count. And so we\u2019ve remained distributed, so we\u2019re \u2026 well, I work in the office every now and then, we can also kind of work from anywhere so that\u2019s remained separate. We have our own Slack team and we have our own kind of processes and ways of building. And then the ways that we kind of connect with the company are I sync up with Kevin, the CEO of AngelList, once a week, do our one-on-ones. I also sync across the team once a week, so we\u2019re sort of in touch but thankfully we don\u2019t have a lot of politics or overhead or meetings, I guess, for the sake of meetings just because we\u2019re in a bigger organisation. So there\u2019s a lot of flexibility given.", "And I think the truth is regarding culture, that was actually a really serious, that was an important consideration in the acquisition. Because that\u2019s where a lot of acquisitions can go sour, there could be a wildly different culture or vision for the company and if that\u2019s not aligned then it\u2019s probably not going to work out long term. So for us the AngelList culture is not the same to be honest and yet we have a lot of parallels and a lot of similarities. And I think that\u2019s actually a good thing. It\u2019s sort of like when you hire a teammate, you don\u2019t want them to be just like you. Ideally they have a similar belief and mission as yourself, but also have different skills and different areas of focus and that\u2019s kind of how I think about AngelList and Product Hunt. AngelList is very much a product engineering driven culture and I would describe Product Hunt as very much a product and community driven culture. And yet we both have similar passions around technology and supporting founders. The way that we kind of approach that mission is just different and I think that\u2019s a good thing.", "Nathan: Yeah, wow, that\u2019s really interesting. So I\u2019d like to switch gears as well and talk about a tool that you guys have launched. It sounds or seems like you guys are going to continue to produce tools to support your community. So Ship, I saw that and I thought it was quite interesting. Was that inspired by, post the acquisition, that you guys should build tools or how did that all come about?", "Ryan: Yeah, so this was, like a lot of products and things we\u2019ve built, it was initially inspired by the community and the way that people were using Product Hunt. So what we observed is there were a number of people that use a variety of tools to essentially get feedback and get email sign ups for their products while they\u2019re building it, so they\u2019ll piece together maybe like Squarespace or Wix or some landing page or they\u2019ll spend days designing and coding their own landing page, so that\u2019s one. Two, they would oftentimes sign up for something like Mailchimp or some email service to deliver emails and updates to this audience. And then sort of a third tool that they would use oftentimes is something like Typeform or some survey tool. And we realised we saw this happening quite often and our vision for Ship was, okay, well we have a bunch of people who are on product hunt that are going to launch something. We also have this belief that a lot of people launch without gathering feedback, without building an audience, without building community. And we feel that, one, more people should probably talk to their users really early and, in fact, we\u2019ve kind of tried to embrace building public culture where we are actively sharing things that we\u2019re working on and sharing even mock ups sometimes before we build it with our community to gather feedback.", "So the inspiration for Ship was based around all these observations and beliefs and the goal with Ship is to create a simple tool that kind of aggregates all three of those tools in one. So it\u2019s an easy way to create a landing page for your product, easy way to collect emails for those interested in trying out your product and it also has it\u2019s own email delivery tool so you can send updates to those people, ask them questions and then lastly there\u2019s a survey tool, so if you want to better understand your users or get their feedback through a survey, you can do that all through Ship. And what\u2019s nice about that is it\u2019s centralised, it\u2019s all in one tool, versus having something like Squarespace and Mailchimp and Typeform, which all aren\u2019t connected and in sync. It can make it really challenging to operate all three of those tools at once.", "So yeah, we launched Ship a while back and it\u2019s sort of to Product Hunt as most people know it, but very complementary because it\u2019s serving a very similar goal for our audience.", "Nathan: I agree there is way too many tools and there will have to be a point of consolidation, even if it is not happening right now. There are just way too many tools. Like I said before, we pay for at least over 100 different SaaS products.", "Ryan: Wow.", "Nathan: I\u2019m curious though, with a tool like Ship, why would people use it after they\u2019ve launched or after a certain period of time once they\u2019re working on the product? Is there a reason for people to stick around? That\u2019s the one thing I was curious \u2026 because it\u2019s really launch focused, right?", "Ryan: Yeah. Yeah, that\u2019s actually a positioning challenge that we have. People think of it as a launch tool, so a tool to collect emails leading up to the launch, but the reality is people are always launching. You\u2019re always building some new feature or iterating on the product and furthermore you should also probably be talking to your users after your launch, not just before. And so we see Ship is really being a tool that could be used throughout the entire development process and yet transparently a lot of people don\u2019t see it as a tool post launch and I think that\u2019s a challenge we have in maybe educating and informing people how the tool could be used post launch.", "Nathan: How do you plan to tackle that?", "Ryan: It\u2019s a tough one because right now we\u2019re not active, we\u2019re exploring some other products and Ship is sort of in the \u2026, so we have a lot of people using it. We\u2019ve seen, I forget the exact number, but several million emails collected through the service in 2018. All of those emails are potential beta testers and users of these products and right now we\u2019ve been focusing on some other efforts. This year\u2019s goal is to focus on user growth. Last year\u2019s goal was revenue and as a result, and I haven\u2019t really shared this publicly, but we\u2019re profitable in our business unit. So we\u2019re not burning, we\u2019re making more money than we\u2019re burning let\u2019s say. So now it\u2019s sort of this user growth initiative, we\u2019re actually focusing more on some other projects that could lead to growing the community\u2026So Ship is sort of on ice right now. It\u2019s used by a lot of people, but it\u2019s not our active focus at this time.", "Nathan: Yeah, no, that makes sense. Thank you for being so transparent and honest with me, Ryan. I\u2019m curious around, you said you had a focus of revenue last year and congratulations, you guys are profitable, I know that\u2019s not an easy feat, so congratulations. And one thing I did pick up was the theme. So commonly how you typically run Product Hunt as the CEO is you have themed years where you focus on just one thing and that\u2019s how you rally and align and get buy-in from your team around focus?", "Ryan: Yeah. We\u2019ve tried to remain focused on one particular kind of mission each year and we haven\u2019t always done this. So we are certainly more, I think, buttoned up and structured than we\u2019ve ever been. And so this year user growth is our number one goal. And actually the way that we structured our KPIs, we have three of them. We used to have four, four is too many in my opinion. It seems somewhat like a small deal, three versus four, but four feels like too much, it\u2019s hard to manage four main KPIs. So we have three, one of them, number one goal is user growth and that\u2019s measured just in the form of unique visitors, actually, visiting our platform. And that could be Product Hunt, it could be our mobile apps, it could be our Chrome extension, newsletter. Basically across our entire platform. And the second goal is community contributions which is measured by unique people who are up voting, commenting and engaging in some way. And the reason why that\u2019s important is it\u2019s essentially kind of the health of the community. If, for example, we had nobody up voting, nobody commenting, obviously we\u2019d have nothing and nothing would happen, there\u2019d be no use for anyone. And so growing that and making sure that\u2019s healthy is important.", "And then the third and last priority is revenue. So revenue is something that we have specific targets on and end goals to reach at the end of the year. And it\u2019s important, but it\u2019s not as important as user growth because our goal isn\u2019t actually to make \u2026 it\u2019d be great if we made 10 million dollars this year, but that\u2019s not necessarily our focus right now. I think what\u2019s more important for us is to build an awesome brand, community and grow it, make it bigger. And by doing that it\u2019ll make it easier for us to make more money in the future. And so we\u2019re thinking about sequencing events like this. Last year I mentioned revenue was important, but part of that which is sort of implied is it was actually more about building the business model and figuring out a way to make money that was healthy and sustainable. And not so much about the money itself, but actually the way of making money was what we were prioritising.", "Nathan: Yeah, interesting. That makes sense. So what I\u2019m envisioning or seeing is you guys have built up this incredible community of makers and founders and as you continue to grow that user base, you can kind of bolt on other products or services where you can further facilitate the maker\u2019s or founder\u2019s growth of their companies or growth as founders. Is that kind of the plan? Is there any cross-pollination because you guys were acquired by AngelList? There\u2019s obviously power there. Does much cross-selling or cross-promotion go on? Or is it still quite isolated?", "Ryan: Yeah, we have a little bit but we\u2019ve not explored that as much. And it\u2019s not because there aren\u2019t opportunities, we have a lot of ideas around that, it\u2019s just because it hasn\u2019t been top priority for us or other business units. So we don\u2019t have a lot of kind of integrations or forced cross-promotion. But we do have some plans around \u2026 the reality is we have an audience of many talented people who may be looking for the next job, for example. We also have a lot of people who are looking to hire amazing people and so there\u2019s some pretty clear and obvious ways that we can work with the talent side of the business which has in many ways perfected the process of hiring and recruiting in tech. And so we have some plans around that, but we, like other acquisitions, you sometimes see people forcing some of those things maybe prematurely or in ways that don\u2019t feel organic or authentic. And so it hasn\u2019t been the kind of top priority for us this time.", "Nathan: Yeah, interesting. Yeah, because if you think of AngelList, when I think of AngelList I know that\u2019s a great way to hire tech talent and we put job ads on there all the time. So yeah, there could be incredible cross-pollination if user growth is a focus for you guys, but yeah, interesting.", "Ryan: Yeah. It does lead to longer term opportunities, for lack of a better phrase, one plus one equals three, so by coming together and leveraging the talent and the technology that the talent team has built, we\u2019re able to do some things that wouldn\u2019t be possible independently.", "Nathan: Yeah, interesting. I\u2019m surprised as well there\u2019s no update in branding. Sometimes when there\u2019s acquisitions you see, you know, by the company. So Product Hunt by AngelList or how Atlassian have acquired all these companies and as time goes on it\u2019s like, you know, Trello eventually by Atlassian. Is that coming do you think?", "Ryan: No. Well it didn\u2019t seem to make sense. The brands are intentionally separate and some people actually, a lot of people don\u2019t even know that Product Hunt was acquired and if you look at the Product Hunt website I don\u2019t know, maybe probably somewhere in our ToS you\u2019ll find AngelList mentioned, but you won\u2019t find it explicitly on the site because it doesn\u2019t add value in putting the AngelList brand beside Product Hunt. I think it\u2019s important, especially for communities, to feel authentic and feel like their own thing and I think this is also, you see this in other forms too, even at bigger scale, like when you look at Facebook and Facebook launches a new product, very rarely will you see Facebook\u2019s branding anywhere. You might see it in the ToS or the footer somewhere, but Instagram, a lot of people use Instagram and don\u2019t even know that Facebook owns it. I wouldn\u2019t doubt if 50% of it\u2019s users don\u2019t know that Facebook is the owner of Instagram. Same with WhatsApp. I bet you 90+ percent of people don\u2019t know that WhatsApp is owned by Facebook as well. So things like that I think can create a network of properties and brands and keeping those independent I think is important, at least for us.", "Nathan: Yeah I agree. That makes 100% sense. Well look, Ryan, we have to work towards wrapping up. Really enjoyed the conversation. You shared a lot of incredible insights and experiences that I\u2019m sure our community will learn from. My final question is, well two more questions, one, where\u2019s the best place people can find out more about yourself and your work? And then the second one is just, yeah, any parting wisdom that you\u2019d like to share to finish off on.", "Ryan: Yeah, so I think I\u2019m kind of on all the social networks. I\u2019m on Twitter quite a bit, I also write on Medium a bit every now and then. I\u2019m hoping to do a little bit more writing, I used to write a lot more pre Product Hunt. And let\u2019s see, what else? What was the other question you asked me? I lost track.", "Nathan: Just any final parting words of advice or something you wish you would have liked me to ask you or just like to share. Just wanted to leave the space open.", "Ryan: Yeah, no, I think the thing I keep seeing, sort of a common theme among a lot of makers or founders, a lot of them, it\u2019s easier than ever to build a product for a lot of things and as a result we\u2019re seeing more people build products. And that\u2019s great, it\u2019s great to see and it\u2019s also one of the reasons why I believe Product Hunt\u2019s increasingly important in the future, but the challenge with that is how do you break out? How do you get the attention? How do you get users? And I think a lot of people build really cool products and if their goal is to build something that\u2019s used by people, they oftentimes skip over the most important step which is, okay, how am I going to get people to use this thing? And it seems like a sort of basic question, but some people get wrapped up in designing the product and thinking through how the product will work without thinking about building growth into the product or how it\u2019s going to be marketed or what channels they\u2019ll reach into.", "So I think that\u2019s one of the biggest just themes I\u2019ve noticed among a lot of different founders or makers. Figure out how to get users first before even designing the product. Or rather design the product with growth in mind so that the product grows itself as more people use the product, for example. So I think that\u2019s just an area that more people should be considering when they\u2019re building something from scratch.", "Nathan: Amazing. Well look, thank you so much for your time, Ryan, really appreciate it, really enjoyed our conversation and congratulations on all your success and, yeah, thank you so much, mate.", "Ryan: Yeah, thanks Nathan.

Then in 2017, they acquired Tagged, the San Francisco-based meeting app with high engagement in the African-American community, and Lovoo, a European dating app. And this year, The Meet Group also acquired GROWLr, a dating app geared toward the gay community.", "But Cook says all of these acquisitions stemmed from a strategy inspired by one popular Chinese dating app. The company decided to start building a live-streaming video product after seeing its success at a Chinese dating platform called Momo.", "Cook felt the app was somewhat similar to Meet Me, and when Momo added live streaming, he says that about 90 percent of Momo\u2019s revenue was a result of that service. The Meet Group wanted to give it a try.", "\u201cWe were also kind of clear-eyed enough to know that building a live-streaming business is a big commitment,\u201d Cook says. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially kind of an all-in sort of company bet.\u201d", "It was the kind of bet Cook was comfortable making. So they dove in headfirst and got to work building up the infrastructure, talent, and moderation capabilities they would need to execute their plan. And it paid off in tens of millions.

This became the inspiration behind their acquisition of meeting and dating apps\u2014to integrate video and watch as revenues skyrocketed.", "\u201cIf we believed in our story enough to make that bet, well, then we could make that bet again and again,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason not to double down, triple down, quadruple down on it.\u201d", "As they acquired social apps and fitted live-streamed video into them, they noticed that the engagement on those apps markedly increased.", "\u201cIn meeting- and dating- and chat-oriented communities, there\u2019s often periods of time where you just don\u2019t have any inbound chats,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, it\u2019s kind of boring.\u201d", "But rather than exiting the app, the users of the video-fitted apps can simply hop into the tab labeled \u201cLive\u201d during those gaps.", "\u201cOur users are coming to us for human connection,\u201d he says. \u201cMeeting new people is kind of all about that. Interactive live video is actually human connection, right?\u201d", "Cook says that around 20 percent of their users visit the live streaming sections of the apps each day and that those users, on average, spend 20 minutes more a day on the app. Users can watch popular streamers, send them comments and witness their reactions. They can also buy and send digital gifts to the streamer.", "\u201cThey do this because they want the attention of the streamer,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like buying someone a drink at the bar.

Thirty percent of the Chinese app\u2019s users visit the live section daily, a goal that Cook wants to push toward.", "He also wants to continue pushing the boundaries of live video and sees one-on-one live video and various video dating experiences in the company\u2019s future.", "As the social media landscape continues to coalesce around a select few apps, this self-proclaimed tinkerer believes that the unique nature of his business will allow it to keep flourishing.", "After all, as long as there are people searching for connection, there will always be a need to meet someone new.", "Interview by Nathan Chan, feature article reprinted from Foundr Magazine, by Erica Comitalo", "Nathan: The first question that I ask everyone that comes on is, how did you get a job?", "Geoff: Yeah, I got my job, I guess by starting with the company. I started the company back in 2005. It was originally a social network for meeting new people. It\u2019s now mobile apps for meeting new people. So, not that dramatic a shift. But I started the company back in 2005. I went through a few different rounds of funding, ended up selling the company and then coming back and leading it again shortly thereafter. Have been leading it as a public company \u2026 Leading the company more or less for 14 years and then leading it as a public company for really the last, I guess six. That\u2019s essentially how I got the job. I created the company.", "Nathan: Yeah, wow. The Meet group, which was formerly Meet Me, this is your first business?", "Geoff: Actually, no, it\u2019s my second business. My first business I started at school and actually started editing business as a sophomore because I didn\u2019t want to get a library job. I didn\u2019t want to basically get a side job, which I kind of needed just to have some spending money. This was 1997, and ended up starting an editing business. Ecommerce, people would send documents, resumes, and so forth.", "I was the only editor as well as the CTO and everything else, website creator. That scaled to millions of dollars in revenue within just a few years. Then I sold that company to the Thompson Corporation in late 2002. That was my first business. This is essentially probably my second of size. I dabbled with an art community for a period of time too.", "Nathan: Wow, interesting. You started what was called MeetMe in 2005. Was that when you\u2019re in high school?", "Geoff: No. I actually went to Harvard and my first company I started at Harvard in 1997. MeetMe, I started, I must have probably been 24, 25 something like that. Oh, no, I guess I was 26. My brother and sister co-founded it with me and they were in high school. So, I\u2019m the older sibling and we co-founded it together. We actually launched MyYearbook, which was the predecessor name of MeetMe. We launched that in their high school. That was our starting point, Montgomery High School in Skillman, New Jersey. We got hundreds of people join in the first week or two, a million people would join in the next nine months.", "Nathan: Wow. What was first MyYearbook, what was the premise of the product?", "Geoff: It was pretty simple. It was conceived as a social network for meeting new people. Facebook was in one school, at Harvard at the time. MySpace was the dominant power in social. The thought was, there needs to be a place to connect to people you don\u2019t know. Just people around you. It seemed both MySpace and Facebook were heavy on connecting to your real life friends. Maybe MySpace a little less so, but still basically that was what it was about.", "MyYearbook was connecting to people you don\u2019t know. It made that easy through different fun games, and also just through the search algorithm itself. What helped really take off \u2026 I think we\u2019ve built a pretty good mousetrap in the beginning, but we had nobody in it. What really helped it take off was this was the times of MySpace. There was a lot of virality on these social platforms in the early days. We were able to create this great quiz app that ended up getting millions of users every month, they would take a quiz, like what Seinfeld character are you? What blank are you?", "You\u2019d answer some questions, they would give you the answer, and you\u2019d paste that answer into MySpace. If you recall, MySpace had very ugly profiles, anything goes and you could paste code. So, people were pasting our code. Our code would basically drive you to MyYearbook. We did a great job of converting quiz takers into registrants, and then filling our community that way. Then we basically turned \u2026 Quizzes are very high, unique business, you get a lot of uniques, but you get very few page views per unique, because you only basically need to see the quiz and the quiz result.", "We turned that business from two pages per user, to closer to the two or 300, because we brought them into a very social experience, and they started chatting with each other. That was when we were basically off to the races.", "Nathan: Yeah, wow. Interesting. What happened next?", "Geoff: We built the company up over \u2026 In the earliest days, it was really just all about growing the user base. We did that pretty well, a million users in nine months, the whole quiz thing that was going well. We did a few different concepts like that. It was time to start monetizing, and we had to raise some money, because the basic of the servers were melting, the traffic was growing, the expenses were going up.", "So, we raised a venture round from U.S Venture Partners in 2006. U.S Venture Partners in Sand Hill Road. Also, from First Round Capital, which was at the time in Pennsylvania. I think they have offices all around the world now. But First Round Capital and USUP was our first round.", "That allowed us to put a team together, put an office together. Many of those people in those early days are with us still. Then in 2008, we essentially got lucky. We did a Series B right before Lehman, literally the month before Lehman when we closed it. We raised 12.8 million that way. That would be the last venture capital we would raise. Then I sold the company, or merged it, I should say, into a public company in late 2011. Then came back as the CEO in early 2013.", "Nathan: Talk to me about listing the company, and then stepping down the CEO. Why did you guys decide to list? How far did you take MyYearbook, because you guys changed the name?", "Geoff: I think we were up to like, I don\u2019t remember exactly. But somewhere in the neighbourhood of 25 to 30 million in revenue at the time that we essentially sold. We sold to a public company because we felt like there was an opportunity to consolidate the market. We merged into a company called Que Pasa, and they had a social network for meeting new people too, but focused on South America.", "We thought, okay, we take our North America, we combine it with South America. What we ended up doing is basically, turning off Que Pasa and moving all of the traffic to MyYearbook. And then we renamed my yearbook to MeetMe, just to better reflect what we did. At the time, we were always a social network for meeting new people, but the name to people who didn\u2019t know that made people think of classmates.com. It was not really what we were about. So we changed the name to MeetMe, which we felt better reflected what we were about. Then we would eventually change the name of the company to the Meet Group to reflect that we now are a collection of apps, not just the one. We also have the Ticker Meet traded on NASDAQ.", "Nathan: Got you. When you sold, you stepped down. But how long was that? That didn\u2019t seem like it was very long.", "Geoff: Yeah, it wasn\u2019t very long. Part of the deal when we closed it in 2011, it was because of the liquidity went in the deal. I moved into the COO role. I worked closely with the CEO. I think there was an expectation that I would be CEO shortly, and that\u2019s basically what happened.", "Nathan: Got you. You left for a little bit, but then came back.", "Geoff: Well, I never really left. I was just COO briefly. As soon as I sold it to the other company, I was COO of the combined company for a period of time, and then became CEO of the combined company.", "Nathan: Got you. Then you guys decided to list not long after, right?", "Geoff: No, no. The company we merged into was public. That is how we are listed.", "Nathan: Got you. That\u2019s how you became a listed company. Got you. Okay, that makes sense. Interesting. Then you said, you guys now have a suite of apps. How come that came about?", "Geoff: That really started in 2016. We\u2019ve felt for some time that the space was consolidating. There\u2019s just natural network effects and social networks for meeting people. The more people you have on your network, the more value for any new person who comes to the network. Now, there\u2019s more people to meet. There\u2019s just natural network effects.", "But what I would say even drove it more was we decided in 2016 to start building a live streaming video product, in part because we saw that would be successful in China, in particular for a Chinese dating company called MOMO. We always felt like MOMO was similar to what we had in terms of the product. When they added live streaming, it just totally transformed their business model. Now, something like 90% of all their revenues, and they\u2019re a multi billion dollar company are coming from live streaming.", "But we noticed it pretty early. We said, well, let\u2019s build this. But, we were also clear eyed enough to know that building a live streaming business is a big commitment. It\u2019s essentially an all-in company. If you\u2019re going to build out all the needed infrastructure, talent, moderation capabilities for live streaming at scale, the more users, the better.", "If we believed in our story enough to make that bet, well, then we could make that bet again and again. There\u2019s no reason not to double down, triple down, quadruple down on it. That\u2019s what we did. We acquired another company called Scout, which was backed by Andreessen Horowitz. I guess that was late 2016. Then in 2017, we acquired two more companies. Scout was a meeting community, similar to MeetMe. I\u2019d known the founders for a long time.", "Then we acquired Tagged, an African American meeting community in 2017, was backed by Mayfield also, but based in San Francisco. Then in late 2017, we acquired a European dating community called LOVOO. Most recently, 2018 we really didn\u2019t acquire anything, we just really focused on those integrations and unrolling out live streaming video to all the properties we had acquired. We did do that by mid-2018. Most recently, we acquired a gay dating community called GROWLr. That was less than a month or about a month ago or so.", "Nathan: Okay, interesting. It seems that you guys are really snapping up companies. Why is that?", "Geoff: The reason is that we have seen what video has done now for us and for the companies we acquired. What live streaming video has done is take \u2026 Well, for one, we grew from zero to 82 million of annualised live video revenue in just 16 months. Just by adding live streaming video, we turned on this revenue stream. We\u2019ve managed to grow substantial revenue streams on every app that we did it to. We basically look at an app and we can say, \u201cOkay, we like this business. We like the underlying business. We\u2019re even to buyers generally. We feel like we\u2019re paying a reasonable price for the EBITDA, given our own EBITDA trading multiples.", "At the same time, we feel like we could turn on a new source of revenue that the company didn\u2019t have before. Every time we\u2019ve turned on this revenue, it\u2019s actually become the fastest growing product in the history of the company for all four of those apps. That\u2019s the whole narrative. It\u2019s basically we found that live streaming marries quite well to social meeting apps. We\u2019ve bought a bunch of them and we\u2019re executing on that strategy.", "Nathan: Wow, fascinating. Because with MyYearbook, it was more just around meeting people. But now it looks like you guys are acquiring dating apps as well. Yeah, you just bolt on the live streaming product. Basically, before they even meet for the date, they would live stream and then a certain amount of that live streaming time, they would have to pay for, or both parties would have to pay for. Is that correct, or do they have credits or something along those lines, right?", "Geoff: Yeah, it\u2019s credits based. Basically, the way it works is in meeting and dating and chat oriented communities, there\u2019s often periods of time where you just don\u2019t have any inbound chats. It\u2019s kind of boring and bore if that\u2019s the case. It might be exciting because you\u2019re chatting someone who\u2019s interested in responding to you. But then you\u2019re sending a bunch of outbounds, nobody\u2019s coming back to you. Then what do you do? You can go and leave the app, you can go do something else.", "But what we found is if you add a tab called Live, people will go into it. Only 20 plus percent of our users a day do this, which is pretty substantial. But the magic of is it takes those 20% of users and it extends their time by 20 plus minutes a day. Suddenly, you have a lot more time with the user. Our users are coming to us for human connection. Meeting new people is all about that. Interactive, live video is actually human connection. You\u2019re able to give comments, you\u2019re able to watch the person react to them. The monetization model is the viewers of the live streams actually give virtual gifts to the streamers. They do this because they want the attention of the streamer. In a popular live stream, you want to stand out. It\u2019s almost like buying someone a drink at the bar. You don\u2019t necessarily have to, but if you want a better shot then you maybe should. That\u2019s how it\u2019s worked out.", "Nathan: Got you. What I\u2019m hearing was from you guys, keeping an eye on a company in China bolting on this live streaming product and seeing that being a game changer, and then effectively modelling that model to your business and everything you guys are doing has been a massive game changer for you.", "Geoff: Yes, that\u2019s exactly right.", "Nathan: Wow, that\u2019s fascinating. Now, is the game plan, as long as you guys can afford it to just keep acquiring other meeting properties, or social networking properties?", "Geoff: That\u2019s certainly part of our strategies is to expand into adjacent \u2026 Obviously, we just acquired a gay dating app. We\u2019ll always look at opportunities that maybe add audiences or niches that we don\u2019t have. But I would say the primary strategy is to grow our live streaming organic business. We have, today, 20% of our users on Live. We know, and obviously we got started a little bit after MOMO, but we know that they got 30% of their users online.", "We feel like there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t get from 20% to 30%. There\u2019s enough interesting products and features in our pipeline that we haven\u2019t released yet that we think will help us close that gap and bring more users into the system. With more users in the system, we would expect monetization rates to go up. There\u2019s two levers. There\u2019s number of video users you have. Then there\u2019s the amount you monetize those video users by.", "We still feel like we\u2019re at pretty early days on these metrics. A lot of our focus is on just how do you grow? How do you get people into video? Right now, most of our videos is broadcast video. One to many, or two to many Live video. We\u2019re going to be building out one on one video, live streaming video. We\u2019re looking at different dating experiences to bring into the app. A lot of our users are there to meet new people and date, but our Live video product doesn\u2019t really serve them as much as it serves the entertainment solution.", "We just feel like there\u2019s a lot of opportunities ahead of us that we\u2019re going to be going after for the next year. I\u2019d say that\u2019s what we\u2019re mainly focused on. At the same time, if the right deal came about at the right price, and we felt there was a video narrative, we would at least look at it.", "Nathan: Yeah, I see. Are your brother and sister still active in the business?", "Geoff: Yes, my sister is. My brother has actually moved on. He\u2019s actually working and I\u2019m backing that. He\u2019s working on something in the podcasting space, a project called Podcoin. Which basically pays you to listen to podcasts, basically gives you loyalty points. You earn these loyalty points by how many hours of podcasts you listen to, and then you can redeem them for things like Starbucks gift cards, or Amazon gift cards and things like that.", "He\u2019s been doing that for the last, I would say, seven or eight months. It\u2019s only been live for the last four months, but it\u2019s been growing pretty quick. Got to about a million listening minutes a day in four months, which I thought was quite impressive on a shoestring budget.", "Nathan: Wow, interesting. Podcasting. gamified.", "Geoff: Exactly.", "Nathan: Interesting. Would it be safe to say, Geoff, and please, mistake my naivety but would it be safe to say that in the early days of starting MyYearbook back in the early days when there was a lot of different social networks, and that market really consolidated. Then there\u2019s been some players that have clearly emerged that have stuck around Facebook, Twitter, and the like, et cetera, et cetera. You guys were one of those products or apps that, obviously didn\u2019t win that battle. But you guys have been able to pivot and still now, you really carving out a blue ocean almost 15 years later?", "Geoff: I\u2019m not sure I would characterise it quite that way. Only because MyYearbook was focused on meeting new people from basically, the beginning. We never felt like a head to head competitor to really either Facebook or MySpace. With that being said, there\u2019s something to what you\u2019re saying. Because two of the apps we own, I would say are more like that. One is called Tagged and the other is Hi5. I didn\u2019t even mention Hi5, because it\u2019s not one of our bigger apps. But those were two \u2026 I would say, MyYearbook, Tagged and Hi5, all three of those were somewhere in the 2004, 2005 timeframe. Very early social network pioneers that are now meet new people apps and do quite well in that framework.", "Nathan: Wow, interesting. What\u2019s it like to run a public company? Is it so much tougher than being private?", "Geoff: There\u2019s a lot more that\u2019s similar, I\u2019d say than different. In a private venture backed company, you have large investors who are very knowledgeable of the business and are demanding growth. I would say a public company essentially has the same thing. There\u2019s also many, many more shareholders in a public company. That does change things. There\u2019s also the quarterly \u2026 Well, in a private company, you may have quarterly board meetings, and you probably do or maybe even more frequent. In a public company, these are very public affairs, and you have this stock price that goes up and down and the team has to come to deal with the vagaries of the market in that way.", "I would say, that can be difficult. But at the same time, there\u2019s clear advantages too. I think, it would have been hard for us to acquire Scout, our first deal if we couldn\u2019t issue some stock to do that deal. It probably would have been harder for us to raise the money to get Tagged if we weren\u2019t public either. We acquired LOVOO and GROWLr with all debt. But I would say our access to Capital Markets is definitely held by being public.", "I would say that, the acquisitions we made probably wouldn\u2019t have happened if we weren\u2019t public. There\u2019s definitely pros and cons of being public. But I would say we had more pro than con.", "Nathan: No, for sure, that makes sense. I\u2019m really interested to hear, when you think of an entrepreneur\u2019s dream pipeline when they start a company. It gets traction, and it\u2019s growing and you\u2019re building a team and you\u2019re scaling and you\u2019ve got product market fit, and you\u2019re doing all these incredible things and it\u2019s really exciting. Majority of founders pipe dream is to either sell the company or take it public so a form of liquidity will take place.", "I\u2019m curious around, what would your advice be around knowing or going down the model of taking the company public? Not that you have done it, but I\u2019m just curious to hear your perspective. At what point in time, should you even consider something like that?", "Geoff: I think the best time to be public would be when you have a lot of insight into your future revenues and profits. Because one of the key differences of a public versus private company is you publicly guide, or at least many do, or even most, guide to your revenue and EBITDA, or maybe your profit margins. But you offer some guidance for the year or maybe even long term guidance on how the business is going to go. Then you\u2019re measured to a quarterly yardstick on that.", "If you don\u2019t have enough insight into your business to know your revenues, except within a very wide range, or to know your profit except within a very wide range, that\u2019s probably not the best candidate to be public. You might go to tell a story where you can take something like that public, but that\u2019s difficult. Because you\u2019re just setting yourself up to have some really bad quarters.", "If you have some predictability on your traffic, some predictability on your revenues and EBITDA. You\u2019re never going to know everything, and they\u2019ll always be some surprises because things happen. But when you generally have good insights, that\u2019s when you want to start thinking about it. I think there is some scale too, somewhere north of hundreds of millions of revenue. Some companies have obviously gone public with no EBITDA or big losses. We look for margins in the 20% range.", "If you\u2019re going public with losses, that\u2019s a tough game, but people play it. Some of the biggest high flyers play that game. But I\u2019ve heard of rules of thumb of like, 100 million of EBITDA, 400 or 500 million of revenue. Every time you move up a valuation chart, if you\u2019re sub $100 million public company, in terms of total valuation, you have different investors who can own you. You probably have less liquidity in the shares. It\u2019s often called a micro-cap hell. It\u2019s hard to break through to the next level. Then you do it and we did it. But if you can get up to that half a billion yard stick, then that\u2019s even better. If you get up to that billion yardstick, that\u2019s even better.", "A pathway to a billion dollar market cap, you\u2019d like to have a line of sight, I would say, if you\u2019re going to think about going public.", "Nathan: Yeah. Okay, that makes sense. That was great insights. You talked about being an EBITDA first company. What did you mean by that?", "Geoff: I\u2019m not sure I said EBITDA first. I would say, EBITDA is important. I would say, our goal is to grow our revenues, grow our EBITDA, please our users. But what I mean by EBITDA, is EBITDA is, of course, a measure of profitability, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation. It tends to be, at least in the software industry, the mobile, internet tends to be what companies talk about.", "If you have EBITDA margins in the 20% range, that\u2019s pretty solid. In the 30%, 40% range, it\u2019s even better. When I say we manage for EBITDA, you always have this decision to make when you\u2019re running a company. Like, do you take that profit that you\u2019re turning, and do you just plough it all into marketing or plough it all into building out new teams, and try to run at breakeven as a strategic matter? Or do you allow yourself to have a margin?", "That\u2019s one of the key differences as a public company than a private. A private, you might run at 0% for a long time in terms of margin. In a public company, that\u2019s only going to work if your top line\u2019s growing exceedingly well, and you have line of sight so you\u2019re continuing to do so. It\u2019s hard to do that.", "I think that the play you tend to see more in public companies is they mind their EBITDA, they try to expand margins while also growing revenues. That\u2019s what we do.", "Nathan: Yeah, that\u2019s really difficult because usually you can only have one or the other, right?", "Geoff: It\u2019s always a balancing act. It\u2019s always a balancing act. But I think like everything, when you have constraints, sometimes that\u2019s when you do your best work because you do have constraints. But yeah, it\u2019s a balancing act. You could always say, look, we\u2019re going to spend more this quarter because we see this opportunity ahead of us. There still is some flexibility. But for the most part, we see it as how do we grow our revenues while growing our margins too?", "Nathan: Yeah. You raised a really good point around sacrificing profit for growth and how much margin do you manage? Early stage companies, you find that it\u2019s take the market, and everyone is sacrificing profit for growth quite aggressively a lot of the times. Especially venture funded companies, because, yes, investors want growth. That\u2019s a question that every founder, I think has on their mind around, I guess, how aggressive do you be, because it comes down to your risk tolerance as well. What advice would you have to people around managing that risk?", "Geoff: I would say, if your top line is growing 50% to 100% a year, you should not be worried about EBITDA. If your DAU is growing 10% week over week, the last thing you should be thinking about is EBITDA. The first couple years of MyYearbook, there was no revenue product. There was not even really a thought of it. I\u2019m of the belief that if you can amass a big enough audience, and what is big enough for me is a different question.", "But I tend to think it\u2019s, you have a million DAU, that\u2019s big, 10 million is better. But a million is big. If you can amass a big enough audience, you can monetize it. Especially if it\u2019s an engaged audience that\u2019s spending 10 or 20 or 30 minutes a day with you. Media tends to monetize at a certain rate. How many cents per hour can you make? I would never start off a mobile or social play, one that relates to how much traffic you can have, and say, \u201cWell, I know what my revenue model is.\u201d", "The first trick would be getting your users in the door. It\u2019d be nice to have a line of sight to a revenue model, but a lot of times, you may not even have that. It\u2019s really just, can you bring in the users? I would say, at least in the MyYearbook case, we basically spent two, maybe three years without any monetization. We started adding our monetization products when we basically said, okay, we don\u2019t really want to do too many rounds of venture capital when we raised in 2008. Maybe it was because Lehman Brothers had just happened. We vowed to ourselves, that that would be the last venture capital we raised. When you make such a vow, you\u2019re going to have to monetize, and then that\u2019s what we did.", "Nathan: Wow, interesting. Look, thanks so much for sharing, Geoff. Its been a fascinating conversation. Two of my last questions for you would be the first one, what\u2019s the best piece of advice you\u2019d like to share with our audience in, I guess, parting words? Then also, where\u2019s the best place to find out more about yourself and your work?", "Geoff: I would say, I think sometimes I\u2019m asked how do you start something like this? What I\u2019ve found to be true is you just get started. If you\u2019ve got an idea for something, and you\u2019re sitting on it, you can be sure it\u2019s not going to go anywhere. I tend to be a tinkerer. I\u2019ll push forward an idea even if it seemed strange, just because there\u2019s an itch, and just keep moving the ball forward. Sometimes opportunities fall out of that. Sometimes you just lose a lot of money. But it\u2019s an itch I had to scratch.", "I would say, when I\u2019m trying to weigh how much money something might cost to develop, a lot of times, I\u2019ll look at a framework that \u2026 I think Bezos talked about it, I don\u2019t remember who said it. But it\u2019s a regret minimization framework. 10 years from now, what will I have regretted? Losing half a million dollars or not having done the thing that I wanted? That\u2019s an interesting way of thinking about it. Because it gives you the long term perspective.", "As far as where people can reach me, I think I\u2019m on Twitter as Geoff Cook, G-E-O-F-F Cook. I have a website, geoffreycook.com. I\u2019m actually a children\u2019s book author on the side as well. But my apps are MeetMe. You can find that on App Store or Play Store. I would say probably that\u2019s a good one to start with. Or Podcoin, you can get that on App Store or Play Store, too.", "Nathan: Awesome. Well, look, thanks so much for your time, Geoff.

You\u2019re going to be quite disappointed. So the idea that you develop the market before, or at the exact same time as your product, right along the way, as you\u2019re building it, is just a much better concept in my eyes.\u201d", "After scaling a few multimillion-dollar companies, van Riel has perfected a repeatable formula for success.

But the bad news is that influencer may not always follow through and post about your product.", "And then you\u2019re in a tight spot. Because there was no monetary compensation involved, it\u2019s difficult to follow up in a meaningful way.", "On the other hand, when you pay an influencer, it completely changes the dynamic, because now it\u2019s a business relationship.", "\u201cOften, paying them is going to be less work in the long run,\u201d van Riel says.

What\u2019s important is that you decide from the start what you will be measuring.

Plus, your micro-influencers will have had exposure to your brand through seeing it on feed. So you\u2019re much more likely to then be able to pursue them for just a product-for-post or a cheaper post than usual.\u201d", "That\u2019s when the micro-influencers can come in and create branded content that will inspire user-generated content from your customers.", "This technique builds an entire ecosystem that, when managed properly, can thrive and spark a whole lot of growth and sales for your brand.", "SkinnyMe Tea: How 1 Instagram Post Led to $1,000 in Sales in 1 Day", "The timing was perfect.

You guys told us that you, you know, wanted to start a business, didn\u2019t know where to start.

I got my job now, I guess, back in 2012. I was working in a digital marketing role at a print-turning digital agency, and I just\u2026every day, when I go home from work at 5:00-ish, I\u2019d be coming up with different ideas all the time, and wanted to kind of pursue those at the same time. And I guess it was just something that turned from a passion project or a hobby into something that I was able to pursue full-time, and that was SkinnyMe Tea.", "Nathan: Gotcha. So how did you get started on SkinnyMe Tea, getting into e-commerce? What made you wanna start a business back in 2012? Yeah, did you read any books, or what\u2026well, actually you thought, \u201cOh, okay, well\u2026\u201d", "Gretta: No, no. I was just always coming up with different ideas and kind of half-pursuing them, but not really thinking\u2026I definitely didn\u2019t think about the word \u201centrepreneurship,\u201d the idea of starting a business, anything like that. That was not very common discourse back then in Melbourne in 2011, 2012. It was nowhere near as popular. Basically, I just had an idea that resonated with me so strongly that I just knew that it was something that I was going to have to pursue, and that idea was of a \u201cteatox,\u201d\u00a0 so a detox with tea. I\u2019d been trying a lot of different teas on the market, and making my own blends from different herbs that I\u2019d buy, like, in bulk from our local health food store, and I\u2019d just been playing with those, and people at work started asking me whether they could try my, like, detox with tea.", "And it wasn\u2019t until I kind of thought of that word and that concept, \u201cteatox,\u201d that I could really\u2026that was kind of my lightbulb moment where I could kind of identify with something and it was this concrete term, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I\u2019m doing. This is what this product is, and this is what I\u2019m going to sell.\u201d But basically, it just, it grew quite organically because people from work were asking me whether they could try my detox of tea, so \u201cteatox\u201d in the end, and I was getting a lot of Facebook messages from even their friends and stuff, and I was like, \u201cThis is getting a bit out of hand. I can\u2019t really manage this, like, as it is so I\u2019m just gonna create an online store.\u201d So I literally just googled, like, e-commerce software, read a few different reviews, decided go with Shopify, and created my store. I think it took me about eight hours to create the store with a blog and some information pages, like, on the ingredients and their effects, and just put our single product up to begin with, which was the 14-day teatox, and started selling from there.", "Nathan: Gotcha. And you\u2019ve done multiple extremely successful e-commerce brands. Can you tell us how far you took SkinnyMe Tea, and, yeah, let\u2019s really talk about\u2026because we\u2019re gonna get more into influencer marketing, how you\u2019ve done it, which I think is really, really key because it seems to be a recurring theme across all of your brands that you\u2019ve scaled to multiple millions of dollars in turnover. But, yeah, how far did you take SkinnyMe Tea, and can you tell us about some of your other brands?", "Gretta: Yeah, for sure. SkinnyMe Tea grew very quickly in a\u2026kind of, it felt like an uncontrolled manner. The scariest part about the business was how quickly it was growing and not being able to fulfill orders, and running out of stock all the time, and all those kind of problems, which were good problems to have as the money was coming in. We were able to grow quite quickly. We scaled from nothing at the very start. I started SkinnyMe Tea with $23 in my bank account, so I didn\u2019t put in much money to the company basically, only for web hosting, I think. The Shopify was, like, a free trial back then, and it was just kind of to host our support email and stuff.", "So basically, we started in a pre-sale model. So I would get the orders during the week while I was at work, and then I\u2019d fulfill them on the weekend, and then send them out, which meant that we were always cash-flow positive, like we were always getting money before we had to spend money. So that was kind of how we started out. And we scaled from there really quickly. In the first six months, we were doing over 600,000 USD a month, and I started to realize how much money the company was making, and how I kinda needed to start to focus on that more so because I was still working at my full-time job at the time for the first, like, two to three months. And it just kinda took that realization from when we went from\u2026like, I was making with the tea company my daily wage in an hour, or my weekly wage in an hour, and then I was making my monthly wage in an hour sometimes, and I was like, \u201cOkay, this is really something that I need to focus on.\u201d", "So I quit my job without telling anybody. I asked for some advice from friends and family, and everybody said, \u201cDo not quit your job.\u201d So I just didn\u2019t tell anybody, and quit anyway, and told them after the fact. And I think I was more scared that I wouldn\u2019t have enough to do in a day, which seems insane now. I\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, but I kind of have been getting all this done, you know. In the meantime, what if I just, like, sleep all day, or something? I don\u2019t know. Like, be on, you know, constant holiday,\u201d which was the biggest misconception I\u2019ve ever had. Like, the more work you do, the more you\u2019ve realized that you have to do.", "Nathan: Yeah, that\u2019s crazy. So you\u2019ve taken that business, turn it into multiples of millions, and that wasn\u2019t enough though. You started\u2026", "Gretta: Apparently not.", "Nathan: \u2026three more brands that are killing it. Can you tell us just about them, and we\u2019re gonna talk about the key pieces? You\u2019ve got over 17 million followers on Instagram, social media, you know, the queen of Instagram, absolutely crushing it. We talked about that last time you came on, but I\u2019m really wanna hone in on influencer marketing and how you\u2019ve done it because this is really, really key, and now, you\u2019re moving on to building a SaaS platform, which we\u2019re gonna talk about as well, which I\u2019m really curious about.", "Gretta: Well, influencer marketing, I guess, is how I built those 17 million ", "Instagram followers", ". But going back to the previous question, the next brand that I helped co-create with my co-founder was The Fifth Watches, and basically, we\u2019re a watch company that is exclusive by time rather than by price. So we only sell on the 5th of each month, for five days. That was kind of our points of difference. So each month, we\u2019d kind of spend the five days of the month focusing on sales, and then 25 days of the month, we get to focus on, you know, customer satisfaction, and building demand, and exclusivity, and growth through that means, which is quite unusual for a brand.", "Nathan: Yeah, I see. And when it comes to just, operationally, your company, is it difficult because you\u2019re running, like, a launch pretty much every single month, or is it fairly standardized across the operation site?", "Gretta: It was really difficult, to begin with, the first, you know, maybe\u2026it\u2019s been running for over two years now though. So at first, maybe 5 to 10 launches were always the most difficult because we didn\u2019t really have our progresses locked down very well. We\u2019d just be, like, a lot of moving parts at the same time, and just having to act very, very quickly to keep up with this . And, of course, it still always is, something always changes every month, but basically, the hardest part about the model is keeping that demand going each month, which is mostly through communications, and, of course, you know.", "Nathan: Yeah, got you. No, I think that model was genius just around the scarcity-based selling, and then also using it as a form of, as you call, UVP.", "Gretta: Well, it was kind of a bit of an accident to begin with. What happened was we had generated a sign-up list of about 8000 people before launch, and we only had about 1200 timepieces to sell. So what happened was we launched and we basically sold out of most of the styles within the first day of launching, and we actually did over $100,000 in that single day of sales on our first-ever day. So that was really, really exciting, and it was also my co-founder\u2019s birthday that day so he was having the best day of his life, which was amazing. And it was his first business so it was just awesome to get to experience that with him.", "Yeah, so basically, we sold out more like we don\u2019t want to be coming in and out of stock all the time. As we grow, we can\u2019t afford right now because watches are quite an expensive per-unit cost product. We\u2019re like, we can\u2019t afford, we don\u2019t wanna put in, like, a lot of capital into something we don\u2019t know will continue to succeed so we\u2019re just going to grow as we do. And we\u2019ve realized that by limiting that to the five days a month and saying, or until sold-out previously, we could kind of grow and use that\u2026like, usually, that would be a pain point, like running in and out of stock or running out of product, that we decided that we\u2019d harness this way to use that to our advantage. So rather than saying, like, \u201cOops, we\u2019re out of stock. Sorry for the inconvenience,\u201d it was more like, \u201cYes, we are out of stock. We\u2019re transparent about this. We only have limited numbers of stock, and you need to get in quickly.\u201d", "And that worked really, really well because for the first, like, six months of sales, we were selling out really, really quickly, sometimes within a few hours, which meant that also, we were building this incredibly loyal customer base because those people that were buying literally stayed up until midnight, Australian time, or got up at, like, 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. around the world to shop at our store at that time. So these people are highly-motivated buyers, and we had great retention from those as well.", "Nathan: You know, I think it\u2019s absolutely genius, kind of like what Adidas do with the Yeezys, you know, Kanye shoes, or you\u2019re just so rare and you just want\u2026", "Gretta: Yeah.", "Nathan: Yeah, gotcha. So what happened next? That wasn\u2019t enough. You started some other companies, too, right?", "Gretta: Yeah. Well, then I was working on Nichify at the same time, which is now our product, Hey, still owned by the Nichify Company Group. But, yeah, Hey is the influencer marketing product, and we\u2019re working on that because digital products, like, physical products take a lot less time than a digital product to develop. So we had to develop all that software, so that was kind of behind the scenes, working at the same time as we built that.", "And we launched another company called Drop Bottle, and that company was a bit different. So we launched Drop Bottle off the back of an audience rather than developing that audience for the product, so it was kind of a reverse launch. Like, people talk about product market fit, I kind of have a bit of a semantic problem with that term, I guess. I prefer to think of it as market product fit because if you launch a product to no audience, you know, it\u2019s not really going to develop into a brand or anything sustainable. You know, you\u2019re not going to get the sales that you thought you were. You\u2019re going to be, you know, quite disappointed. So the idea that you develop the market before or at the exact same time as your product right along the way as you\u2019re building it, is just a much better concept in my eyes. So Drop Bottle was the perfect example of market product fit where I developed a really engaged Instagram community around the concept of detox waters, so basically just water that you infuse with fruit. You get some of the added benefits from the fruit, and it\u2019s just a really kind of fun, tasty way to stay hydrated, I guess.", "And so I had this community that had about 900,000 followers on Instagram, and it was really engaged, and just a lot of comments, as well as, like, engagement so we could tell that people were really identifying with the concept. So we were like, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ve got this really engaged audience. Like, what product can we offer them?\u201d So we decided to create a detox water drink bottle, so a fruit or tea-infuser drink model that\u2019s also quite fashionable. Glass, double-walled glass, and, like, the gold lid has been the most popular. So it\u2019s kind of like a fashionable and functional drink bottle. And we also give a percentage of sales of that bottle to help make fresh water initiatives around the world. Recently built a well in Uganda, I think it was.", "Nathan: Yeah, wow! That\u2019s awesome. Why did you decide to do that?", "Gretta: I have always been interested in developing socially-conscious brands, whether that\u2019s\u2026usually, it\u2019s just behind the scenes, and it\u2019s just, you know, things like going with a more ethical supplier or sustainable kind of product parts, and you don\u2019t often get to celebrate that as much, but I think that, you know, kind of having that social conscious image at the forefront of your brand kinda develops a different relationship with your customer, and, you know, it helps the discourse of your brand in general, like you can talk about completely different issues-based topics rather than just the general, you know, functionality of the product and the effects of lemon water on your body. Like, it just lets you participate in a completely different conversation and paradigm to which you would generally be able to participate.", "Nathan: Yeah, I think that\u2019s really smart. And you can build, like, a stronger relationship with that person as well.", "Gretta: Yeah, exactly. And I think my parents really inspired that in me. They\u2019re both social workers so I grew up in quite a socially-minded family. Like, as a five-year-old, my Christmas dream was for this one politician, I won\u2019t mention his name, I\u2019m actually now friends with him, to have something dropped on the roof of his house to make him a nice person, this special magic crane. And I told him this, and this is how we actually became friends, because we sat down next to each other at a dinner, the Pitcher Partners, and I sat down next to him and I was like, \u201cYou almost shut my primary school, and my dream as a five-year-old was for you to become a good person,\u201d and he was like, \u201cWhoa! Okay.\u201d", "Nathan: Wow! That\u2019s so funny. I hear the craziest stories\u2026", "Gretta: So, yeah, I came from a bit of a kind of a left-wing, very socially-minded background where my parents both work in government roles as well. So I\u2019ve always been brought up in that way. Like when we started SkinnyMe Tea, I always tried to give back as much as possible as well. So we\u2019ve given\u2026we had a charity gala for the Kids\u2019 Cancer Project, and donated $25,000 from that night to the Kids\u2019 Cancer Project, and just a few other little things.", "My mom always comes across, like, little initiatives that you can do that are a bit more behind the scenes. Like when we first started SkinnyMe Tea, a girl needed a really expensive wheelchair, and I think it was about $16,000, and there was no way her family would have been able to afford that, but she couldn\u2019t even go to primary school without the new chair because she was in too much pain from sitting in the normal chair each day. And so, you know, we were able to donate that on the company\u2019s behalf, and just little things like that that make you kind of feel like you\u2019re doing some social good at the same time. I mean, all of the companies do have\u2026like SkinnyMe Tea even, like we\u2019ve helped so many people achieve their health goals, and we constantly get incredible feedback and reviews of people saying like, \u201cI was, you know, so out of shape before I started this, and it\u2019s really helped me turn around my whole headset about health. And, you know, I was very overweight. Now, I\u2019ve lost\u2026you know, the tea helped me kick-start losing about 20 kilos,\u201d and things like that. Like, we get some incredible stories, so the products are often rewarding in themselves, but then it\u2019s also nice to give back where possible as well.", "Nathan: Yeah. Yeah, it is great. I agree, and I wanna do more of that kind of stuff with Foundr. We did it with our book. We gave a significant amount of money to this cause that helped people obtain, you know, fresh meals in South Africa. You know, I think it\u2019s really, really good to do that kinda stuff, especially when you have the, I guess, responsibility once you build up a brand, or you build up a presence, or your company is doing okay for itself. I think that\u2019s important.", "Gretta: Yeah, of course.", "Nathan: So that wasn\u2019t enough though. You did wanna build a SaaS-based product, and it\u2019s actually a platform, as well, so it\u2019s a end-to-end marketplace. So talk to us about that because the recurring theme, you know, with you and these brands is you have a repeatable framework that\u2019s proven, and you\u2019re actually working with us at Foundr to work on actually teaching that. It\u2019s gonna be our first course. We\u2019re not gonna talk about that. We\u2019ve got tons of stuff coming out around that, but, you know, a recurring theme has been this influencer marketing piece, and you\u2019ve created a platform because that platform that you wanted to use didn\u2019t exist.", "Gretta: Yeah, basically. Like you said, it has been a repeatable kind of formula. An integral, like, central to that formula has been influencer marketing every time, and it\u2019s probably then the topic that I\u2019ve got the most questions about while I\u2019ve been growing the businesses. I\u2019ll chat later a little bit with you about, like, some of the case studies which our company is, like, launching The Fifth or when we discovered how powerful influencer marketing was with SkinnyMe Tea. But basically being able to create a platform that automates a lot of that process has just been really helpful because it\u2019s a really difficult area to kinda just explain. Like, I was finding it really difficult, if I was doing consulting or advisory, to be able to advise on every area because it\u2019s, in some ways, it\u2019s quite simple, and others, it\u2019s very complex. So it\u2019s kind of, the great thing about Hey is that it can take you from, you know, the most simple kind of campaign where you\u2019re simply reaching out to an influencer, offering your product in return for content or a post, through to much more complex situations like offering affiliate commissions of products or revenue share.", "So that\u2019s kind of the way that the platform came to be. It was just basically a pain point in the market, and, again, just scratching an itch because it was something that I needed for my influencer managers to help them do their jobs better and to help me do my job better just by automating some of the manual processes that we have to go through, but the main thing was just kind of\u2026it was centralizing that communication. Influencer marketing is very relationships-based and it\u2019s very communication-driven, and by creating an end-to-end platform where you can go in, start a campaign, and finish it with a payment, and be submitted the work to review and those metrics to track all in the one platform was just the most helpful part because everybody knows, that has started an influencer marketing campaign without using a platform, that just the communication becomes very decentralized very quickly. You\u2019re communicating across multiple platforms like email, or Facebook, text messaging, WhatsApp, and it quickly gets out of control, and just a lot of Excel spreadsheets. And I just thought, like, \u201cThis is not the way that I want my team operating. This is not the way that I want to be doing this, and there\u2019s got to be a simpler way.\u201d", "So we kind of started working with developers to get those concepts and what I did kind of every day out of my head into a platform that other people could use and be scalable. So it was kind of a way of scaling my knowledge into a platform that could help other brands grow in the same way that we had.", "Nathan: So why is influencer marketing so key now if you do have any kind of brand? Because we\u2019ve done it at Foundr and we\u2019ve done it, like, reasonably well as well, nowhere near to the scale that you guys have done it, but it\u2019s been incredibly key for us, you know, to build our social, yeah.", "Gretta: No, it\u2019s just a different market. I think you guys have done a really great job with influencer marketing. Just I think, like, the main importance is that constantly,\u00a0 the trust of a consumer for a brand is decreasing over time. Brands used to be more of a trusted authority point for a consumer, and now, consumers kind of are feeling disillusioned by a lot of brand history. So I think, like, the main importance of influencer marketing is that influencers not only have an audience\u2019s attention, but they also have that audience\u2019s trust. And so it\u2019s kind of that trust component that makes influencer marketing so important, and that makes it so effective as well. So I think, like, the main importance of influencer marketing is how effective it is on your company\u2019s bottom line. It\u2019s the most effective digital marketing technique that there is right now in terms of ROI.", "Nathan: Yeah, wow! That\u2019s a big claim. Like, how do you measure ROI? That\u2019s something that comes up a lot.", "Gretta: Well, there are a lot of kind of different ways to measure social ROI. It depends what your goals basically are, and whether those goals are kind of more follower and social-growth-based or sales-based, and you can track and manage both of those. A tool that we\u2019re building into Hey right now for our follower-based campaign is the ability to track, follow a growth based off the new followers that you gained after an influencer\u2019s post that used to be their followers and are now your followers. So basically, the algorithm would do their followers minus your followers equals followers gained. So you can see that you, like, have gained 56 followers of one influencer post and 1020 of another, and that just makes it very, very clear that the ROI, in terms of social growth, was much higher for one influencer than another. And often, you might be really surprised by the influencers, we find, especially for micro influencers, because they have that higher level of trust and because their feeds aren\u2019t as saturated with branded content that sometimes, they provide really surprising results. So it\u2019s just great to have that tool there to track.", "Nathan: Yeah, no, that part alone is just game-changing. I\u2019ve never found a tool that can actually do that, which\u2026just even that part alone doesn\u2019t exist right now in the marketplace, correct?", "Gretta: No, no. I just use a spreadsheet tool that does it based off, like, a code right now, and it\u2019s really hideous, so it\u2019ll be good to have it, you know, put into our beautiful books , which is kind of one of the things we\u2019ve prided ourselves on for this version of the product. It\u2019s just a really simple, straightforward UX.", "Nathan: Yeah, gotcha. So if you ever wanna know more about how to use influencer marketing to grow their brand, to grow their business, is it B2C mainly, or can B2B do it? Love to hear your thoughts there.", "Gretta: Yeah. I think that basically, it\u2019s going to usually be more effective. It just depends on the audience of the influencer. Basically, like, an influencer is someone that has an audience\u2019s attention, basically, and can influence their audience on a brand\u2019s behalf to buy the products they recommend. So if that audience happens to have a lot more business owners in it, like Saunders, for example, then that\u2019s when you\u2019re an influential body or you\u2019re an influencer in the B2B network. And we are looking to integrate LinkedIn to Hey as well so that we can harness kind of that more B2B aspect, too, with the LinkedIn influencers.", "Nathan: Yeah, that would be really, really smart, because there are people like in the B2B space that have big followings around, you know, SaaS, or big followings around ", "consulting", " or\u2026you know, like Richard Branson, I don\u2019t know if you\u2026do you think that you would get business leaders to connect to the platform, to do influence deals?", "Gretta: Yeah. I think that we mostly implement our kind of more code marketing aspect, that\u2019s when that will come in a lot more. So basically the point of difference for Hey to other platforms in the market, I think, like I\u2019m in kind of a bit of a unique position to comment on influencer marketing in that I\u2019ve been on the brand side representing my brands, and also having those 17 million Instagram followers. I\u2019ve been on the influencer side before, so I can kind of understand the pain points and complexities from both sides of the market, and the main thing that I\u2019ve noticed that is lacking in the market right now is the understanding that influencer marketing is a multi-directional relationship. It\u2019s not just a brand sending an influencer a brief and saying, \u201cThis is what you need to do.\u201d Like, there needs to be the component for an influencer to be able to pitch to a brand, and then also for multiple influencers, or like maybe a bit of a kind of content crew, like, you know, \u201cThis is our hairstylist, this is our makeup artist, this is our photographer, this is the model, blah-blah-blah, this is our videographer,\u201d to be able to then go pitch their creative concept to a brand.", "And then, also, the next stage of the product is then multiple brands being able to collaborate on a single campaign, so, say, there\u2019s a lot of brands that are often identified with other brands, or where competition isn\u2019t going to be an issue, I\u2019ve always been a lot more into collaboration over competition. So it\u2019s that kind of collaborative aspect that a frank body, like my sister\u2019s company, could team up with the SkinnyMe Tea because we have really similar audiences, but it wouldn\u2019t be detracting from either company\u2019s sales, and we could split the cost of that influencer marketing campaign. We could say, as long as\u2026you know, like, if you\u2019re doing a body scrub, that\u2019s quite detoxifying for your skin, and if you\u2019re drinking a detox tea at the same time, that wouldn\u2019t be an unusual thing to happen. People often use our products side-by-side, so why not team up to create that content at scale at half the price?", "So it\u2019s multiple brands being able to team up like that, like a sunglasses company and a T-shirt company. The opportunity is kind of endless in that way. So I think it\u2019s like connecting brands to collaborate, brand to brand, at the same time as connecting influencers to collaborate with brands, brands to collaborate with influencers, but then, also, the next step after that is the influencer-to-influencer collaborations. So it\u2019s the fact that you need to constantly be focusing on your growth as an influencer, and you should be spending 80% of your time as an influencer focusing on your organic engagement and 20% focusing on your branded content. So that 80% of your time can be spent collaborating with other influencers that are around the same size as you and around the same breach.", "So we\u2019ve already got this platform with, like, highly-engaged influencers to be able to connect those influencers, to collaborate at the same time to help grow their social accounts, also to help show them, like, e-metrics and data based off the other tool that we\u2019re implementing with the tracking of followers. How that\u2019s fairing for them will be really, really important. So it\u2019s connecting this market in multiple directions.", "Nathan: That\u2019s fascinating, yeah, because as influencers, like, you know, you see all the YouTubers, they all collaborate, like they\u2019re all from LA, they\u2019re all getting in each other\u2019s videos, they\u2019re all collaborating. They don\u2019t see\u00a0 each other\u2019s competition. Yeah, same thing.", "Gretta: Yeah, which is great, and it\u2019s like fashion bloggers that hold those giveaways where you have to follow one of them, and then you follow the next one, and the next one, and the next one. On Instagram, for example, they\u2019ll be giving away a Gucci bag or something like that, and they all collaborate together, maybe like five of them, and share each other\u2019s reach in that way.", "Nathan: So talk to me, let\u2019s say you have a physical-product business or, you know, you have a digital product, but generally physical product, let\u2019s go for physical product\u2026", "Gretta: Yeah, let\u2019s go for physical now.", "Nathan: Let\u2019s go for physical. Do you pay an influencer or do you just send them the product for free?", "Gretta: That\u2019s kind of the bind right now. There is the product for post-campaign, which is really beneficial in terms of the influencers that you\u2019re going to get to apply to that campaign really are just interested in your product and want to post on your company. The issue with that campaign is influencers may not always post on your product once you\u2019ve sent them, whereas if you pay them it\u2019s a business relationship. If you\u2019ve only sent them a product, it\u2019s kind of hard to follow up in any kind of meaningful way. You can\u2019t say, like, \u201cI sent you this, you might hate it, and you need to post on it now.\u201d That\u2019s the really important part, too. Like, whenever you\u2019re doing an influencer marketing campaign, it\u2019s important that the influencer really does care about your product and it does resonate with them, so you kind of need to find that. Like, influencers should be turning down campaigns from brands, even if they\u2019re paid, if they don\u2019t identify with that product or it doesn\u2019t align with their values.", "And that\u2019s what we separate, like, the influencers that are actually influential from just people with a large social reach. So once influencers start to post multiple products, like if they\u2019re posting five watch companies within five days, or if they\u2019re posting, you know, three different tea companies in a week saying that they\u2019re doing all of their \u201cteatoxes,\u201d it\u2019s just not realistic, and it\u2019s kind of keeping that authentic relationship with the brand at the forefront.", "So for the product, for best-paid campaigns, I\u2019d say often paying them is going to be less work in the long run, product-for-post is a lot of relationship management. You need to stay in constant contact with the influencer making sure you know they\u2019ve received the product, that they\u2019re happy with it, that they know how to use it. And that\u2019s all normal, but you shouldn\u2019t have to get to the point where, you know, you\u2019re following up whether they\u2019ve posted for you or not, and a paid campaign kind of just takes that element out of it. It\u2019s just going to be a lot easier to follow up, and that relationship can be more ongoing.", "Usually, for product-for-post, you\u2019re only gonna get one post from the influencer on the product, which may not be enough to nurture their audience or educate them on the product. So you might want to enter into more of a paid campaign where you set up three posts that are kind of like your nurturing email series, like a drink , like, \u201cWelcome to the product,\u201d and then, \u201cHere are some of its benefits, and here are my results,\u201d often like three really good steps to kind of go through for the product. You know, it might be like the unboxing, and like the excitement of initially receiving your watch, and then like the benefits of the watch, like, I\u2019ve been getting so many compliments on it. It\u2019s like I haven\u2019t taken it off. That\u2019s like an average kind of three-step campaign for an influencer, and I just think that a lot of influencers also will only accept paid campaigns, and they might be even more professional influencers. But at the same time, a product-for-post campaign is a lot better if they\u2019re a micro influencer, whereas paid campaigns are better for those macro, larger-audience influencers.", "Nathan: Hey, guys. I just wanted to take a second to let you know about today\u2019s sponsor of this episode.

And you said the micro influencers, the ones that, you know, might be just starting to get a following. Are they the ones that you really want to tap into, where they\u2019re following is quite big, they\u2019re not doing that much posting, they\u2019ve got a reasonable, like, a really, really strong deep trust with their audience the most? Or have you seen results with really, really big ones, too, like maybe a Kylie Jenner? I\u2019m really curious on that.", "Gretta: Yeah. I think that a lot of people speak about their really high results with macro influencers like Kylie Jenner, like, \u201cOh, we sold out,\u201d but they may have only had, like, 50 units in stock to sell out, and a post with Kylie Jenner cost $300,000. I haven\u2019t heard one brand actually regenerate all of the sales they spent on that one post with a macro influencer like a Kylie Jenner. So, like, the celebrity as an influencer side isn\u2019t often going to work unless you have, like, a personal relationship with that influencer, which is very unusual. Like, if Kylie Jenner happened to be, like, your cousin\u2019s best friend, then, great, go for it. But the great part about macro influencers is macro influencers influence your micro influencers, so it\u2019s more that the macro will influence the other influencers that you might want to work with.", "So often, there\u2019s a macro influencer of a market. So, say, Sydney foodies, the macro influencer of that market might be Li-Chi Pan, for example, who has a much, you know, a higher following. I think she\u2019s got, like, over 500,000 followers, very engaged, and every Sydney foodie knows that Li-Chi Pan is kind of like a go-to person in terms of content-styling, audience engagement. So if you do engage a macro influencer, you can use that as leverage to engage your micro influencers, plus your micro influencers will have had exposure to your brand through seeing it on Li-Chi\u2019s feed. So you\u2019re much more likely to then be able to pursue them for just a product-for-post or a cheaper post than usual. So I often just use macro influencers to influence your micro influencers, and micro influencers influence your customers.", "Nathan: Gotcha.", "Gretta: So the micro influencers will influence kind of like your user-generated content. So a great way to kind of get users and your customers to create the images they want is by using those micro influencers for constant content generation, and then your customer will use that as inspiration to then create content based off that.", "Nathan: Yeah, because UGC is so key. Like, as a great way to sell, you need to have influencers. You need to have everyday people, like me or you, using the product because that\u2019s what people relate to the most.", "Gretta: Yeah, because that\u2019s the real results in reviews. People are increasingly understanding that influencers are paid or influencers were given that product. So it\u2019s an influencer\u2019s job now to stay as authentic, and real, and organic with their audience as possible, and knows their role, and it is a brand\u2019s job to allow that influencer to kind of propagate their creative. Like, you should not be saying, \u201cPost this with these exact words,\u201d or\u2026like, it\u2019s really unfair on the influencer and it\u2019s not going to have good results for your brand. An influencer knows their audience.", "Nathan: Can you give us some case studies, just to wrap it back, so like some things that you\u2019ve done with your brands?", "Gretta: Yeah. Well, for The Fifth, for example, we were lucky enough to have 30 sample pieces, timepieces, to send out to kind of some key influencers in our market before launch. And we sent those to a few kind of macro influencers that had larger audiences, that we already had good relationships with, but it was, again, unpaid.", "Nathan: On Instagram and YouTube? Sorry to interrupt. Instagram\u2026", "Gretta: Just Instagram at that stage. Now, we use a lot more YouTube, but at the time, it was just influencers on Instagram, and mostly micro influencers for content. So we would have sent out about 10 to influencers with maybe over 100,000 followers, and 20 to influencers with under 50,000 followers, and those influencers with under 50K were able to generate awesome content, or some branded content for us to start seeing and using to generate demand around the product. And that resulted in our amazing first day of sales because at the same time, we were very cognizant of the fact that social followers are traffic at the same time, but the best kind of conversion that you can get without it being a sales conversion is a sign-up via email.", "So at the same time, all of our influencers were pushing their followers to sign up to our wait list, at the same. Like, that was their general call to action, and that was our call to action on all of our posts. It was kind of like, \u201cWe\u2019re launching soon. Sign up,\u201d you know, \u201cand we\u2019ll let you know when we launch.\u201d And so then we were able to kind of garner about 8000 really, really qualified leads because obviously, as we sold out, and we only had a thousand timepieces, you know, that\u2019s a really, really high conversion rate, one out of that, to buy off a waitlist. Usually, I\u2019d say it\u2019s 1 to 20 or even potentially 1 to 40 off a waitlist. So we were able to kind of generate those qualified leads.", "And the great thing about influencer marketing as well is that studies have shown that influencer marketing leads to 37% higher retention rate of customers at the same time. So because those leads are more qualified, because they already have that identifiable kind of feeling towards your brand, when they\u2019re signing up, they can remember kind of why they signed up in the first place, or which image, you know, resulted in that sign-up, and so then they identify that with your brand on a more ongoing kind of basis because they\u2019ve got that emotional attachment as well to your product. So basically, sending out to those 30 influencers before launch was the only marketing we did, and we did $100,000 in sales. We didn\u2019t do any Facebook ads. The only marketing was gathering those emails, and then just sending out an email saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve now launched.\u201d \u201cWell, we have, like, five hours to go,\u201d and then the launch email.", "Nathan: Yeah, wow! That\u2019s crazy. What about\u2026", "Gretta: The ROI, and that was\u00a0 paid. Well, with SkinnyMe Tea, to begin with, it was really interesting because it was back in 2012 that we discovered kind of the effectiveness of influencer marketing. And back then, brands basically would not influence their marketing on Instagram. It wasn\u2019t a known kind of thing. Like, brands had done it on YouTube, and stuff before, but it still wasn\u2019t even given that kind of term or name as an influencer at that stage. So in 2012, an influencer maybe had, like, a thousand followers on Instagram, which just shows the scale now. So 1000 would have been relevant to, like, 50,000 followers now.", "So what happened was a girl from Tasmania bought our tea just because she was interested in it and I\u2019d been engaging with her a bit on social as well, answering some questions, and we followed her and would like her photos and stuff to stay engaged. And so she purchased our tea, and because I was, like, all over the brand, I was involved in every single little part because I was an obsessive freak. Yes, I was pretty special. I wouldn\u2019t even let anybody touch the customer service for the first six months. I was on customer service, like, eight hours a day responding to every email because I thought that it made me a bad founder if I let anybody else do anything. So that was\u2026", "Nathan: Just a lesson.", "Gretta: \u2026a little bit silly. Yeah, really good lesson. I\u2019ve definitely learned delegation now, because I\u2019m on top of the brand. Like, one of the main things in the setup is to kind of track where your growth is coming from, and, you know, we all know that. If you don\u2019t know how you\u2019re growing, then there\u2019s no way to replicate that from there. So basically, I saw that this girl had posted on us, and then we had our best day of sales ever that day, and we made over $1000 in that day of sales, and we\u2019d never done that before, like, we cracked that kind of number. This was, I think, in the first month. Yeah, must have been just like a couple of weeks in, or something actually.", "And so then when I was going through Instagram all the time, because I would go through and follow and unfollow the community, like I kind of spoke about in my first podcast with you guys, like how we kind of, you know did\u00a0 scale to scale our community, like just manually going through, and following and unfollowing, doing all those kind of processes that automated now. But, yes, so every time I\u2019d see somebody that fit our audience and demographic, like a young health-conscious female with over a thousand followers, and who was out of high school, too, was one of my criteria because you had to be over 18, every time I\u2019d see them, I\u2019d screenshot them and I\u2019d reach out to them on Instagram. There was no direct messaging them, so I\u2019d just literally just write in a comment, like, \u201cI\u2019d love, you know, to grab your email and send you some tea,\u201d and the response rate was huge then. Like, I\u2019d said 90% to 95% of people would respond saying they\u2019d love to.", "So it\u2019s really different to now that all different companies are kind of involved, and there might be like\u2026there\u2019s like 200 different \u201cteatox\u201d companies now, whereas then, there was only us. So, like, you\u2019re competing against that market at the same time, and, like your question earlier about paid versus product-for-post, if there\u2019s 200 different tea companies, and they\u2019re all paying people, and you just send someone your product, it\u2019s not going to work, unfortunately, anymore. So, like, it\u2019s quite unusual. It will be dependent upon your product. If it\u2019s a fashion item, for example, and it\u2019s quite unusual, and there\u2019s not that many other brands doing exactly what you\u2019re doing, that might get away more with the product, suppose, that now, payment is becoming more and more of an expectation, and that\u2019s completely fair as well.", "Influencers do do more than just posting something to their feed. Like, a lot of them are incredible content creators that have to take that photo on, you know, their camera, and then spend, like, an hour editing it as well. And so it must be hugely disappointing if that post was not paid for because you\u2019ve spent hours of your life generating that content, and then promoting that to your audience that you have, again, spent hours now, with maybe 80% of your time, like I spoke of before, keeping that audience happy, generating content for them, engaging with them, answering their questions. Those are owned assets, and that makes complete sense if somebody should pay for an owned asset.", "Nathan: But how do you know how much to pay? That\u2019s a scary thing, right?", "Gretta: Yeah. I think that the industry is still like, as with any starting-out industry, there\u2019s going to be different ways to value content. I know that a lot of big influencer agencies use all different techniques to value their audience, so it might be based on conversions. Some people might pay based on conversions, like a percentage of that conversion, which is also difficult though because how long would that, you know, last for? Because it could take three months for that customer to finally convert when they\u2019ve followed you from another influencer\u2019s page. So that is one way to stretch the value, but usually, it\u2019s just payment per post.", "And once you start working with different influencers, you can kind of get the general idea of how much payment the post might be. Like, under 20,000 followers might be $50 to $100 a post. Fifty thousand followers might be kind of close of $100 to $200 a post. A hundred thousand plus could be $200 to $500 a post. Five hundred thousand followers plus would be over $1000 easily a post. So this kind of marking points that are there and present, and you can kind of see those based off the other influencers that you\u2019re working with. But at the same time, if an influencer had had a much more engaged community than usual, but less followers, that creates incredible content that\u2019s very obviously there, that\u2019s kind of like intellectual property at the same time. Like if an influencer has a very unusual content style that people can automatically identify with them, and they are a kind of leader in their community, then you should be willing to pay more to access that kind of influence.", "So those people that head up communities, those are perfect macro kind of influencer, like I spoke about with, like, the Sydney foodie community. There\u2019s all different communities and there\u2019s all different leaders within those, and identifying those leaders just by going and researching that community on social, and seeing, you know, who has a very engaged page, who\u2019s followed by most of the other influencers within that community, who they\u2019re mentioning, who they\u2019re re-posting, who they\u2019re hanging out with, that is kind of\u2026like, I think of a community like a cluster on Instagram, and you want to engage that cluster as a whole.", "So, say, again, even the Sidney foodie cluster, if we engage the Li-Chi Pan, a couple of bigger other macros, we\u2019d want to engage maybe like 10, 20 micros to each one macro influencer. And you might get the macro influencer to do their post first, and then that inspires the content of micro influencers, which\u2026you know, like if you\u2019re going in upwards of, like, $5,000 to $10,000 a post, it obviously makes sense that rather than just having one post by somebody with five\u2026you know, that costs $5,000 to $10,000, you can have 20 to 50 posts of micro influencers with the same reach, but entirely different ways of accessing that kind of audience and customer base. But the reason that you want clusters is because similar audiences follow the same people.", "So, like, the same\u00a0 follow those five influencers, and they will promote your product multiple times kind of in different ways of showing that content, like, each influencer creates content unique to their feed, and they\u2019ll be like, \u201cWow! Every Sydney foodie is going to this one cafe right now.\u201d Like, \u201cI need to go there. What\u2019s so special about it?\u201d Or like, \u201cEvery fashion blogger is wearing this unique jewelry company right now.\u201d Like, \u201cI need to go check out what it is.\u201d And it\u2019s kind of garnering and generating that demand through repetition, but it\u2019s not repetition in terms of, like, it\u2019s not annoying to see five times, it\u2019s not like seeing the same re-targeting ad in your Facebook feed five times and being like, \u201cI am deleting this brand,\u201d and blocking them. It\u2019s more like, \u201cWow!\u201d Like, \u201cEveryone\u2019s doing it.\u201d", "So, like, often, people say, \u201cYeah, okay, you have 17 million followers, except what\u2019s the overlap between them?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less. If it was 1 million people or 2 million people and I followed those accounts 17 different times, then I don\u2019t mind because we generate different content for all those different accounts, and we\u2019re approaching those people in 17 different ways, and kind of the more that you\u2019re able to nurture them from all different angles, all different ways, with all different kind of value propositions is the way that your influencer marketing is going to convert the best.\u201d", "Nathan: You know, that\u2019s gold, channeling some real inner wisdom there. Okay.", "Gretta: I get a bit passionate about some of these things.", "Nathan: No, it\u2019s awesome. No, this is great. We have to work towards wrapping up, but I have a couple of more questions. Is there a law of diminishing returns? Can you find\u2026like, let\u2019s say you use one influencer, you track it with Hey, you know, you\u2019re getting a really good ROI, and then you just wanna keep going. Is there a law of diminishing returns where eventually, your ROI becomes less and less, and eventually, it doesn\u2019t work anymore?", "Gretta: Yeah, definitely. That would be quite transparent in our data as well. So that\u2019s one of the great things. You can kind of see the point where that\u2019s starting to drop off a lot, and you might want to think about approaching a different influencer to work with at that stage, and just pausing that for a little bit as well. If you pause a campaign and come back to it with an influencer later once they\u2019ve got, you know, kind of some fresh new followers, and it\u2019s not as repetitive within the one feed\u2026like it\u2019s great to have products that are repetitive throughout different feeds, but you don\u2019t want them posting, like, your watch every single day. People will become sick of that. They\u2019ll unfollow the influencer, which is bad for them, and, you know, they\u2019ll build up that kind of resentment towards your brand, which is the last thing that you want. So there\u2019s definitely diminishing returns, and there\u2019s also diminishing returns with influencer as a whole for any product.", "So the reason that micro influencers are so much more effective than a macro influencer in terms of ROI as well is because often, those micro influencers, their feeds are so much more fresh. They\u2019re like gems. If you can find those little micro influencers that are growing really quickly and have hardly posted, like, much other branded content, and you work with them until the returns are diminishing a lot more, like, that will be very obvious based just around metrics, so the measurement things like whether you\u2019re getting as many followers, if you\u2019re using, you know, discount codes, for example, like Daniel Wellington does really well, they\u2019ll do an influencer\u2019s name like \u201cGretta 10,\u201d and that means you get 10% off by using that discount code, and that makes it quite trackable as well.", "But then there\u2019s other brands that are, like, more affiliate and more referral software where they can track things like cookies, like where that person clicked from in the first place, to then be able to identify that sale back to the influencer, or there\u2019s different brands like, I think, it\u2019s Olapic, it\u2019s called, where it creates kind of like a shoppable feed on your Instagram, and the last influencer photo that that person has clicked the sale is attributed to them. That, I don\u2019t really find that that helpful because, you know, they might have clicked three different ones and then being like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen enough, that\u2019s okay,\u201d not being like, \u201cOh, this photo made me buy the watch.\u201d", "Nathan: Yeah, I was just about to say I\u2019m not a big fan of shoppable feeds. I guess, yeah, I\u2019m not, yeah.", "Gretta: They can be helpful. I mean, they work really well for, like, a lot of fashion brands where people just want to know what products are featured in that photo, because they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I wanna buy that top,\u201d you know, \u201cnot the shorts, not the jewelry, you know, not the hat. I just wanna buy that top.\u201d And they can go and find that there. So, like, relevance-wise, that\u2019s okay, and it\u2019s a good way of kinda connecting that digital social experience into your website experience as well, I guess, but I don\u2019t think it would work as well for, like, a brand like yours, for example, with Foundr, at all. Like, we clicked this quote, and then I wanted to do the course.", "Nathan: Yeah, right. Yeah, I won\u2019t get a value there, yeah, yeah.", "Gretta: It\u2019s not the exact same thing, yes.", "Nathan: No, that makes sense. Yeah, so let\u2019s work towards wrapping up. You\u2019ve channeled a lot of wisdom, shared a lot of gold with us around influencer marketing, e-commerce, branding, you name it. So this is, as mentioned, like, you do\u2026we have been able to twist your arm to actually teach an e-commerce course, which I\u2019m really, really excited about, and team up with us, and it\u2019s gonna be absolutely crazy. But we\u2019ll let you know, for everyone listening, how you can find out more about that. And if you wanna find out more about Hey, how can you find out more?", "Gretta: Well, in the e-commerce course, I do a dedicated lesson on influencer marketing as an intro to influencer marketing, and then I do another dedicated lesson on how to scale your influencer marketing using Hey specifically as a tool. And I think maybe we haven\u2019t quite gone through exactly what Hey does yet during this. So basically, Hey is an end-to-end collaboration platform that allows you, as a brand, to collaborate with influencers across different demographics, and search and filter influencers by demographics.", "So it\u2019s finding that right fit for an influencer, but it\u2019s campaign-based at the same time. And our campaigns are template, so basically, you go in, you select the goal for your campaign, so that might be followers, like we\u2019ve spoken about, it might be sales, or it might be content, might be a pre-launch, and you just need a lot of content for your brand. So basically, you go in, you create this campaign with the goals, we help guide you through those stages, which is really helpful for people that haven\u2019t really done influencer marketing before, or even people that have that forget to be goals-driven, which is often the case. I sometimes just run a campaign and be like, \u201cWell, it\u2019s hard trap because I don\u2019t really know what I wanted, but I know that it was a good campaign because I got, you know, this miss out of it,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, that must have been my goal.\u201d", "So it\u2019s good to have that goal from the very start. So when you go in to create that campaign, you might create a content-driven campaign, and you might just want to engage micro influencers for product-for-posts. So you can select the type of campaign, like you can say, \u201cWear our stuff,\u201d or, \u201cReview a product,\u201d or, \u201cTry something on,\u201d or, \u201cGo to a restaurant, work out somewhere.\u201d There\u2019s all different types of campaigns to help you kind of like get those creative juices flowing. Like, it\u2019s always harder to start with a blank canvas. Like, we\u2019ve just added some templates so that you\u2019re kind of able to start from somewhere.", "After you\u2019ve created the campaign, it takes you through to finding your influencers, and those influencers will appear subject to the demographic data that you\u2019ve entered in the campaign, like which platform you\u2019d like to be working on, whether the influencers that you\u2019re looking for are male or female, their kind of age group, their interest groups, which is, like, that\u2019s the Nichify aspect, the niches that they interact with, so that might be health and fitness, or lifestyle and travel, or beauty, or fashion. And so once you\u2019ve selected those, then you can go on to finding the right fit of influencer for your campaign. And the cool part is, as well, that if you\u2019ve already done influencer marketing before and you already have those pre-existing relationships, Hey acts as a, I like to call it an IRM, like a CRM, customer relationship management. This is an IRM, so an influencer relationship management platform.", "So you can invite all the influencers that you\u2019ve had previous relationships with to that campaign automatically as well just by uploading a CSV or just inputting, like, the comma-separated values yourself, like the emails, and their first name, so kind of like a MailChimp, like your email-automation software. That\u2019s basically the way that you go about finding and inviting influencers to the platform, and it\u2019s called Hey because you \u201chey\u201d somebody, you click the little hand and it waves, and you\u2019ve reached out to them. And the way that Hey works is that it\u2019s kind of like a matchmaking tool in a way. It\u2019s kind of like Tinder crossed with influencer marketing because you both need to match to then go on to build that relationship together. It can\u2019t be just a brand has reached out to an influencer, and now, they\u2019re allowed to, you know, start negotiating price and value. The influencer has to have \u201cheyed\u201d a brand back. So a brand can either \u201chey\u201d an influencer or they can make that campaign public and influencers can begin \u201cheying\u201d them, which can also be kinda strategic for a brand because then you know the influencers that are interested in working with you. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve reached out this. They have kind of made the first move, so we go back to the dating kind of example.", "So then it goes into the \u201cmanage\u201d step, and you can manage the relationship, discuss the deal, set the terms. It\u2019s kind of a split screen where on the left-hand side, you\u2019re chatting with them. That\u2019s kind of like a Facebook chat. And on the right-hand side, you\u2019re setting the terms, so how much you\u2019re going to pay the influencer, which you can negotiate in the chat, and they\u2019ll be able to send you their rate card and their address card as well so that you know exactly where you\u2019re sending the product and how much they generally charge for a post or for multiple posts. So you get all that information just straight up, which is really helpful, and it\u2019s all just stored in that one centralized kind of spot. And, of course, we\u2019ll be implementing kind of new features all throughout, like daily downloadable CSVs where you can download all the shipping details from that day for the different influencers that you then need to give to, like, your third-party logistics company, or to your distribution company, or to your distribution team within your company to send out all the product for the influencers that day.", "So we\u2019re just kinda trying to make the process as simplified as possible, but at the same time, have some things in there that allow for the complexities of any relationship. So the discuss element where you can chat to an influencer is really helpful because that\u2019s where you can kind of build your relationship. And I think, like, the main two pieces of advice I\u2019d give when relationship-building with influencers is to flatter them and make them feel relevant, so like, you know, \u201cI love your feeds.\u201d You know, \u201cI love kind of the healthy lifestyle that you live, so I think that would be really, you know, relevant to our audience as well.\u201d So just having an understanding of who they are, and then that takes you to the second point which is kind of that personalization. Don\u2019t just be like, \u201cHey, insert-first-name, we\u2019d love to work with you,\u201d you know. Like, that\u2019s so transparent, and they realize that they\u2019re not, you know, kind of anything special or relevant to your brand.", "And then I\u2019d also say, as a third one, I\u2019ve just thought of, again, giving them that creative freedom to do what they do and to communicate with their audience in their language with your message. They\u2019re still able to communicate your message, but in their language, like, that\u2019s what influencers do best. So it\u2019s giving them that creative freedom to create the visuals and the text that they need. Yeah, so that\u2019s kind of the way that Hey works in a nutshell, those three steps. So you create a campaign, you find the influencers for that campaign, then you manage that relationship. And then it takes you to kind of\u2026you can confirm their post, you can give it a green light, saying, \u201cLook, I already trust your judgment. I know the type of content this creates. I know your tone of voice, and I know that you\u2019ll stick to, you know, the campaign boundaries, so I\u2019m gonna greenlight your post, and once you\u2019ve posted, it\u2019ll be\u2026I\u2019ll get a notification saying, \u2018Influencer has posted,\u2019 and the payment will automatically be released.\u201d", "The other thing is that if you haven\u2019t worked with an influencer before, and there isn\u2019t kind of that trust in pre-relationship, and their content might be a little bit all over the place, some photos are, like, kind of hideous, but then some are good, then a good way to do it is to use pre-approval. So what happens is the influencer submits the post through to you, you pre-approve that content. Once you then sent it, once you\u2019ve seen the exact caption and the image, and if their image deviates from that or if the caption deviates too far from that, we will be able to hold that payment in escrow while that dispute is resolved, so whether the influencer posts again with what they initially said, or whether the brand is refunded their money back into their account, because, A, the influencer hasn\u2019t posted all within the time frame, or B, they have posted something completely off-brand and out of line.", "That\u2019s kind of the security that Hey gives you over just interacting, like, over email, because we are able to kind of hold that payment. So that was a really big pain point for brands, like influencers going off the radar. You know, they might suddenly decide they\u2019re gonna go to Croatia for a month, or something, which actually isn\u2019t that unusual, and not post for you, and the campaign\u2019s already over, and it was a pre-launch and they\u2019ve missed it, but they won\u2019t refund your money. We\u2019ve got so many pending payments to influencers that haven\u2019t done the work for us, and there\u2019s no way to really get that money. And then from an influencer\u2019s point of view, too, brands, if they pay them over PayPal, because it\u2019s a digital transaction, there\u2019s no real way to prove that that was what was transacted.

At that point, Singal\u2019s company had more than $1 million in debt and needed help. The two friends worked out an agreement. Kim would help the company get out of debt, but in exchange, Singal would teach Kim everything he knew. As soon as the company was out of debt, Kim would move on.", "And just like that, Kim went from making around $250,000 to $300,000 a year at the dealership to about $80,000 a year at the internet marketing company.

In 2016, he estimates that business brought in $4.5 million in revenue.", "While Kim was running his internet marketing company, he and his team developed an in-house solution to their email marketing woes: Sendlane.", "\u201cWe never intended it to be anything else but for us,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the number one thing: We built it for us. It was a platform. It was ugly. It was purposeful. That was all we built it for.\u201d", "But by 2014, friends and clients alike began asking Kim where they could find out more about Sendlane. The problem was, they couldn\u2019t. All that existed was a login page for Kim\u2019s company to use to access the app. So in 2015, he and his team decided to open the doors to the public and see what happened. They put up a simple webpage with a payment portal\u2014and people started signing up. From 2015 to 2017, they ran it passively. In its first year, Sendlane reached $40,000 to $50,000 in monthly recurring revenue. By 2016, it climbed to $80,000 to $90,000 a month.", "So there Kim was, juggling his internet marketing company, a growing side business, and on top of that, a clothing store in Las Vegas.

So I had to find a good balance.\u201d", "To do that, Kim decided to sell most of his companies and revive his favorite tactic\u2014focus. He would pour his energy into one company only, and it would be Sendlane.", "\u201cI took that hard look,\u201d he says. \u201cI looked at the companies and I was like, \u2018You know, this is the company that I can see incredible legs, and I know we haven\u2019t focused on it, but look what we did without even focusing on it. What can we do by simply focusing on it?\u201d", "That was in August 2017. From September 2017 to May 2018, Sendlane grew an average of 10 percent, month over month.", "That age-old question.

He says he plans to spend the majority of the funding on growth, such as media buying and salespeople, keeping a close eye on getting an ROI as fast as possible.", "While we had his attention, of course we had to ask Kim to share some of his email marketing knowledge. The first thing Kim wants people to know, though, is that you can\u2019t use outdated tactics and expect awesome results.", "\u201cPeople are still trying to do what worked in email marketing in 2008, in 2018,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t recognize things have changed so dramatically. \u2026 People are just getting a heck of a lot more emails every day.\u201d", "In fact, a whopping 269 billion emails are sent each day, according to a ", "2017 report by research firm The Radicati Group", ". So how can you stand out in a crowded inbox? Kim recommends behavior-based automation.", "Using your email marketing platform, create emails based on actions a user took (or didn\u2019t take). Did they open your emails? Did they buy anything? What kinds of actions have they taken in the past?", "For example, if a subscriber isn\u2019t opening any of your emails, it may be time to get more aggressive. On the other hand, if a subscriber is opening all of your emails but hasn\u2019t made a purchase, that tells you they\u2019re highly engaged, but for whatever reason, they\u2019re not buying. It may be time to move that subscriber into a separate email funnel that pushes them to make a purchase.", "\u201cCreating that personalized experience is, bar none, the best way to make people want to actually listen to you and want to open your emails,\u201d Kim says. \u201cThat\u2019s email automation and that\u2019s the best way you can do it now, in 2018, and forward.\u201d", "This level of personalization can be achieved with email marketing software that allows tagging, revenue tracking, and \u201cif this, then that\u201d statements.", "\u201cThings like that you can do with email, you can do with Sendlane of course, but you can do it with most email platforms that are more advanced thinking.\u201d", "Aside from raising a round of funding later this year, Kim has an entire roadmap for Sendlane that he wants to continue to implement.", "\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you that I\u2019m not going to ever sell the company,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause if someone offers me enough money, I\u2019m going to sell the company, and I\u2019m going to move on to the next project. But the coolest thing about that is, being the owner or founder, you don\u2019t have to worry about that if you just put your heart and soul into it.\u201d", "Kim also wants to put more time into sharing nearly a decade\u2019s worth of his digital marketing knowledge.

And what was really cool was I was working for them, and I was working, enjoying my job. I was working through school. And then college came along, and I had to leave for college, which was cool. And so the first summer I got back from college, the first thing I did was rush back to my old job and say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m back from college. You guys told me when I get back from college you guys will let me come back and work.\u201d And at that time, I was living large because I was making like six bucks an hour, something like that, funny. And what was funny was I went back there and they were like, \u201cHey look kid, unfortunately all the positions are filled. You\u2019re just coming back for the summer, so I can\u2019t really make a position move, but maybe try back in a month or so.\u201d", "And you know, I was kind of bummed out and I remember walking out and one of the sales guys there who\u2019s seen me over the years was like, \u201cHey kid, where are you going?\u201d And I was like, \u201cYeah, they didn\u2019t have any jobs, I\u2019m going to try out some other dealerships.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you come try selling cars instead?\u201d You know what I mean? He\u2019s like, \u201cYour first summer back from college, and I know you went to college, but there\u2019s a lot of money in cars, and you should really think about selling cars.\u201d So, here I am nineteen years old \u2026 Yeah, I think I was nineteen years old, gung ho about selling cars. I walked in, of course the manager hired me on the spot because he knew who I was and how my work ethic was. I worked hard, and I showed up on time and all that good stuff, and I started selling cars.", "So here\u2019s what happened, and this is where things got interesting, and you coming in an Asian culture as well, just like me, may understand this a little bit more. I sat back and the first month I sold cars, I was the salesman of the month, sold 31 cars, and made $14,000. Now think about that, nineteen years old, made $14,000 his first month as just a summer job. There\u2019s a lot of banter, people say, \u201cOh, I got lucky. First time luck.\u201d That just fuels the fire in me. That\u2019s how I am, I\u2019m a competitive person. So the second month in, I was salesman of the month again, and made more money the next month. I think I made $18,000 the second month. That\u2019s when I made the decision that I\u2019m not going back to school.", "Now, as an Asian \u2026 Growing up in an Asian family, it was probably the hardest conversation I ever had in my family. My parents did not approve, they thought I was crazy, they thought I was wasting my life, ruining my life. And we made the promise that after a couple of years of making money, I\u2019d go back to school and pay my own way through college. That\u2019s where we ended off that conversation. So right after that, I decided to go full time, and I was just selling cars, making the money. I\u2019m an ambitious kid. When you\u2019re young, and your ambitious, it makes you want to do things.", "I remember this is the funny story that I always think about, and this is kind of like that pivotal moment for me when in was thinking about where these decisions happen. I think this is the entrepreneur in me that started to peak out. I remember one day, I was looking around, and I was like, \u201cSelling cars is good, but I feel like I\u2019m at the top. Now what can I do?\u201d So I looked over and saw this finance position. You\u2019re selling finance, these are the guys that after you close the deal you gotta solve the intangible items. That sounded like a great challenge selling a life insurance, car insurance, gap insurance, paint protection, all that stuff that you sell when you buy a car. When you go and \u2026 I wanted to be that guy, to sell that intangible because I thought it was really fun to take it to the next level.", "So I went to my manager, really excited, \u201cHey, I think I know what I want to do next. I know there\u2019s an opening. Do you think we can do this?\u201d He was like \u2026 I remember he talked to me about it, and he was just like, \u201cYou know, let me see what I can do, let me go talk to the general manager.\u201d He went up, a couple days later he came back and shook his head and was like, \u201cSorry, kid. Unfortunately, the position has been filled and they\u2019re not interested. They\u2019d rather have you on the floor right now, but maybe in a couple months.\u201d The anger inside of me actually grew at that point, which I\u2019m not an angry guy at all, but for some reason I just felt like he was lying. Later on, I discovered I\u2019m a great poker player, by the way. I realised I learned how to read people somewhere along the line.", "I remember I marched up to that next dealership \u2026 So I was at the Mitsubishi, Isuzu, Kia, dealership and I remember I stormed up to the Chevrolet dealer up top, where the general manager sat, and I went in his face and started getting angry. It\u2019s totally disrespectful what I did, I shouldn\u2019t ever have done that, but it\u2019s a great life lesson for me. I remember I just told him, \u201cI quit, I can\u2019t stand this place, I\u2019m outta here.\u201d Gung ho, top of the thing. It\u2019s crazy, crazy little story. I remember a month later, I get a call, it\u2019s the owner of the company, and he\u2019s calls me to come back in.", "What was interesting about that story was I come back in, we talk, and I told him my aspirations. I want to be at the top, I don\u2019t want to be at the bottom. He\u2019s like, \u201cWell, look kid, you got a lot to learn\u201d, and all that stuff. So I said, \u201cGreat, send me somewhere. Do something.\u201d So next thing know I\u2019m sitting in the Chevrolet dealership, I\u2019m selling cars with a promise in two months I get to go to Kansas, where I\u2019m gonna go for a two week class to learn finance, get insured, get my certifications and all that stuff. Low and behold, two months later we did that.", "So here I am, back at the same dealership, just in a different department, working finance. Eventually, what was really fun about that is, this is a weird situation and I\u2019m not sure if I handled it correctly, but it worked out well for me. I found out later on, even though I was producing such great numbers, I felt like my checks were the smallest. I couldn\u2019t figure out why. Low and behold, I found out there was some theft going on in the company, and I reported it. One thing led to another, I opened up a whole ring of the other guys who worked with me, and unfortunately they weren\u2019t doing the most positive things, and they were doing things that were illegal. They were stealing from the company. One thing led to another, and suddenly I\u2019m sitting alone up there as the finance director and everyone else has been removed from me. They were like, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re the temporary acting guy. We\u2019re gonna go hire people.\u201d", "And because I became the most senior, even though it\u2019d only been a year, year and half of me being in that position, I really just started to excel, and started taking control, learn management at that point, and started to control and be the leader at that point. And over that time, it was really good. I was doing great numbers. There\u2019s a lot of sales chart, like behind the scenes sales charts against other dealerships, and we were posting up great numbers. That\u2019s when I got poached. I got poached by another company, trying to get me to come over to them, but they didn\u2019t want me to come over as more financing. They wanted me to come and run the store, and not just one store, but eventually three stores. That\u2019s where I became a general manager for a Saturn dealership in \u2026 What year was it, 2000 \u2026 I can\u2019t remember. I was 25 when it happened.", "So I was really young, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, but I jumped in there and got in. What happened was again, I put all my heart into it, and pushed really hard, and worked hard, and within just a couple months we were the top 10 Saturn dealership in the nation. Then I started adding other dealerships under my belt that we already had. It was a great experience at that time.", "Now, in 2008 when General Motors decided to go under, this is where it gets really interesting. General Motors went under in the United States. They went bankrupt, right?", "Nathan: Yes.", "Jimmy: And Saturn was one of the companies that they just completely eliminated off the map. It was kind of sad. I remember that bittersweet moment that it was the end of that realm. They came to me and said, \u201cHey, we want to reopen these stores as Kia stores. Would you be interested?\u201d And that\u2019s when the difference of decision, where it continues to be the big thing for me, I realised that this isn\u2019t what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, so I told him flat out, \u201cI understand that you want me to help open the Kia dealership. I understand you want to give me a percentage of the ownership of the dealership, but I\u2019m not interested, but I will help you because out of respect to you guys. Help you open and get that company started, but then I\u2019m gonna leave.\u201d We set a hard date. I said May of 2008, I decided I\u2019m leaving the dealership, and it\u2019s time to move on.", "I remember it was then I left, I took a little break, and at that point I wasn\u2019t really 100% sure what I was gonna do. But at that time, I had a friend that lived locally. His name is , and he had a great internet marketing company over there. I always was curious what he was doing. That\u2019s when I went over to him, and I said, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on as far as what you do actually in business, but there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m really good at. I can sell stuff, and I\u2019m really good at operations, so I know your company.\u201d Because him and I had become really good friends, and he talks about this pretty publicly. He was at 1.6 million dollars debt in his company. He was looking to figure out how to fix this problem.", "Nathan: Oh, wow.", "Jimmy: I came in and said, \u201cI will help you, but in exchange \u2026 You need to teach me what you know, and I will help you get out of debt. And the moment you get out of debt, I will go off and do my own thing.\u201d That was our deal. I remember I went from making \u2026 I was making an average of $250, $300,000 a year at that point, and I went under $100,000. I think it was like $80,000 after that. That was the biggest change, but again decisions, right? I\u2019ll talk about decisions later on a lot more about it. From there I learned, and by I think it was late 2012, early 2013, I fulfilled my promise. We got the company completely out of debt. We got them on a positive turn, and that was the day I exited the company, and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to start my own thing.\u201d", "So from there, I left and I started to run a similar business to Onick\u2019s but I focused more on software, and a little bit more deft in \u2026 He was more like the info guy, he talks information, he teaches information, and he does a little bit of software. But I focused up on building softwares and so forth. And through those next couple years, I started to build a pretty decent business. I think the last year that I had that business, in 2016, we did like four and half million dollars. It wasn\u2019t a small business. So we built that business, and while that business was growing, Sendlane kind of started developing at that same exact time. What happened was very simple, the problem was people didn\u2019t understand what digital marketing or informarketing was back in 2012. So if you had these other large companies, and you started to do the things that we do, unfortunately, people tended to look away as we were doing something fraudulent or scamming because we\u2019re promoting other companies and so forth, with our affiliate marketing site, and they didn\u2019t like that.", "So we decided we\u2019re gonna build our own solution. When we built that own solution, it was never intended to be anything else but for us. That was the number one thing. We built it for us, it was a platform, it was ugly, it was purposeful. That was all we built it for. What got really interesting is by 2014, we had people knocking on our door, friends, clients, customers, saying, \u201cHey, what is this Sendlane thing you guys are using? What is this company you guys are using to send? I can\u2019t find anything about them on the web?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, there is nothing about the web because all we have is a log in page because all we do is we log in, and we use this app to do our thing. We automate, email, and we make email. We send email.\u201d", "So I remember, we made a decision in 2015, January, and we were just like, \u201cYou know what, let\u2019s just open the door and see what happens. Let\u2019s just see.\u201d We put up this horrible web page, with a payment portal, that wasn\u2019t probably the best way. I don\u2019t even think that SSL\u2019s or security was in there. I can\u2019t believe people actually signed up back then because there wasn\u2019t any payment security. And people started to sign up. Form 2015 to about 2017, we kind of ran it passively. It was doing very well, I\u2019m not gonna say that it was doing horrible, but it did very well. I think the first year we got up to $40 or $50,000 a month in MRR, which is monthly recurring revenue. Then in 2016, we climbed our way to about 80, 90 grand a month.", "And it was all organically through influence by myself and Onick, and using our education side. What we were doing is we were feeding education, teaching there how to do email marketing, then selling them on Sendlane, on our back-end and pushing them into our company. That\u2019s how we were building the company, and it was great and so forth, but there comes a time \u2026 At that point, by the way, I also owned a clothing store, a company called New out of Las Vegas, a street wear company because I was always avid of retail fan. That was another thing I was working on the side, which we grew pretty big too as well.", "There\u2019s a lot of businesses that were kind of in the thing. Let me tell you what happened. It\u2019s very simple, the life event happened. I had my daughter in August of 2017, and I remember the moment I saw her I realised that I needed to find more time in my life. I needed to find more availability in my life, yet I knew that I couldn\u2019t slow down business because I love business too much. I had to find a good balance of myself. That\u2019s when I made that decision in 2017 that it was time to wrap up everything, sell my ownership, sell my assets, sell my companies off, and just focus on one company.", "That\u2019s when I took that hard look, turned back, and I looked at the companies. I was like, \u201cThis is the company that I can see with incredible legs, and I know we haven\u2019t focused on it, but look what we did without even focusing on it. What can we do if I simply focus on it?\u201d That was August of 2017, fast forward to May of 2018, we were just discussing this in a meeting today, as we\u2019re talking with the leadership. We\u2019re just talking about how we\u2019ve grown so fast and dramatically. So from September of 2017, to May, we\u2019ve grown an average 10%, month over month. We\u2019ve already over doubled last year\u2019s revenue\u2019s already for this year, and we\u2019re on trajectory to do 3X to 4X this year. All because of one thing, focus. I focused, everyone focused, we all decided to put our heads in and start working on this company.", "We have three co-founders, myself, Onick, and another guy named Zack. Me and Zack, we focus every day, day-to-day, on Sendlane, and we\u2019re showing the results of it. It\u2019s been a really incredible journey. As a bootstrap company, funding out of our pockets, and starting this company out of our pockets. We sit here and we employ 25 people now, full-time, here at our San Diego office. We just remoulded to a beautiful 6,000 square foot office here, and we just continue to grow. We\u2019re already looking at what we\u2019re gonna have to do in the next year or two to continue to elevate. That\u2019s my story. That\u2019s where everything is. I kind of pour it out there for you. I know it was a little long, but hopefully that gave you a good idea of who I am.", "Nathan: Yeah, amazing man. It did. I just been taking notes. I got a tonne of questions. That\u2019s crazy. I really resonate with what you said around how it was difficult to convince your parents, just from Asian upbringing myself as well, around wanting to leave your job and going \u2026 Not pursuing college, and all that kind of stuff, you know?", "Jimmy: Yeah, absolutely.", "Nathan: I experienced the same thing where \u2026 My parents were never, similar to you, never really had a lot of money or anything. My Dad was a teacher, and my Mom was a nurse so they just know that you just work and you get a job. You go to school, you get good grades, and you get a good job. That\u2019s kind of what society tells us to do.", "Jimmy: Yeah, and you know there\u2019s a funny story about my Mother. She always used to tell me something, she said \u2026 When I was a little kid, my Mom would always say, \u201cYou need to be a doctor, you need to be a doctor. That\u2019s gonna make you the most money.\u201d I used to turn to her and say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a doctor. I\u2019m gonna make more money than a doctor ever.\u201d You know what I mean? She always reminds me of that story every time she talks to me, and it\u2019s an interesting one because when I was like five, seven years old, this is what I used to say apparently. I don\u2019t remember it, or recall it, but that\u2019s my little funny story.", "Nathan: There you go. So yeah man, I can really resonate. Dude, I\u2019m really curious, so you said you ended up selling some of these companies before your daughter was born. I\u2019ve heard this as well, I don\u2019t have any kids yet, but I have friends that they said, \u201cYeah, once my daughter or my son comes into this world, your whole perspective on life changes.\u201d I\u2019ve heard that many times, and I really respect that \u2019cause family\u2019s important to me as well. I\u2019m just curious, these other companies man, what happened?", "Jimmy: So I\u2019ll tell you about them real quick. One of the companies of course was an eCommerce store, so eCommerce/physical retail store. We sold clothing, we made our own clothing, all that good stuff. What was really cool about it is, I jumped into that company. I bought into that company because they were struggling, they needed some money, they needed some revenue, and I saw a lot of life for them. The first one was a company called New. 2014, I bought into that company. They were doing about 800 grand in revenue, and the one thing I could bring to the company I told them was two things. The two things I could bring was operations and media buy-in because those were my specialties.", "I remember we scaled that business by 2016 to 2.9 million dollars, so from $800,000 to 2.9 in two years, growing an eCommerce store all based on advertising and just structuring the company better. So we grew that company really fast, but the biggest problem that we continued to have, me and my partner \u2026 I love him, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with him, we\u2019re still friends to this day, was that we just saw a very different vision. Finding co-founders that are founders or owners of businesses having the same vision, super important. My vision was to blow it up, make it as big as possible and cash out because I thought that\u2019s how clothing works because that is how clothing works. You\u2019re a hero today, zero tomorrow. I knew that and understood that in business, but him it was such more passion for it. It was such more of a vision for it, he wanted to make it cool and relevant all the time.", "That created a battle between us a lot because he wanted to talk about scaling back marketing, while I wanted to rake up marketing, spend more money, order more clothes, get more stuff, get more sales, get more people. I\u2019m the guy who pushes, and I\u2019m the guy who comes with sales experience. We can in a difference of opinions, we realised, \u201cHey, look the best thing we can do is part ways as friends. I\u2019ll sell you back my ownership, and we\u2019ll part ways.\u201d And that\u2019s what we did. That was my first one. That was happening before my daughter was born, but I knew she was already pregnant when I made that decision. That was the first one.", "The second company was my personal private one, the same one when I left Onick in 2013, that I grew. And that company grew tremendously. We were creating all these different little mini \u2026 What I used to call them, and it\u2019s not a real term, but I used to call them little micro SASes. They were just products that did one little thing that they did really well. So like an ebook cover creator, a doodle video animation creator, a click tracking platform. A lot of little, great little features, and they would all do a little bit of revenue, but they all added up together, and we created a great customer culture and stuff.", "When I sold that company, it wasn\u2019t \u2026 I sold the assets of the company, I still technically own that company, but I don\u2019t have any assets left in that company. I literally went off and was able to turn around and quickly, within a matter of a month and a half, sell seven different properties off, software properties, with reoccurring revenue off to five different people I sold seven different properties off to.", "Nathan: Wow.", "Jimmy: That was a nice way to sell out. And it came with my reputation and products. I had an ultra-low refund rate, super happy level customers. I sold products that did one thing. That\u2019s the one thing I\u2019ll tell you that too many companies try to do too many things. Or people think that people want a thousand things, but if you\u2019re really good at three things, you\u2019re much better of a company or a product than you are if you can do 100 things, but do them half-ass and mediocre. That\u2019s always been the thought process in my head, and that\u2019s how I always looked at things. That\u2019s what we did, and I was able to sell those off. I remember I started that sale in July of 2017, right before my daughter was born. I completed the last sale in December of 2017, so over the next couple months I was able to sell, contracts legal and all that stuff. I had buyers out pretty fast within the first month just to get everyone going. Then we just went into legal and all that good stuff. Yeah, I was able to exit out all my assets and move on.", "Nathan: Yeah, wow. And I really like what you said. So you believe with a good SAS company is good at only one thing or three things?", "Jimmy: Well, I mean \u2026 When I say one thing, or three things, it doesn\u2019t matter. What I mean by that is focus on what you are. Sendlane, we\u2019re an email automation company. We are really good at email. I\u2019m not good at landing pages, I\u2019m not good at bundles, I\u2019m not good at this, that, I\u2019m just really good at email automation, and I like it that way. As opposed to a company that may offer what we offer, plus this, plus that, plus that. Then they end up diluting where they\u2019re not really good at everything. They\u2019re just kind of okay, good enough, but there\u2019s not value.", "The analogy I use is very simple. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been on a cruise before, but a cruise \u2026 When you go on a cruise, you\u2019re all inclusive, at least in American it is. And when you go on a cruise the food is not great, but it\u2019s abundant, and it\u2019s okay. So you\u2019re like, \u201cEh, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay.\u201d You know what I mean? That\u2019s how I look at it, but you don\u2019t get like, \u201cOh man, that food is amazingly great.\u201d like when you go to a nice restaurant. You know what I mean? That\u2019s how I always like to compare it. That\u2019s how I look at in SAS and any business actually, it doesn\u2019t matter. If you\u2019re just really good at a core feature, or a core product, whatever you\u2019re trying to do. I guess whatever your core demographic, or niche, or whatever it is, that\u2019s where you\u2019re gonna be good. When you try to get to big, and try to do too much, you start to hurt yourself, I think. That\u2019s always been my mindset with things. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been able to grow so dramatically and fast in many instances.", "Nathan: Yeah, I think that\u2019s a really good thing to touch on because I learned this lesson as well. When you try \u2026 We\u2019ve had to shut down things we\u2019ve then founded because it \u2026 Just because you can launch something, and you can get it profitable, that function or something to make more money to grow your business, doesn\u2019t mean you necessarily should do it. When you\u2019re trying to scale, a lot of times you think you should create more, but sometimes it\u2019s just creating less and focusing on less.", "Jimmy: Yep, absolutely.", "Nathan: Are you familiar \u2026 I think focus is so underrated. I love how you said you didn\u2019t really try to grow Sendlane, it grew basically pretty much organically, and then once you actually started focusing on it, and it\u2019s just an insane obsession \u2026 I can see now that work ethic, and you love to compete, and yeah, man. You guys are just double downing, double downing, double downing now on Sendlane. I\u2019m really curious, you guys are a bootstrap, do you think you will raise capital? What\u2019s the plan there? Are you gonna stay bootstrapped?", "Jimmy: Yeah, absolutely. This is something that we discussed a lot between the three of us, pretty heavily last couple of months because it goes like this basically \u2026 This is something that someone said to me, and it kind of resonated with me pretty fast about being bootstrapped. Bootstrap and everything is great, and it\u2019s a way of life of course. I totally respect it, and I think that it\u2019s been a great journey for me for multiple companies, and I only knew what bootstrapping was, but he said it this way. He said, \u201cLook, you can continue doing what you do, and become a 20 million dollar company, 30 million dollar company, whatever you want. And you may own, 33% of a 33 million dollar company.\u201d He goes, \u201cOr, you could take in five million dollars, 10 million dollars of money, and you become 20% owner of 100 million, 200 million, 400 million dollar company.\u201d He goes, \u201cThink about this, okay?\u201d", "And the thing difference that you\u2019re gonna find is that being bootstrapped, you\u2019re always gonna slow yourself down because of revenue and money, but when you have a large infusion of money, it becomes a different mindset because now all you\u2019re focused on is growth, and not the money. It\u2019s the same thing they say about everybody. If you focus on the growth and not the money, that\u2019s usually what\u2019s gonna happen, or the product, or whatever it may be. So the answer is simple. I am going to be raising money, not this summer, but this fall. I\u2019m taking a total different approach than typical guy.", "I\u2019m not gonna go pitch a thousand people and try to slam my way into money. I want to actually go out this summer and meet probably 100 VCs. I want to go sit in their office. Never talk about the product, or what we\u2019re doing, or what we\u2019re raising. I just want to meet them and see if they\u2019re a fit to be a real partner, to be able to help me grow and scale. I\u2019m looking for partners, not looking for just capital. So I look at it that way, where I\u2019m looking at it a little bit different, but I will be raising probably about five million dollars this fall.", "Nathan: Yeah, okay amazing. One thing I\u2019ve always wondered \u2019cause Foundr\u2019s 100% bootstrapped, and look I\u2019m not indifferent of being bootstrapped or raising capital. I\u2019m curious have you thought about doing equity crowd funding or anything interesting like that?", "Jimmy: I thought about that, I just \u2026 Okay, this might be the human emotion in me, but I feel really weird about doing a crowd fund \u2019cause it tends to have people who may not supposed to be involved in this world, or investing in anything. I don\u2019t want to \u2026 There\u2019s always risk no matter what. I truly believe in myself, but at that same time I feel kind of bad, and weird, asking people that may or may not actually be part of it, like family friends. That stuff has always been really weird for me, so I like the idea of taking money from a fund where they just have so much money they just want to put money in there.", "Nathan: Yeah, I know what you mean. They\u2019re just opening up equity crown funding in Australia. The government\u2019s \u2026 They have to let it pass, and someone that I know, he runs one of the largest crowd funding platforms in Australia. He\u2019s pivoting \u2026 He set up a second company, which is equity crowd funding, and he come to me because we do a successful crowd funding campaign. He said, \u201cYou guys should do \u2026 Foundr should do an equity crowd funding campaign.\u201d I know what you mean. You don\u2019t want to feel like you\u2019re begging, right?", "Jimmy: Yeah, exactly. And I feel like that\u2019s what it comes down to. If you can\u2019t get a professional investor to invest in your company, and you need to go crowd fund \u2026 Not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with that, it\u2019s just to me I\u2019d rather have a professional on my side. Plus, let\u2019s not face \u2026 I\u2019m sure you know this, having great people on your side is always a good thing. People who know what\u2019s going on in business, who can actually help you, that you can make a phone call. When you do this crowd funding, or equity crowd funding, you don\u2019t really get that partner. You don\u2019t get that extra oomph that you expect by giving away equity in the company.", "Nathan: Yeah, no not at all. You don\u2019t get the expertise. You basically get the funds plus have ambassadors for your brand that will go out and just spread it like wildfire. That was something that I found interesting. That\u2019s what he told me the whole play was.", "Jimmy: Got it. Well, our company is not sexy enough as a company to be ambassadors. I don\u2019t see people running around going, \u201cYou want to know about email automation?\u201d I don\u2019t know how many people really care about that. That\u2019s the second part. At least for you, you have Foundr, which is like something cool, entrepreneur. Everyone\u2019s talking about it right now, so might as well leverage that, right? But yeah, who\u2019s gonna tell them about email automation. Let\u2019s be serious. You know what I mean?", "Nathan: Yeah, I agree man, I agree. So I\u2019m curious as well, if I got five millions injected into Foundr, I\u2019d scale up big time in terms of hiring. We\u2019d set up a couple offices. set one in New York, one in L.A., is that kind of a \u2026 What\u2019s the plan? You just scale up on hiring and customer acquisition, right?", "Jimmy: I would spend almost 80% of the money, majority, on just growth. I would spend it on media buying, and salespeople, and making sure that we\u2019re maximising it. I don\u2019t like to waste money, so I would take that money and make sure that I return an ROI on that money as fast as possible.", "Nathan: Yeah. And when it comes to media buying, you said that\u2019s one of your strong slates. You came into that eComms, and you just did media buying and ops.", "Jimmy: Yep.", "Nathan: When you do media buying, what\u2019s your rule of thumb? Do you look for a three-to-one, and two-to-one? And how long, over what time period do you expect to make that back? Or do you try and be profitable on the front end? I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts on that side of things.", "Jimmy: Sure.", "Nathan: Especially the SAS company as well.", "Jimmy: Sure, absolutely. So if I\u2019m looking at eCommerce company, for example, I need to make ROI instantly. Usually at least two to three times that ROI is the goal because costs, everything else starts getting pushed into there, not just your media spend. If I\u2019m looking at something like a SAS product, you\u2019ve got to figure out what your new numbers are, the details are, and the numbers. You gotta know how much your customers are worth, what the average stick rate, return rate is, basically understanding your lifetime value of the customer. And then really, just determine how much you can spend based around how much they do.", "For example, for me if I spend $100 to acquire a customer for Sendlane, I\u2019m pretty safe because I know in two and half months, knowing my churn rate, which everything all slides up, two and half to three months, I\u2019m starting to break even on that point. From there it becomes profit, if that makes sense. When I know my average customer value is about six times the value that I\u2019m spending on my CPA of making that acquisition, if that makes sense to you?", "Nathan: Yes. 100%.", "Jimmy: That\u2019s how I look at it that way too as well. You\u2019ve got to always look at it multiple ways. It really just depends on your business. In the SAS business, it\u2019s all about \u2026 It\u2019s a reoccurring business, so it makes it a little bit easier, but if you were selling something like a shirt, which we did a lot of, I know my $30 shirt, I had to get my customer at under $10, in order for it to be semi-profitable, and under $7 makes it really profitable. That\u2019s how I knew it.", "Nathan: Yeah, gotcha. Man, we gotta talk a little bit about email marketing because you\u2019re one of our teaches, teaching our advanced email marketing course. I haven\u2019t seen it yet, but I\u2019m told that it\u2019s just absolutely insane. I helped work on the course structure, and I\u2019m really excited to get our team to go through it. Yeah, man. Talk to me, if somebody isn\u2019t using email effectively right now, or they\u2019re \u2026 They send emails \u2026 Let\u2019s just say somebody\u2019s listening in, they\u2019ve got a company, they\u2019re sending emails probably around promotions or what not. They run a sale every now and then, but that\u2019s about it. Where\u2019s a good place people can start when it comes to email on raising your lead value?", "Jimmy: That\u2019s a loaded question, you know that? What\u2019s really interesting is this. Let\u2019s back it up real quick, and talk about this. The evolution of email is changing so much. The biggest thing that I tell people is very simple. People are still trying to do what worked in email marketing in 2008, in 2018, if that makes sense? People don\u2019t recognise that things have changed so dramatically, and it all starts with the basic simple. People are just getting a heck of a lot more email every day. What\u2019s the last stat? I think the last stat was 2015, which was 145 emails per day. I\u2019m guessing we\u2019re probably up to 180, 200 emails per day. I\u2019m sure you can attribute that in your inbox as well too, right?", "Nathan: Yeah, 100% man. It\u2019s crazy.", "Jimmy: So what it is, is all about cutting through a noise and being someone that someone wants to not only listen to, and also can be relatable to and so forth. There\u2019s no right or wrong at the end of the day. It\u2019s all about how you build it. We talk about the word tribe, right? You\u2019re talking about your tribe, the people who listen to you, the people who want to be a part of your company, want to do it. I was talking about a great company with one of my co-founders just the other day. A company called Touch of Modern, which sells higher end, really cool gadgets.", "I told them I always look for those emails. Every day they come, and they sell me on everything, and then he goes, \u201cDo you ever buy anything?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t actually bought anything, I just like to look at things all the time. But I open it and click all the time.\u201d He was laughing, he goes, \u201cThen they\u2019re not doing effective email marketing.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, probably not because they\u2019re not pushing any urgency one me. They\u2019re not giving me any incentive or reason to be buying.\u201d They just taught me about some cool stuff that I can look at, and one day when I think I need that random thing like a pizza oven for my grill, when I think I need that, I\u2019m gonna go back to them a buy it. In fact, I was thinking about it, but I still haven\u2019t pulled the trigger. But if they would have put a timer on that page, or told me that this was my last chance to buy it, and told me that it\u2019s gonna go up in price, I would have snatched it up 10 seconds ago and bought it.", "The idea and mindset of email, and availability, and just value and so forth, is just so different these days. I think the evolution started in that essence. So to come back to your question and say where would you start, that\u2019s probably the most loaded question that I\u2019ve heard. I don\u2019t have a good answer for that.", "Nathan: Sorry man.", "Jimmy: Yeah, there\u2019s probably a million places that you can start, but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s right or wrong to say. But I guess to start, go get a great course that\u2019s gonna teach you the basics on the foundation of email marketing. I know that to me, and I\u2019m sure you were like this too, when you know too much and you realise it, you think that the basics are so easy. But you forget that the basics are also really hard to most people who have never understood it. That\u2019s always something that I \u2026 It\u2019s hard for me because I\u2019m so into this space and understanding it, that it\u2019s really hard for me to back up and say what\u2019s a great way to start.", "Nathan: Okay. Well then let me try this again. Let\u2019s just take it back. Let\u2019s just say you\u2019re spending \u2026 You said you\u2019re prepared to spend $100 to acquire a customer, and that\u2019d probably a trial for Sendlane, right?", "Jimmy: Yep.", "Nathan: Yep. So what would you do from an email standpoint to I guess give that person a great experience?", "Jimmy: To make sure that we\u2019re \u2026 Okay, so that would be \u2026 We\u2019re talking about how to get that person in a trial and talk about what we\u2019re doing in order to maximise that person, right?", "Nathan: Yeah.", "Jimmy: There\u2019s multiple things that we do, but the biggest thing is obviously you can\u2019t email each and every person that comes through yourself so that\u2019s why email automation is such a powerful thing. But not just email automation, right? So the typical way \u2026 This is the typical way that everybody sets up their stuff is very simple. Day one, send this email, day two, send this email, day three send this email, and so forth. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it, it still works, but we know that that\u2019s not the way that you should be sending email anymore because it\u2019s not personalised, it\u2019s not behavioural based. You need to work on it in a way that you\u2019re taking your thought process and email at a total different level.", "Think about how your consumers \u2026 Remember, the one thing I always like to tell is remember there\u2019s a real person on the other end of it. It\u2019s so easy to forget that when you\u2019re working on the internet, and you\u2019re working on your internet business, that there\u2019s a real person on the end of that. So cater to that spirit, and try to make it feel like they\u2019re working with you and not for you, or working towards you. You know what I mean? Work with them, make them feel like they\u2019re a part of it. I call this being more behavioural based automation.", "There\u2019s many things that you could do from providing value. I have a thing called cookie system that I talk about how you can create the balance of giving a person a cookie to make them feel like you\u2019re giving them value so you can continue to maintain that relationship with them, and create a tribe. And create events, right? Remember I talked about that Touch of Modern email guys. If they would have thrown and even and say, \u201cFor the next three days we\u2019re putting this thing on sale. Come by.\u201d, and sent me a couple emails to follow through with that. I would have bought it absolutely.", "I talk about that because creating an even for example is a great way to create that value and create that reason for them to continue wanting to listen. There\u2019s other things we do, so if you\u2019re looking at automation, I talk about this. If you are bringing someone into your funnel, so you start a trial. I create a reason for them to continue wanting to read my email. It would be tips, tricks, I try to provide value, I celebrate items. One of the things that people do in trials that I always find funny is that a lot of companies, as it gets closer to the end of the trial, they get quieter, looser and tighter, and try to be really meek about trying to let people know. They don\u2019t want to alert them, whereas we on our side, we actually celebrate it. We actually embrace it and tell them tat they\u2019re joining the team, getting ready to join in being a full-fledged member, and making it a much more positive experience instead of that negative connotation that comes with a trial offer.", "I think that that\u2019s important. I think based on their behaviour, do they open or click, do they purchase, did they spend money, did they \u2026 Where are they located, what kind of device are they working on, what are they doing, what kind of actions have they done in the past, what have they done with you in the past? Having a lot of detailed, micro segmented information allows you to cater these emails directly and personalise, so a person who may not be opening your emails, you may need to get a little more aggressive. Or they may be a person that opens and clicks all your emails, that\u2019s me of Touch of Modern, they should realise, \u201cHey, this guy is really engaged with you, but he\u2019s not buying anything. Let\u2019s put him through a different funnel that pushes him to buy something from us so we have an LTD with this guy.\u201d", "Or, you got a guy who just buys everything, then you know this is the guys who buys everything. Let\u2019s tag it and make sure that this is the guy that we talk to, connect with, whatever it may be in you businesses, however you do it. But creating that personalised experience is bar-none the best way to make people want to actually listen to, or want to open your emails. That\u2019s ", "email automation", ", and that\u2019s the best way you can do it now in 2018 and forward.", "Nathan: Behaviour, behavioural.", "Jimmy: Behaviour events, yes. Intelligent automation, intelligent emails. Making sure that you\u2019re creating these things based on what they\u2019re telling you they want to hear, not what you think they want to hear.", "Nathan: So user combination in Sendlane of lead, scoring, and if this statements?", "Jimmy: Yeah, if, else statements, tagging, revenue tracking, even now to be targeting and making sure that you\u2019re dropping \u2026 Following them around and sending them emails when they visit your webpage, or a check out page, or whatever it may be. For example, an abandoned cart is one of the most powerful types of customers. You should be closing 88% of those people, but most people don\u2019t. They close like 30, 20% of it because they just don\u2019t follow-up. You know what I mean? Follow-up with people, communicate. There\u2019s a reason why Amazon, world\u2019s largest eCommerce, it does such a great job with active carts, and following you all around the internet. At least in America here, when you go on Amazon, you look at a product, it\u2019s gonna follow you on Facebook, it\u2019s gonna follow you on Google, on every other website you go to, and it\u2019s gonna send you an email, or two, or three. You know what I mean? They don\u2019t do that because they like to spend money, they do that because that\u2019s how they close deals and they understand that.", "So things like that you can do with email. You can do it with Sendlane of course, but you can do it with most email platforms that are more advanced thinking. That\u2019s what I always say. I don\u2019t like to pick on any company, but there\u2019s a lot of companies out there that don\u2019t have that advanced thinking because \u2026 The big thing that I\u2019ve always noticed about SAS companies or tools that we use in our business is there\u2019s practitioners and there\u2019s just people who are thought leaders. People who just think that they know what people want, and there\u2019s people who have done things, like myself. Where you\u2019ve been an email marketer for so long, you really just know what people want, and what the most important aspects of a business are.", "Nathan: Yeah, they\u2019re the people that create the best kind of SAS products because they are in the trenches.", "Jimmy: Yeah, absolutely.", "Nathan: And that\u2019s one of your unfair advantages that you have right now.", "Jimmy: Yeah, absolutely. And if I look at every other company that competes with me, I look at most of them and go, \u201cI don\u2019t think that you\u2019ve ever done email marketing in your life. It\u2019s very clear you haven\u2019t because of the features you continue to release, or the feature you think people need.\u201d Versus us, we\u2019re looking at it in a complete different way. I look at my business, what I needed, what I did, and I know that the type of person that I\u2019m looking for is just like me, so why not build products or features that are figured out, that are just for someone like myself. And it always works out really well because everyone gets excited about it.", "Nathan: Yeah, no. That\u2019s amazing man. So dude, look we have work towards wrapping up, but one thing you mentioned was around decisions, which you wanted to talk more about. Would you like to share?", "Jimmy: Yeah, absolutely. You know, one of the biggest failures of most entrepreneurs is they get stuck on decisions so much. They take days, weeks, years, thinking about decisions, how to do this, what to do, how to start, whatever it is. I think the biggest thing as an entrepreneur is kind of following your gut and making that decision as fast as possible. And eliminating a time zone \u2026 And the worst thing you can do is fail. People are so afraid of failure in most cases, but the reality is failure is the one thing that\u2019s gonna grow your foundation to become a better founder, better entrepreneur, and being able to grow a business and do something with yourself.", "I\u2019d rather make that decision and fail at it, multiple times, and make multiple decision fails, than ponder for six months and never make that decision not knowing my result of positive or of failure at that point so that\u2019s why I talk about decision and how important they are especially at the early stages. If you\u2019re and early stage founder, you really need to be able to make those decisions. Yeah, it might be a little too expensive. Yeah, it might be a little bit risky. Yeah, it might be this or that, but guess what? You only get one shot, you might as well do it now while you get the shot, instead of sitting back and just trying to decide if that was the right idea or not.", "I say with decisions, follow your gut, be impulsive, but educated impulsive. Don\u2019t be just wild, wild west, pulling out a gun, shooting like impulsive, but more educated. Think about it for a second, but don\u2019t think about it for years and months. Just make that decision. It\u2019s a great way to make that decision, and the worst case scenario is you fail at it. Then you learn a lesson, and you move on. What\u2019s the big deal? Life goes on? The saying I say to everybody, and I say it to all my friends is, \u201cIt\u2019s never as bad as seems.\u201d Very simple, \u201cIt\u2019s never as bad as it seems.\u201d Failure is never as bad as it seems. It\u2019ll teach you something, and you\u2019ll go back and realise that was actually a great idea.", "Nathan: Yeah, no. I agree, and you talked about decisions and following your gut. Has your gut ever been wrong?", "Jimmy: Oh, absolutely. Many times. All the time, but we don\u2019t talk about those right? Well, we do. We do talk about them, but we do talk about them meaning we talk about them to learn from them, but we don\u2019t focus on them as a problem. We focus on how we do it better, and focus on the solution, as any entrepreneur should do. We never focus on the problem. That\u2019s what I always tell my team too, \u201cDon\u2019t come with me to a problem. Come with me with a solution to the problem that you discovered.\u201d", "Nathan: Yeah, that\u2019s a good one. I like that one. One thing you\u2019re talking about offline, which I really liked \u2026 We were both talking about this is talent, and when you\u2019re wanting to scale it really is about hiring the best people that have done something before, and just finding great people. That\u2019s how a company is built. I\u2019m obviously the face of Foundr, but \u2026 Or you look at Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, like Elon Musk is the face of Tesla, but he\u2019s not \u2026 Yes, he\u2019s an extremely smart guy, but he\u2019s got an incredible team behind him that is building everything that he\u2019s building. I think that\u2019s so key. But man, I\u2019m talking too much. Please, you \u2026", "Jimmy: Yeah, so what we\u2019re talking about is hiring great people in your community, into your team and stuff like that. We talked about this. Early days, I used to do the same thing, and I always thought that was the right way when I first started my companies, was that I needed to hire people to train them, to teach them my way because I thought I was the best at something, and I needed to get them and train them, and spend months working on them just to find out they\u2019re not good at the position, and then they end up leaving. Then I realised one day, maybe I should just start looking for the best people. The ones that cost a little bit more money, that maybe I can\u2019t afford perfectly, but I can make the sacrifices at work. And the world of difference that you find in a person that knows and understands the task, and knows and understands what\u2019s going on, is the number one thing that you need as a founder, as an entrepreneur. Someone who can do things.", "I know that a lot of people listening \u2026 And I did the same thing, I\u2019d sit there and I\u2019d think I can do these tasks the best, you\u2019re not \u2026 I\u2019ll never find someone to replace. Well, I find out really quickly lately, I\u2019ve been humbled a lot in the last couple years especially. I realised there\u2019s a lot of people that are much better than me at most the things that I do. It\u2019s great that they\u2019re willing to work for me \u2019cause they don\u2019t want to do their own thing and take the risk. As an entrepreneur, you\u2019re willing to take that risk and be the founder, and be the leader. But at the same time, having a great person under you, or a great team under you that knows what\u2019s going on also, believe me, it\u2019s a heck of a lot of grey hairs out of your head too as well. Just not feeling like you\u2019re always chasing the talent. The talent\u2019s already there, you\u2019re just working with the talent to grow the business.", "Nathan: Yeah, and you said something as well that really resonated with me that sometimes you think \u2026 I\u2019m first to say I used to think this as well where it\u2019s like I don\u2019t want to pay that amount of money because \u2026 It pays its weight in gold, right?", "Jimmy: Absolutely, yeah. You focus on that talent, and the money comes with the talent, and the money comes with what they\u2019re building. As long as you, obviously, have that right vision. That parts a little bit tough because I know how \u2026 Especially the early stage companies, it\u2019s really tough when you\u2019re hiring people to make things work, but when you chose the life of being an entrepreneur or a founder, you chose the life of being poor at sometimes, and being broke at sometimes, and struggling sometimes, living off Ramen. That\u2019s all fine and dandy, you gotta get through that part. That\u2019s what makes you so strong.", "Nathan: I agree, I agree. So dude, we have to work towards wrapping up, but last two questions. This has been awesome. What\u2019s next? You said you\u2019re doing a bit of raising round, but what\u2019s next, and where\u2019s the best place people can find out more about yourself and your work?", "Jimmy: Oh, absolutely. So when you mean what\u2019s next, just so I understand clarification, you mean for Sendlane or just myself in general?", "Nathan: Both.", "Jimmy: Okay, so if I\u2019m looking at Sendlane, we\u2019ve got a whole road map of things that we want to do to continue to elevate the features in our platform that are continuously being congruent to what we\u2019re doing. So it\u2019s just a continuous game of just continuing to move forward, and push. Trying to revolutionise, be the leader in the industry, big goals.", "What\u2019s left personally, as far as business side, I don\u2019t know what my future is. I\u2019m sure the next problem will arise as I continue to grow this business, which will eventually trigger my next company. It should be really fun and interesting, but I don\u2019t build this company to get acquire it, or sell, I build this company because I think it\u2019s a really fun passion of mine, and it\u2019s been a great journey, and great people here. I think that the number one thing for me at the end of the day is that I\u2019m gonna keep pushing until something happens. If someone offers me, I\u2019m not gonna tell you that I\u2019m not ever gonna sell the company \u2019cause if someone offers me enough money, I\u2019m gonna sell the company, and I\u2019m gonna move on to the next project. But the coolest thing about that is being the owner or founder, you don\u2019t have to worry about that if you just put your heart and soul into it.", "Then the second question you asked was how to hear more about me. There\u2019s a couple places to learn more about me. I\u2019ve got a YouTube channel that I do share some information. I\u2019ve been pretty terrible at sharing information lately. I got a Facebook page that I get. Don\u2019t share that much information. I guess my real answer is I\u2019m so engulfed in my business and my family right now, I stopped caring about sharing as much. I\u2019m just so focused on it. I think as my daughter starts to grow up \u2026 Now, she\u2019s starting to grow up, and things are starting to get a little better, I\u2019m gonna start getting back to blogging and sharing a wealth of knowledge. I love sharing knowledge.", "On YouTube for example I used to just share anything and everything. Things that people pay for all the time, I used to give away for free, and people would get very mad at me all the time. I used to get threats about things because of that. So check out my YouTube channel, it\u2019s pretty cool. There\u2019s a lot of random stuff in there for Facebook marketing. Things that I only know. I always keep to things I already know. Then of course, I got my Facebook. Then we\u2019ve got a great blog at Sendlane, so blog.Sendlane.com.

I think that this is gonna be \u2026 So if you\u2019re listening to this, and eventually you want to dig into my brain, I did a two day brain dump in Los Angeles. I literally dropped 10 years of knowledge of email marketing at the advanced level that you probably don\u2019t hear about from deliverability to automation, to engagement, to the metrics. The things that people don\u2019t talk about. I\u2019m sure everyone can talk about how to write an email, or talk about how to look at an email, but have you ever thought about the core focus of how an emails put together. Or how the thought process works, how does the technology behind it work, and what are the best practises, and what do those metrics really mean to the health of your list.", "These are the things I talked about, and I talked about at such a high level that I really enjoyed it because I did it. The same passion you may hear in my voice here today, I had that same passion for two days straight in a little tiny studio for two days straight. We just went through, and I just shared it all on paper. I\u2019m really excited for it myself because it\u2019s always been kind of a small passion of mine to share this information out there. And Foundr has been giving me the platform to go out there and share this information to the world. I know that we\u2019re gonna do a great job together. I plan on marketing myself too, just because I\u2019m so proud of it myself. 10 years of knowledge, brain dump, two days, all into an advanced email marketing course that gonna be coming out maybe late summer early fall is what we\u2019re talking about.", "Nathan: Yeah.", "Jimmy: So whenever it comes out, that\u2019s something you should be looking for.", "Nathan: Awesome then.

But as a child of the 1960s who was fascinated with the Apollo program, he also felt compelled to explore space. So, he did both.", "After getting accepted into Harvard Medical School, Diamandis co-founded the International Space University, which today has graduated ", "more than 4,600 students from over 105 countries", ", and started International Microspace, a rocket company that was later acquired by CTA Incorporated.", "Even after he obtained his medical degree, instead of practicing medicine, Diamandis continued building businesses, many in the area of space. He founded XPRIZE, a global contest whose winners include a team that developed the first non-governmental manned spacecraft; and Zero-G, which has helped people like Stephen Hawking, Buzz Aldrin, and Martha Stewart experience weightlessness in a modified Boeing 727 that performs aerobatic maneuvers at 32,000 feet (if you fancy a ride, the Zero-G Experience starts at $5,400 per person).", "While Diamandis has worked hard to get here, he\u2019s having a lot of fun too. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a 9-year-old kid pursuing my dreams,\u201d he says.", "Looking at Diamandis\u2019 long list of companies is a bit like reading synopses of science fiction novels.

But Diamandis believes we have good reason to be hopeful. One of his most popular contributions is his concept of abundance, which he\u2019s given a TED talk and written a book about. It\u2019s the idea that technology is transforming scarce resources into abundant ones, quickly closing the gap between the haves and the have-nots.", "Google, for example, has given the general public access to a storehouse of knowledge that history\u2019s greatest philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists could never have imagined.", "Further, exponential technologies\u2014such as artificial intelligence, 3D printing, and virtual reality\u2014have made it easier than ever to produce solutions at scale, solutions that, previously, only governments and massive corporations were capable of producing.", "\u201cEnergy is a perfect example,\u201d Diamandis says. Humans went from killing whales to get oil for lamps, to mining mountains for coal, to drilling the ocean floor for oil. Meanwhile, the sun bathes the earth in more energy than we could use in a year. An exponential entrepreneur, therefore, would find a way to use technology to efficiently harness the sun\u2019s energy and distribute it to the masses.", "Through the lens of abundance, Diamandis sees an opportunity for entrepreneurs to change the world, so much so that he created an exclusive community, Abundance Digital, that aims to do just that. He hosts monthly webinars and provides courses to inspire its roughly 3,000 members to think bigger, teaching them that \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest problems are the world\u2019s biggest business opportunities.\u201d", "Because of exponential technologies, Diamandis envisions a future where AI makes education and healthcare effectively free and available to all, where self-driving electric cars make using a car service cheaper than owning a vehicle\u2014a future where nothing is truly scarce.", "Though Diamandis keeps his eyes to the sky, that doesn\u2019t mean he has his head in the clouds. He acknowledges that every new venture carries the potential for failure.", "When asked if he ever has doubts when starting a new business, he says, \u201cOf course, I mean, I\u2019m not insane. But it doesn\u2019t slow me down.\u201d That\u2019s because, though he recognizes entrepreneurship\u2019s inherent difficulties, he draws strength from his unshakeable sense of purpose.", "Diamandis recommends beginning every entrepreneurial journey with determining your \u201cMassively Transformative Purpose,\u201d or MTP. This is what keeps you going when the going gets tough; it\u2019s the thing that, even if you do not succeed, grants you the satisfaction of knowing that your time was spent improving humanity.", "\u201cPeople have to understand why they\u2019re building their business,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re just trying to build a business to make money, I view that as sort of an empty pursuit, and when it gets hard, you don\u2019t have the emotional energy to push through and succeed.\u201d", "So what are Diamandis\u2019 MTPs? He has a few: opening up space exploration to more people, extending the healthy human lifespan, and inspiring entrepreneurs to solve the world\u2019s biggest problems. For an advanced entrepreneur, having three MTPs is fine, but Diamandis recommends beginners start with just one.", "Behind every great entrepreneur is a great team, and Diamandis is no exception. He has a roughly 12-person \u201cstrike force\u201d that works with him across all of his ventures. Each team member has been carefully selected.", "\u201cI don\u2019t suffer assholes or fools,\u201d says Diamandis, whose rigorous hiring process is proof of that. To fill a position, he\u2019ll sometimes run a global contest. The winners advance to a 60- or 90-day trial period, after which, the entire team has to vote them in, meaning there must be 100 percent acceptance.", "\u201cOne person who\u2019s out of whack can send the whole thing careening,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo it\u2019s really important that we operate as a team.\u201d", "While he uses the Kolbe test, which assesses conative skills, Diamandis doesn\u2019t rely heavily on testing to make his choices, preferring to use the team interview process as a major determiner.", "Ultimately, though, his hiring decisions boil down to one simple metric: He needs to genuinely like the candidate.", "\u201cIf when we\u2019re in the meeting and that person is talking, if I\u2019m, in the back of my mind, saying, \u2018I wish this guy would shut up,\u2019 that\u2019s not a good situation. On the other hand, if we\u2019re in a meeting and I\u2019m saying, \u2018Listen, I haven\u2019t heard from you. I really want to hear your thoughts,\u2019 that\u2019s a good situation. So I need to respect them and want to hear what they have to say.\u201d", "Those same likeability and respect factors go into his selecting a co-founder or CEO. For every company Diamandis has started, he picked a co-founder or two to help him get it off the ground. Now that he has more than 20 companies, for some of them, he may step back and serve as founder and chairman and then either promote a co-founder to CEO or hire one to run the company.", "Not one to rest on his laurels, Diamandis has his hands on many projects, including a new book he\u2019s working on with Tony Robbins. \u201cI\u2019m doing a lot,\u201d he admits, \u201cbut it\u2019s all driven by passion.\u201d", "As for work-life balance, for him, it doesn\u2019t exist. \u201cIt\u2019s more about work-life integration,\u201d he explains. \u201cI am \u2018on\u2019 24/7. I have two 7-year-old boys; I do my best to prioritize them, but there have been\u2026too many days away, and so there is, for sure, the trade of time.\u201d", "That trade-off is a familiar one for any entrepreneur trying to make a difference, big or small. \u201cI know some of the more successful Silicon Valley gazillionaires,\u201d says Diamandis, \u201cand it\u2019s brutal sometimes. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s living a life of meaning and a life of where you get to choose how you spend your time and the dent you want to leave on this planet.\u201d", "It\u2019s one thing to want to build a lifestyle business, one whose sole purpose is to make enough money to support the way you live, but it\u2019s quite another to want to build a business that changes the world.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a job, and I don\u2019t think of anything as a job. I\u2019ve always followed my passion, and at the end of the day, that\u2019s really the world that I feel extraordinarily lucky to live in, one where I am doing what I want to do and have turned my passions, dare I say my fantasy world into my professional world.", "I was born in New York, grew up, two parents were immigrants from Greece. My dad was a doctor, wanted me to become a doctor, went to medical school, but I really wanted to become an astronaut. I wanted to become a space enthusiast, I wanted to really open up the space frontier and consequently that was my focus. The Apollo programme, Star Trek, it showed me where the world was, where the world could go.", "While I ended up going to medical school to make my parents happy, I really after I graduated medical school, started starting companies. I started a university which is going great called the International Space University, a launch company, a satellite communications company, a company called Zero Gravity Corporation that flies people into weightlessness, the XPRIZE Foundation, Singularity University, a bunch of longevity companies. About 22 companies in total so far, but they\u2019ve all been, starting a company has been a way that I explore an area and really follow my passion.", "Nathan: Yeah, wow. That\u2019s incredible. So, 22 companies, and you\u2019ve done some incredible things. I\u2019m most familiar with your work around the XPRIZE Foundation, and so I could talk to you about a vast array of things, but what I\u2019m really curious around is just on that, a lot of founders, they have what you would call shiny object syndrome where you want to start a new company, you want to do this. How do you manage that? Because obviously you\u2019ve got a tonne of things going with 22 companies. Talk to me about that.", "Peter: Ultimately Nathan, it was a company at a time. My first company was actually a non-profit called Students for the Exploration and Development of Space, SEDS, that grew into the world\u2019s largest college space organisation around the world, with hundreds of chapters. But one thing led to another and I would typically start a company and hand it off to someone else. I don\u2019t serve as CEO really of more than a single company, but I might serve as founder and chairman, or executive chairman, and always make sure there\u2019s a great CEO that either was a co-founder with me or was hired to run the company.", "I think at the end of the day, it really is fundamentally about having a great leader, but pursuing a company is a passion for me. It\u2019s how I fulfil my dreams, my fantasies. It\u2019s my creative world.", "Nathan: The company that I guess you\u2019re active in growing is Celularity. Is that-", "Peter: Well, there\u2019s about five or six companies. Real quick, the XPRIZE Foundation I spend a good chunk of my time. I\u2019ve got an amazing CEO. I serve as executive chairman and founder at XPRIZE. Anousheh Ansari, who\u2019s started a few multibillion companies, was the first benefactor of my first XPRIZE for space flight. She\u2019s the CEO here now. Singularity University that I co-founded with Ray Kurzweil is up in the Bay Area, and SU is growing super fast.", "Rob Nail is the CEO there and I started as executive chairman, I serve as executive founder now. Celularity is a stem cell company that I co-founded with a dear friend, Bob Hariri. I serve as founder and vice chairman. Bob\u2019s the CEO and chairman. Human Longevity\u2019s another company, and I spend a lot of time with my Abundance community. Abundance 360 is my 400 person CEO event in Beverly Hills every year, and then I\u2019ve got a 3000 entrepreneur digital community that I coach every day, the Abundance Digital Group are folks who are probably like your podcast listeners.", "They\u2019re entrepreneurs, they\u2019re founders, they\u2019re trying to understand how to use exponential technologies, how to use crowdsourcing, how do they use crowdfunding, how do they find out their massively transformative purpose, and as a result of that, what their moonshots are. For me, it\u2019s about coaching entrepreneurs to go bigger, bolder, and I love sharing my passion, my vision of what I\u2019ve learned with people.", "Nathan: Yeah, so one thing that strikes me that\u2019s incredible about you, Peter, is you think so big. You collaborate with some incredible minds, like some of the greatest entrepreneurs of our generation. You\u2019re doing some incredible things with Singularity, or even your Abundance community, or Celularity, stem cell, you\u2019re doing really, really cutting edge things. I\u2019m just curious, what would you say to founders that are no where near thinking at your level. Do they have to be?", "Peter: At the end of the day, you have to be true to yourself and the most important thing you need to do as a founder of a company is know that you love what you\u2019re doing, and you\u2019re not doing it for your parents, for your friends, for your teacher, out of obligation, that you\u2019re doing it because it is what you love doing. Doing anything significant in the world is hard. If you don\u2019t love it, if you\u2019re not doing it from your emotional place of energy, you\u2019re going to give up before you succeed. So, for me, I\u2019ve always been a nine year old kid pursuing my dreams.", "Nathan: When it comes to pursuing your dreams, what most excites you right now that you\u2019re working on out of all the different projects?", "Peter: Oh, my goodness. That\u2019s a hard question. I have two boys, I have two seven year old kids and it\u2019s asking me, \u201cWhich of your kids do you like better?\u201d I\u2019ll tell you the answer. It\u2019s a hard one. Listen, I love my Abundance community, my Abundance Digital community, because for me it\u2019s a way of leveraging the world. These are 3000 entrepreneurs that are working to solve the world\u2019s biggest problems, and I teach that the world\u2019s biggest problems are the world\u2019s biggest business opportunities. If you want to become a billionaire, help a billion people. I mean, it\u2019s an amazing world we\u2019re living in there.", "I\u2019m very interested in the longevity space, the work that we\u2019re doing in the stem cell world. I think we have the ability to add 10, 20, 30 healthy years on everybody\u2019s life. So, I\u2019m writing my third book, actually my third and fourth book. One called Convergence, another one with Tony Robbins called Life Force, on longevity. I mean, I\u2019m doing a lot, but all driven by passion.", "Nathan: When it comes to your \u2026 Do you ever doubt yourself? Do you ever think, \u201cMaybe I can\u2019t do this?\u201d Because some of the things you\u2019re doing are just incredible feats, like driving humanity forward in many different ways.", "Peter: Of course. I mean, I\u2019m not insane. But it doesn\u2019t slow me down. Meaning I have to enter every conversation at every company with a belief that I can do it, that it can be done, that there\u2019s no, from a first principle thinking, that there\u2019s nothing stopping it from happening. It might be hard to raise the money, it might be hard to get access to what I need, but I don\u2019t need to invent antigravity or go faster than the speed of light. If I believe that it\u2019s a matter of some combination of luck and hard work, and getting the right people involved, then I\u2019m up for that.", "Of course, doing stuff that\u2019s easy after a while gets boring, and it\u2019s more a matter of how do I keep myself excited about life? How do I keep myself pushing and growing? A need for growth and contribution and variety, and stability.", "Nathan: One thing I think that is really, really important when it comes to building any kind of successful business is the team and the people that are surrounding you. One thing that I think must be the case for you is you must have incredible people that you attract on your journey for all these different companies that you\u2019re creating, driving humanity forward. I\u2019m curious what are things that you look for to create great talent and be a great leader to build an awesome team?", "Peter: So, yes, of course. There\u2019s no question that the only way I\u2019m able to do anything I\u2019m able to do is by having an amazing team and set of teams. I need first of all, extraordinary trust, and I need to believe in the team, so right now at XPRIZE and Singularity University and HI and Celularity and my venture fund, BOLD Capital, et cetera, I need to believe in that leader and trust them and support them.", "My job is to help them be a great CEO. I have a team of about a dozen millennials that are my personal team, my strike force so to speak, that work with me across everything I do. I go through a very difficult vetting process. We run a global competition sometimes to bring those people in, and then we go through a 60-90 day trial period and then the entire existing team has to vote them, so it\u2019s 100% acceptance.", "Nathan: Wow.", "Peter: It\u2019s a team of a dozen people that work with me, but one person who\u2019s out of whack can send the whole thing careening. So, it\u2019s really important that we operate as a team and I love my team. They take great care of me and my job is to take great care of them, and with them, we run Abundance Digital, we run Abundance 360, we support all my companies and it\u2019s my interior deployable resource. I am thankful for them.", "Nathan: What sort of traits and characteristics do you look for? Out of all your experience, what are some things that are most important to you when hiring an attracting great talent?", "Peter: That\u2019s a great question. Number one, I need to really like them. How do I say that? I\u2019m going to be spending a lot of time with them. If I don\u2019t like them, so I have a very interesting and simple metric. If when we\u2019re in the meeting, and that person is talking if I\u2019m like in the back of my mind saying, \u201cI wish this guy would shut up,\u201d that\u2019s not a good situation. On the other hand, if we\u2019re in a meeting and I say, \u201cListen, I haven\u2019t heard from you, I really want to hear your thoughts,\u201d that\u2019s a good situation.", "I need to respect them and want to hear what they have to say. I don\u2019t respect people who don\u2019t work hard. Not all the time, but work smart, work hard, are passionate, are driven, have a clear vision of where they want to go. Don\u2019t suffer assholes or fools, and at the end of the day, I will bend over backwards and support my team any way I can. They do the same for me. When you\u2019ve got that, I\u2019m often saying I could run a small country if I needed to with my dozen.", "Nathan: Are you doing any kind of tests? Guy like you, you must do Myers\u2013Briggs or DISC profiling. Do you do stuff like that?", "Peter: We do some. We do one programme called Kolbe, K-O-L-B-E, but it\u2019s more the interviewing of the team with these individuals. By the way, a third of the people who come in don\u2019t cut it. We\u2019ll say goodbye, but yeah, I tell entrepreneurs all the time, finding your founder or co-founder or CEO or partner is really tough. The mindset that you guys need to have needs to be similar enough that you\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time with this person, and you really have to respect them, appreciate them, want to spend time with them. You can be lucky, but it\u2019s better to have experience.", "Nathan: Do you believe you always should start off with a co-founder?", "Peter: I do. Every company I\u2019ve ever done has had somebody as a partner, as a thought partner if nothing else. It depends where you are in your career process, but I\u2019ve always had a co-founder, either one co-founder or two co-founders. I mean, especially trying to for some type of big and crazy idea.", "Nathan: I\u2019d love to hear your \u2026 I know you wrote a whole book on this, but can you tell us around everything you\u2019re doing with Abundance and Abundance University, and the whole premise of the book?", "Peter: Yeah, sure. Happily. I wrote a book called Abundance, came out in January, 2012. I gave the opening keynote at TED that year on the topic, and it was at the top of the New York Times and I was very proud, and it was a basic, a bit flip, a mindset change. The realisation is that technology is a force that takes whatever used to be scarce and makes it abundant over and over again. There are countless examples.", "Energy is a perfect example. We used to go and kill whales to get oil, to light the nights, and we ravaged mountainsides to get coal, and we drilled kilometres into the ocean floor to get oil. But the reality is that the sun is bathed in 8000 times more energy from the sun than we consume as a species in a year. There is a squanderable abundance of energy. The same thing is true for water. We just awarded the water abundance XPRIZE that is able to pull 2000 litres of water out of the atmosphere, two cents a litre of renewable energy.", "Education, healthcare, will eventually through AI be effectively free and available everywhere. We\u2019re discovering resources left, right, and centre. When you look at it, global has made access to knowledge massively abundant. Autonomous electric cars will transform transport, making it five times cheaper to have cars as a service than owning a car.", "We\u2019re living in a world where there\u2019s nothing that truly is scarce. Even diamonds that De Beers would teach us are scarce, there\u2019s a company called the Diamond Foundry that a friend of mine runs, that has methane, water, and carbon in one end, and perfect diamonds come out the other end. It\u2019s a thought mindset, right? I believe that we\u2019re heading towards a world where we can uplift every man, woman, and child on this planet, really creating a world of abundance.", "On the basis of that, and then the work I do in exponentials, back in 2000 and let\u2019s see \u2026 Seven years ago. 2012, thereabouts, I founded something called Abundance 360. It\u2019s a 400 person CEO event. I made a commitment, Nathan, to run a programme for 25 years\u2019 time. Every January, for 25 years, we get together in Beverly Hills. It\u2019s three days, this year we\u2019re going deep on all the exponential technologies and how they\u2019re transforming industries. When that sells out a year in advance, we ended up creating a digital community called Abundance Digital, and it\u2019s about 3000 entrepreneurs.", "We are every day, focusing on what\u2019s the technology that\u2019s transforming scarcity to abundance? Where do we see exponential technologies impacting companies, marketplaces? It\u2019s really the place where I spend a lot of my time in conversation. We do about four monthly webinars with community members, and my job is help them, inspire to think bigger, and to change the world.", "Any of your listeners by the way, who are interested, Nathan, it\u2019s AbundanceDigital.info, and at the end of the year, we just with a few individuals, we provided a code, it\u2019s normally 1500 bucks, we\u2019re running a 40% discount at the end of the year, so if anybody who is interested could use a code of just foundr40 to get 40% off of Abundance Digital.", "Nathan: We have to work towards wrapping up because I\u2019m super mindful of your time, and I could talk to you all day about this stuff, man, but at what point should founders be thinking about these emerging technologies? Should people when they\u2019re thinking of, you said something interesting before, if you want to build a billion dollar business, you have to be prepared to serve at least a billion people, a lot of people are not thinking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the next thing? What\u2019s the next thing?\u201d They\u2019re just looking at the now. Is that a forward thought process of building a business?", "Peter: So, listen, I think that at the end of the day, people have to understand why they\u2019re building their business. If you\u2019re just trying to build a business to make money, I view that as an empty pursuit and when it gets hard, you don\u2019t have the emotional energy to push through and succeed. For me, the most important thing, I discuss this a lot with my Abundance Digital members is, \u201cWhat\u2019s your massively transformative purpose? What is it that keeps you going? Who do you want to be a hero to? What is the problems you want to solve? What is the dent you want to make in the universe? What is it at the end of this, even if you don\u2019t succeed, you have spent your time in a way that has transformed people\u2019s lives?\u201d", "I think that is really critically important and the technologies today, the exponential technologies of computers, sensors, networks, AI, robotics, 3D printing, synthetic biology, augmented, virtual reality, blockchain, all those technologies are what allow you to operate at scale and make a difference. So, as an entrepreneur, you can choose to work hard 40 hours a week or seven days a week, and impact 100 people, or you can work those same hours and impact a million people. It\u2019s your choice.", "The tools we have to impact the world are extraordinary. Everyone of us have access to more knowledge and information on Google and Baidu than the heads of countries had 20 years ago. Everyone of us has the ability to spin up 1000 processor cores on Amazon Web or Google Cloud, or gain access to 3D printing on the cloud, or quantum computers on the cloud, or whatever expertise you need. We\u2019re self-limiting in that regard. My job is to help people understand how big a game they can play.", "Nathan: I think the game that you\u2019re playing is incredibly high, and I think people that are listening to this right now would be walking away just being really challenged of, \u201cHow can I think bigger and have this abundance mindset that you speak of?\u201d So, I\u2019m curious, what\u2019s the dent that you want to make that you leave the world with?", "Peter: That\u2019s a great question, Nathan. I talk about the notion of you should being with one empty P, one massively transformative purpose. Then, there you can add on an additional one. I\u2019m pretty advanced in my entrepreneurial career, having done a number of these. My earliest MTP, massively transformative purpose, was really opening up space. I have started with or co-founded what is arguably one of the leading space universities in the world, and Zero G and Space Adventures, and the XPRIZE, and so forth. I\u2019ve known Elon for a better part of 20 years, and Jeff Bezos for nearly 35 years.", "At the end of the day, how do you really open up the space frontier for humanity? That\u2019s the first one, and I spend a lot of my energy and time focusing and thinking on those. The second is extending the healthy human lifespan. How do you add 20 or 30 healthy years in a person\u2019s life? I\u2019ve got three companies in that arena.", "Then, the fourth one, which is really the work I do with the Abundance community, the XPRIZE Foundation, Singularity University, is around the idea of solving the world\u2019s biggest problems. How do I empower entrepreneurs to really go big, to change the world, to solve the world\u2019s biggest problems? That\u2019s a passion for me.", "Nathan: Amazing. Well look, two last questions before we wrap up. You\u2019ve done some incredible things thus far in your life, what have been the sacrifices that you\u2019ve had to make to get where you are today? What have you had to give up? Because I think this journey that founders are on, it\u2019s always refreshing to hear about the hard times and then, the last thing is where\u2019s the best place people can find out more about yourself and your work? You mentioned Abundance community, but would you like to share your latest books that are coming out, or anything at all?", "Peter: Yeah. The first is there\u2019s no question, the style of my life is not, there\u2019s no balance in my life. It\u2019s more about work/life integration. I am on 24/7, I have two seven year old boys, I do my best to prioritise them, but there have been too many red eyes and too many days away. So, there is for sure the trade of time that we have. That is you\u2019re trading sleep and ultimately to some degree, you\u2019re trading health.", "Nothing in this comes for free. I know some of the more successful Silicon Valley gazillionaires, and it\u2019s brutal sometimes. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s living a life of meaning and a life where you get to choose how you spend your time and the dent you want to leave on this planet. For me, if folks are interested, they can learn more about my Abundance community at AbundanceDigital.info. They can learn, get access to my blogs at Diamandis.com. XPRIZE.org is the organisation I use to run global competitions and then SU.org is Singularity University. But I think AbundanceDigital.info and Diamandis.com is a good starting point.", "Nathan: Amazing. Well look, Peter, thank you so much for your time and everything you do. I\u2019ve walked away with this conversation incredibly inspired and challenged for the work that we do at foundr, and yeah, really pushed my mindset and I\u2019m sure countless others forward from listening to this, so thank you so much for your time and yeah, I really appreciate it.

They understand the patterns and progression of history, and can interpret current events and trends with rare wisdom and insight. Seth Godin is one such person. You might say that his knowledge about the world of business borders on the prophetic. You could also safely say Seth Godin is a man who sees the world not for what it is, but for what it could be. He\u2019s in the business of change: predicting it, implementing it, and watching it unfold.", "It\u2019s not hard to find remarkable things to say about Seth Godin. You\u2019ve seen his TED talks, his books, his blog, his podcast; he\u2019s one of those characters who\u2019s grounded, yet somehow still larger than life. For those late to the Godin party, he\u2019s a marketing guru, founder of Squidoo.com and world-renowned author of 17 business bestsellers including Linchpin, Unleashing the Ideavirus, Tribes, and Purple Cow. For a man who understands tribes, he has proved time and again that he can walk the talk, building, in the process, a legion of raving fans \u2013 people who thrive on his palatable blend of business and sociology.", "Godin preaches a large-scale rejection of homogenised dreams, and a new way of engaging with the world. Many of his writings revolve around the idea that the current system of work, marketing and education, is not so much broken, but was perfectly engineered for a past age.", "To really understand where we are, we need to know how we got here.", " \u201cWe evolved culturally, and probably physically, to understand that obeying people in power was a good idea,\u201d he says. Walking us through some ancient history, Godin explains that toeing the line was essential to Neolithic humans, as disobedience to tribal authority probably meant removal from the tribe and ultimately, danger.", "It\u2019s fair to say the program to obey has been with us from the start, making us all proverbial cogs in the wheel. \u201cThe first public school in the US was started by Horace Mann in Massachusetts,\u201d Godin says, explaining its founding was based on industry\u2019s need for masses of compliant workers. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t find enough people who were willing to stand or sit in a dark factory for 10 or 12 hours a day and do what they were told. So we invented public school to train people to be obedient. The school you went to, and the school I went to, is optimised to create obedient cogs in a productive factory setting.\u201d And in terms of fostering industrial change two centuries ago, \u201cthat was really important. For a really long time.\u201d", "Since we\u2019re conditioned to be part of an obedient, cohesive mass from an early age, many of our expectations of work spring from an understandable, but now anachronistic, view of how life should be. \u201cNow that individuals like you and I can do the work we care about without a job, and without a boss, we shouldn\u2019t be teaching every single kid how to be \u2018normal\u2019,\u201d Godin says. \u201cWe should be teaching kids two things: how to solve interesting problems, and how to lead.\u201d", "In a world of fairly arid business environments, Godin\u2019s work is rich and refreshing. Focus on your differences. Be weird. Do work that matters.", " And smiling from behind buttery-yellow framed glasses, you can see the man practises what he preaches.", "Initially hailing from Mount Vernon, New York, Godin attended Williamsville East High School, where he found himself at odds with traditional structures and authorities right from the start. \u201cIn my yearbook,\u201d he recalls, \u201cmy English teacher wrote that I was the bane of her existence, and that I would never, ever amount to anything.\u201d Such a glowing recommendation did nothing to convince him of the value of traditional schooling.", "Growing up as an avid science fiction fan might explain why Godin is insistent about pushing society forward. \u201cI read a lot of science fiction, growing up, about changing things.\u201d That Isaac Asimov, the godfather of science fiction, was a personal friend of his, comes as no surprise.", "Small business always beckoned. Drawn to entrepreneurialism from an early age, he started his first \u201clittle company\u201d at 14. \u201cWhen I was 16, I had my first real company. And when I was in college, I co-founded the largest student-run business in the US. And each of those things was never about \u2018how do I make money doing something?\u2019; it was \u2018how do I find enough resources to do a project that I\u2019m interested in?\u2019\u201d Words that have since become his M.O.", "While completing his MBA at Stanford, it was at Spinnaker Software where, as brand manager back in 1983, Godin cut his marketing teeth. As one of his few \u2018real\u2019 jobs to date, you\u2019d think working for The Man in an office would have been something akin to torture. But Godin fondly refers to his time at Spinnaker as \u201ca revelation\u201d, saying, \u201cI worked with truly amazing people. The co-founders gave me an enormous amount of trust as well as pushing me to lead.\u201d Godin wasn\u2019t the only one to benefit. His Spinnaker co-workers have ended up running significant portions of Apple, Columbia-TriStar, and McAfee, to name but a few. As such, Godin\u2019s story of breaking out of the cage is rather gentler than you\u2019d expect. \u201cIn 1986, I left to move to NY in order to get married.\u201d Unable to find a Spinnaker equivalent in New York, Godin started Seth Godin Productions, a book-packaging outfit.", "Even for Seth Godin, those first few years of going it alone were rocky. \u201cI had no idea how long a slog it was going to be,\u201d he says. But with several years of being \u201can inventor and a builder,\u201d he readily developed a customer base \u201cthat were eager to hear what people like me had to say\u201d.", "\u201cI haven\u2019t had a job since 1999,\u201d he says, referring to his time as Yahoo\u2019s VP of direct marketing. \u201cAnd before that I hadn\u2019t had one since \u201986. I think that focusing on doing the work instead of having a job is a key part of being an entrepreneur.\u201d", "It seems fitting that his success came from \u201ctrying hard to not have a job or please any superiors\u201d. Godin first started turning the world of marketing on its head when founding Yoyodyne in 1995. Annoyed with outdated \u2018interruption marketing\u2019 models, he pioneered the idea of marketing companies to users, with contests, online games, and scavenger hunts. With this \u2013 which he sold to Yahoo! for a cool $30 million in 1998 \u2013 and later community web platform Squidoo, he cemented his reputation as an innovator, disruptor and chronic ruffler of feathers.", "But just to set the record straight, Godin isn\u2019t anti-jobs or anti-employment. You can challenge existing norms without a resignation letter. To Godin, it\u2019s all in the approach. \u201cEven if you\u2019re working for someone, you don\u2019t have to act as if it\u2019s a job. A job is where you try to please someone who tells you what to do, and that person usually wants you to do what you did yesterday, but a little faster, and a little cheaper. Whereas impresarios, and people who make projects, are playing by a completely different set of rules.\u201d", "It begs the question, if you do go it alone, what\u2019s the best way to create a successful start-up? Is it a matter of needing money to make money? Apparently not. \u201cI\u2019ve written down a lot of what I know about starting a business with no money, which is my favourite kind of business to start.\u201d He outlines his approach further in his free ebook, The Bootstrapper\u2019s Bible. \u201cThe secret of starting a business with no money is to make a service or a product that your customers want so much that they will pay you for it in advance. The idea is, you go to a big corporation, and say, \u2018If I could do this, and save you $50,000, will you pay me $10,000?\u2019 And most of them, if they believe you, will say \u2018yes\u2019. The key lies in identifying a problem, and a scalable approach to solving it.\u201d", "Stop us if you\u2019ve heard this analogy before. Odds are, you haven\u2019t. Godin presses us to imagine a marketing campaign as a waiter at a restaurant. Now imagine it\u2019s \u201cspam-filled, interruption-oriented, filled with promises it doesn\u2019t keep, selfish, aggressive, bullying, hoping a few people are silly enough to be lured into it.\u201d If you had a waiter like that, would you give them a tip? Probably not. But, Godin argues, \u201cwhen we have a waiter who is kind and clear, who puts in an effort, is aware of what we need, shows up when we need, guides us to the next thing that delights us, that person gets a 25% tip, and for good reason.\u201d Flipping traditional models of marketing and advertising on their heads, he argues that it\u2019s more akin to a service. And according to Godin, it\u2019s a service that\u2019s simple to get right, but sadly, that\u2019s often the exception rather than the rule.", "As a marketer, poor marketing hits a sore spot for Godin. You might say poor marketing methods (including all variants of interruption marketing) helped create Seth Godin. Much of his life\u2019s work has been spent advocating its antithesis. One of his first works was a scathing attack on interruption marketing, and it made waves because many companies hadn\u2019t considered there was an alternative.", "The idea of shipping a new product can strike fear into the heart of entrepreneurs young and old. However, Godin argues shipping need not be the anxiety-inducing struggle many find it to be. \u201cStart shipping a small amount of work and start putting ideas into the world,\u201d he says. \u201cWatch them morph and grow and change people.\u201d He argues against the go-big-or-go-home mentality prevalent in some start-up circles, instead advising aspiring business people to \u201cstart small, and start now.\u201d According to Godin, that means do something that someone will pay you $5 for. \u201cPut an idea into the world that someone will respond to. Aim to create something that will delight your customer.\u201d Does that mean your product needs to be perfect? \u201cThere is no perfect,\u201d he says. \u201cYour product will never be perfect and there will never be a perfect time to ship it. The work of the professional is shipping,\u201d he says. \u201cThe professional doesn\u2019t wait around for perfect.\u201d And just to clarify, that doesn\u2019t mean rushing, either. \u201cIf you are saying, \u2018Oh, what the hell,\u2019 and put it out there, you are hiding,\u201d Godin says, asserting that instead, the bolder and more professional outlook is: \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot at stake here, this is magical, but I can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d", "At one point during the interview, we accuse him of having something akin to the Midas touch. Did everything he attempt always turn to gold? He pulls us up short. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear. I\u2019ve built even more unsuccessful businesses . And I think one of the things success takes is a willingness to build an unsuccessful business.\u201d Even if you\u2019re setting out to disrupt a market, the message is clear: fail and fail again, until you don\u2019t. Godin emphasises that it\u2019s the willingness to take risks, and bring certain truths to the marketplace, that delivers an edge. \u201cIf you care about the project, and you care about the customer, you will not dilute your work, and that ironically will make your work more likely to catch someone\u2019s attention.\u201d", "\u201cNo one is going to be the next Seth Godin,\u201d he asserts, \u201cand no one wants to be the next Seth Godin. But there is plenty of room for the next you, because we need you \u2013 a different person \u2013 to stand up, and say, \u2018Here, I made this.\u2019 Those doors aren\u2019t going to be open forever, but they\u2019re open right now, and I just don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t walk through them.\u201d", "No one needs to be \u2018normal\u2019 anymore, he reassures us. \u201cIf you want to sing, sing. If you want to talk, talk. Here\u2019s a microphone. And the people who aren\u2019t grabbing the microphone are hiding. I think almost everyone has some generosity in them, some insight in them, some idea or notion or concept that would make the world better if they shared it. And if we can just shift our posture to one of generosity, I think we\u2019ll see an enormous step forward.\u201d Now there\u2019s a disruptive thought.", "It\u2019s your turn. These 5 steps have worked well for Seth Godin \u2013 so, disrupt, disobey, and create your own change!", "Nathan: Hello, and welcome to the Foundr Podcast. My name is Nathan Chan and I am your host coming to you live from Melbourne, Australia. Thank you again for joining me for another episode of the Foundr Podcast. You guys are in for an absolute treat because this episode, I bring you one of my all-time favorite marketers, idols. And this guy is just an absolute beast. Like, I love his work so much.", "And ever since I became an entrepreneur who, you know, got into this whole entrepreneurship thing about two and a half years ago, I\u2019d never heard of Seth and I didn\u2019t really know his work but once I started getting into the scene and really hearing about his work, reading it, and learning from it, and ", "reading a lot of his books", ", and reading it, you know, signing up to his mailing list and reading all his blog posts and stuff like that. I\u2019ve learnt so much and I\u2026when this guy speaks, I take it very, very seriously, and I\u2019m always listening. And I\u2019m always watching what he\u2019s doing because he\u2019s a true innovator, true marketer, and entrepreneur.", "So, I\u2019m really, really pumped to share this conversation with you. Funny little story is I pitched Seth like a Friday night. It was like a Friday night, pitched him at 11:30, and then I woke up to his reply saying, \u201cHey, can you do this in half an hour from now?\u201d And it was like 7 a.m. or 8 a.m., and I was just like freaking out. And I was like, \u201cOh my God,\u201d because this guy is like one of my idols and, yeah, I just rolled with it and jumped on Skype and it was an amazing conversation. It was a really\u2026yeah, for me, it was a really big win to finally speak with Seth. I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d get back to me so fast. And he\u2019s just a really generous guy with his time and, yeah, I actually went out to one of my favorite restaurants to celebrate with my family because it is a big win for the magazine, it\u2019s a big win for the brand, and big win for me and my own development.", "So, yeah, without further ado, here is the conversation with Seth Godin. We go through what it means to start small, start now, how do you know when to ship a project, how do you know how to ", "market a product", ". Seth gives us some serious gold on marketing and ", "validating your idea", ". And also, what I really, really liked is he talked about the education model and why you shouldn\u2019t do what you\u2019re told. And he talks about his latest book as well. We talk about that just briefly. Now, if you do want a copy of Seth\u2019s latest book, to buy them\u2026I had to buy them in bulk. So, I have a couple spare extra copies. The first two people to get in touch with me and leave a review for the podcast and the magazine and send it to me and send me an email, ", "[email\u00a0protected]", ", I will send you his hard copy book. I\u2019ve got two here, love to send it to you guys. It\u2019s a brilliant book, amazingly designed, really, really cool. It\u2019s just like a really nice book to have on your coffee table too. So, yeah, please hit me up. I\u2019d love to hear from you. If you are enjoying this episodes, you know, please do leave us a review even though if you don\u2019t want the book, it helps more than you can imagine. All right. That\u2019s enough rambling from me. Let\u2019s jump in. Can you tell us about just quickly how you got your job?", "Seth: Well, I\u2019ve worked extraordinarily hard not to have a job and I haven\u2019t had a job since 1999 and before that, I hadn\u2019t had one since \u201986. And I think that focusing on doing the work instead of having a job is a key part of being an entrepreneur.", "Nathan: And what triggered that change in 1996?", "Seth: It was \u201986.", "Nathan: 86\u2032, geez.", "Seth: So, when I was 14, I started my little company, and when I was 16, I had my first real company. And when I was in college, I cofounded the largest student-run business in the US. And each of those things was never about how do I make money doing something? It was how do I find enough resources to do a project that I\u2019m interested in? How do I be able to put on a show that I care about? And if there\u2019s a business component to it, that\u2019s fine. But for me, the work has always been to do a project. And sometimes those projects can be amplified by working for someone, but even if you\u2019re working for someone, you don\u2019t have to act as if it\u2019s a job. A job is where you try to please someone who tells you what to do and that person usually wants you to do what you did yesterday but a little faster and a little cheaper. Whereas impresarios and people who make projects are playing by completely different set of rules.", "Nathan: So let\u2019s talk about stealing dreams and your concept of that. Can you tell us a little bit more about that?", "Seth: Well, you know, the thing that enabled the world as we know it, including the fact that you and I are 10,000 miles apart and having a conversation for free is industrialism. Industrialism is the idea that large organizations profit by getting bigger by hiring efficient productive workers who do what they\u2019re told. And the magic of industrialization, which has been around for 200 years or so, is that it enabled large, large numbers of people to go from being subsistence farmers to being in the middle class. And it\u2019s magical.", "But the challenge was, there weren\u2019t enough factory workers. They couldn\u2019t find enough people who were willing to stand or sit in a dark factory for 10 or 12 hours a day and do what they were told. So, we invented public schools to train people to be obedient. I\u2019m not making this up. That\u2019s actually its function. The first public school in the United States was in Massachusetts and Horace Mann, the guy who started it quickly ran out of teachers. So, he needed to start a school to train women to be teachers. And do you know what he called this school? He called it The Normal School because the goal was to teach women to teach kids to be normal.", "So, school, the school you went to and the school I went to, is optimized to create obedient cards in a productive factory setting. And that was really important for a really long time. But now that these platforms exist, now that individuals like you and I can do the work we care about without a job and without a boss, we shouldn\u2019t be teaching every single kid how to be normal. We should be teaching kids two things, how to solve interesting problems and how to lead. And if we have more of that, I think we\u2019re gonna see our culture accelerate. So I wrote a manifesto about this called \u201cStop Stealing Dreams.\u201d It\u2019s free on the internet.com and I also did a TEDx talk-about for those who don\u2019t wanna read it.", "Nathan: Yeah, I know. It was extremely captivating. And, you know, we\u2019ve all had this thing planted in our mind that ever since you were little, you go to school, you get good grades, and you get a job, and you buy a house. And we\u2019re all used to that security. And I really love your latest book. It\u2019s quite different to what you\u2019ve usually done. It\u2019s got beautiful artwork and it\u2019s called, \u201cYour Turn.\u201d Can you tell us about why people waiting to be picked. Why do you think that is? Why are we used to this security of a nine to five job?", "Seth: Well, part of it goes back to 200,000 or so years. If you lived in a tribe, a Neanderthal or Neolithic human walking around the steps of eastern Europe or northern Africa, there was a chief. And if you offended the chief, if you spoke up too much, they were gonna throw you out. And if you got thrown out, you would be eaten by a lion and you would have no grandchildren to pass your genes on to. So we evolved culturally and probably physically to understand that obeying people in power was a good idea. And this was certainly compounded by public school, compounded by the industrial age.", "You know, if you start insulting Henry Ford, Henry Ford is gonna kick you off the factory floor and you\u2019re not gonna have a job anymore. And so, being picked, which is amplified by television, by government, by celebrity culture is something that we seek. One study that I can\u2019t believe is true but is, researcher talked to thousands and thousands of high school students and he gave them a choice of five jobs they could aspire to when they grew up including Supreme Court Justice, senator, successful entrepreneur.", "But far and a way, the job that was the most popular among 17-year-olds was assistant to a celebrity. Not even celebrity, assistant to a celebrity. Because if you are the assistant to a celebrity, it means someone picked you. It means you have proximity to fame without any of the fear or risk of fame. And so it goes really deep. And entrepreneurs are infected with this and they think that their win is getting picked. And if we talk about apps, and I know you have an interest in this, you know, the challenge with the app store is that there are millions of apps in there.", "Last year, the app infrastructure paid more money to app developers than Hollywood earned from all the movies they make. That sounds like a big number except for the fact that Hollywood releases about 400 movies a year and there\u2019s millions and millions of apps. So, it\u2019s a little bit of a circus game especially if you think that the only way your app is gonna work is if Apple picks you to be on the front page of the ITunes Store. Because if your whole mindset is, \u201cI better get picked by Apple,\u201d you\u2019re gonna lose, because the odds of getting picked by Apple are about the odds of getting drafted to play in the NBA.", "Nathan: Yeah, look, you know, it\u2019s actually funny because we\u2026this is a funny story. We actually, we were picked by Apple. I never expected it. And they asked this for promotional cover like promotional artwork and they never got back to me. How strange is that? I don\u2019t mind. Like, we don\u2019t need to be picked. Question, what would you like to say to anyone listening to this that is sitting on the fence that has, you know, an idea around a business or a project or a problem that they\u2019re really passionate about? What would you say to someone standing on the fence right now?", "Seth: Well, it\u2019s gonna surprise you. The first two things I would say are, \u201cI don\u2019t care about your passion and I don\u2019t care your idea,\u201d that, these are myths that hold us back. You do not\u00a0 need to be passionate about your idea and your idea does not need to be good one. What you need is thirst. You need to be a thirsty human who is intent on learning and shipping. That, the idea is not go big or stay home, the idea is to start small and start now. And that means do something that someone will pay you $5 for. Put an idea into the world that someone will respond to. Find someone who needs your help and help them. That if you start shipping this small amount of work, if you start putting ideas into the world and watching them morph and grow and change people, you will cease to be afraid and you will stop looking for the perfect idea and you will stop waiting to be super passionate. That the professional does the work of shipping stuff and doesn\u2019t wait around for perfect. That good is more than good enough if you can get into this game and be professional at it and then keep playing.", "Nathan: When you talk about shipping, you have a very high quality, high standard of work. I\u2019ve had some friends that have done your internships and they\u2019ve told me about how hard you push them and how hard your standard is. How do you know when good is good enough and when to ship?", "Seth: Well, let\u2019s agree that perfect is silly because nothing that you admire is perfect. There\u2019s no electronic device, there\u2019s no hotel, there\u2019s no steak at a restaurant that has ever been perfect. So we\u2019re not going to seek to be flawless. The definition of good enough is it\u2019s good enough for the customer to be delighted enough to talk about it, delighted enough to come back for more, delighted enough to miss it when it\u2019s gone. So good enough doesn\u2019t mean junk. Good enough doesn\u2019t mean what the hell. Good enough is actually a huge standard. It says, would the person I\u2019m offering this to missed it if I didn\u2019t make it? And most people don\u2019t meet that standard. So I wanted to just make it clear, if you are sitting there saying, \u201cI can\u2019t ship because it\u2019s not perfect,\u201d you\u2019re hiding. But if you were saying, \u201cOh, what the hell?\u201d and put it out there, you\u2019re also hiding. That the place of not hiding is, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of stake here. This is magical but I can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d", "Nathan: And that\u2019s great. Few more questions around you. You\u2019re stating a lot of facts. I\u2019ve always curious to know who do you learn from and who influences a lot of your decisions, you know, where you have all your projects and ideas and everything that you work on.", "Seth: Well, let\u2019s think. I\u2019m most inspired by my readers, most inspired by people like you who show up and do something that never occurred to me and do it consistently even in the face of a stumble or two. Well, who do I learn from? I read, you know, a few 100 books a year. I don\u2019t have to finish them. I just read until I get the point. I read hundreds of blogs a day. And in terms of facts, 66% of the time I make them up.", "Nathan: Are there any game changing notable resources that\u2019s really impacted you? You always talk about Zig Ziglar. Is there anyone else?", "Seth: Oh, I think there\u2019s 100. I also talk often about Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n, I talk about Krista Tippett and her podcast which is so powerful. I talk about my friend Tom Peters, who I knew and have known for a long time. Jay Levinson, who I was lucky enough to bring into the world of book packaging. I did a bunch of books with him. People like Amanda Palmer, her new book is really something. Jackie Huber has written a couple great books. Bernadette Jiwa, J-I-W-A, who is from Perth but is moving to Melbourne soon. Her blog is fabulous and so are her books. Pam Slim has written some great books. The work of early digestible science fiction from Neal Stephenson. My friend Isaac Asimov who I knew years ago before he died. I\u2019ve read a lot of science fiction growing up that changes things. Cory Doctorow, just by himself, reading Cory Doctorow is sufficient for somebody to be inspired on a regular basis. So, there\u2019s a quite a long list and I try to name-check people as often as I can.", "Nathan: Yeah. So, you\u2019re always meeting people and you\u2019re always consuming stuff. I\u2019m curious, can you give us an insight, because I did not expect you to just jump on a call with me that quickly. You know, what does Seth Godin\u2019s day look like? What are you working on right now and how do you manage your time?", "Seth: I work super hard not to have a typical day. The consistent things are I don\u2019t watch television and I don\u2019t go to meetings. And those two decisions save me 8 to 10 hours a day. So that\u2019s 8 to 10 hours a day I have that most people don\u2019t have. And I strongly recommend you try it. And other than that, the goal is to do this work that\u2019s worth doing and sometimes it means locking myself up in a room with no destructions, and other times it means talking to people who are working on interesting projects. I give probably 30 or 40 speeches a year. I go on a few seminars on my own. We\u2019re getting ready for one in March now that sold out today. So, it\u2019s a mixture on purpose. You know, I\u2019m super lucky that the internet likes people with ADD because if it hadn\u2019t shown up, I would have been in really big trouble.", "Nathan: Yeah, you mentioned the internet and I always tell people this, like, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to start something, now is the time.\u201d The internet has changed the game. It changed the playing field, right? And you say it all the time, you know, anyone with a voice can have one now.", "Seth: Yeah, if you wanna sing, sing. If you wanna talk, talk. Here\u2019s the microphone. And the people who aren\u2019t grabbing the microphone are hiding. And I think almost everyone has some generosity in them, some insight in them, some idea or notion or concept that would make the world better if they shared it. And if we can just shift our posture to one of generosity, I think we\u2019ll see an enormous step forward.", "Nathan: Let\u2019s switch gears and talk about the ", "Acumen Fund", ". Can you tell me why that is so important to you?", "Seth: Sure. I think the Acumen Fund is one of the philanthropies that is working to change the endless emergency of poverty. So let me decode that sentence. Poverty is a very effective way to raise money in the short run. You know, \u201cGive us some money or this kid will die.\u201d That idea of a bag of rice to a hungry person, is at the heart of what made a philanthropist 10,000 years ago. The problem with that approach is, in a world of more than 7 billion people, you\u2019re always gonna be short. And instead, what we\u2019re looking for is a scalable solution so that once and for all, we live in a planet where everybody has enough.", "And I think the way we get there is the same way that Howard Schultz solved the coffee shortage in the United States. That, there used to be no Starbucks and now there\u2019s more than 10,000 Starbucks. How did that happen? Did he do a fundraiser and then build a lot of Starbucks? No. Every time he built a Starbucks, he makes enough money to build another Starbucks because Starbucks pay for themselves. So the idea of Acumen is to invest in entrepreneurs who will build\u00a0 businesses that do business with the poor in a way that makes the poor better off and makes enough of a profit that they can do it again. Because the way markets work is no one engages in a transaction if it doesn\u2019t help them. So, if you buy a coffee for $3 it\u2019s because you think it\u2019s worth $4, not because you\u2019re doing them a favor.", "So some of the companies that Acumen has funded include VisionSpring which sells reading glasses to people in remote villages who are in their 50s and can\u2019t see anymore. If you buy a pair of reading glassed for $3, it will pay for itself in two days and VisionSpring will make enough money to go sell somebody else a pair of reading glasses. Or D.Light, which is selling solar lanterns that replace kerosene which is dangerous and expensive and dirty. Or A to Z which is a factory in Tanzania that makes malaria bed nets so that not only is it enriching the community, it\u2019s saving millions of people from dying from malaria. Or Ecotact, a company in Kenya that runs pay toilets in places where there is no alternative.", "So, you can either poop in the street, or you can have your dignity for a shilling. And they can use the money from a successful Ecotact to open another one. And so if you get any of these businesses right, what you end up doing is solving the problem because they will keep scaling until there\u2019s no one left and that\u2019s the magic of commerce, right? Is that businesses grow until they can\u2019t grow anymore. And the other reason that I\u2019m fascinated with Acumen is that Jacqueline Novogratz, the woman who founded it, is an extraordinary human being who brings her whole self to this mission and does it with such clarity of purpose that it inspires me everyday.", "Nathan: Yeah, I know it\u2019s\u2026I\u2019ve done it a lot from you and it\u2019s some brilliant cause.", "Seth: Well, thank you.", "Nathan: Let\u2019s talk about what it takes to build a successful business. You\u2019ve built quite a few. It\u2019s something you\u2019ve done many times in your career. What does it take?", "Seth: Well, let\u2019s be clear, I\u2019ve also built even more unsuccessful businesses\u2026", "Nathan: Yeah, that too. Yes, you mention that a lot.", "Seth: And I think that one of the things it takes is the willingness to build an unsuccessful business. That if you have to succeed, you\u2019ll probably fail because you\u2019re competing against everyone else who has to succeed. And like them, you\u2019re not willing to take certain risks or bring certain truths to the marketplace. But, if you care about the project and you care about the customer, you will not dilute your work and that, ironically, will make your work more likely to catch someone\u2019s attention.", "I\u2019ve written down a lot of what I know about starting a business with no money which is my favorite kind of business to start. And people can find it by searching for \u201cThe Bootstrapper\u2019s Bible\u201d online. It\u2019s free. But basically, I think that secret of starting a business with no money is to make a service or a product that your customers want so much that they will pay you for it in advance, which is a little bit like Kickstarter, right? But, the idea is if you go to a big corporation say, \u201cIf I could do this and save you $50,000, will you pay me $10,000?\u201d And most of them if they believe you will say yes. And so now, you\u2019ve identified a problem, you\u2019ve identified a scalable approach to solving it. You bring resources to bear, repeatedly solve the problem as you scale. That\u2019s very different than the mindset of, \u201cLet\u2019s raise $36 million in Silicon Valley and serve everyone free lunch for a year and then we\u2019ll come out with something that will get us on the cover of Time Magazine.\u201d", "Nathan: Let\u2019s also talk about marketing. You know, you\u2019re one of my favorite marketers. I learn so much from you. Can you just tell me like\u2026there\u2019s something you mentioned there about caring. To me, that\u2019s something that people will notice that subconsciously if you care. And it\u2019s not necessarily a tactic but in essence, it can be too. Like, just, you know, it\u2019s caring. What are some basics around good marketing and somebody that wants to get better at their marketing with their business?", "Seth: Well, here\u2019s a good experiment that you might wanna try. I\u2019m assuming in this experiment that you are a good tipper when you go to a restaurant. Meaning, you don\u2019t always give 10% or 15%, I hope it\u2019s not 10%. But if the person who\u2019s waiting on you does a great job, you give them more of a tip. Now, imagine you\u2019re marketing in human form as a waiter. Imagine that it\u2019s the, you know, it\u2019s spam-filled interruption-oriented, filled with promises you don\u2019t keep, hyping your way through things hoping a few people are silly enough to latch into it, selfish, aggressive, bullying. If you had a waiter like that, would you give them a tip at all? Probably not.", "But, when we have a waiter who is kind, clear, putting in an effort, aware of what we need, showing up when we need them, guiding us to the next thing that delights us, that person gets a 25% tip and for a good reason, right? And so, for me, I am really moved when I encounter someone on the telephone, someone in person, someone who is doing their job who clearly cares. And I would go out of my way to do business with that person. And so when I do my work and I try to talk about how people can do their work, that\u2019s the goal, right? The goal is, \u201cYou are a human. Your customer is a human. Let\u2019s treat each other that way.\u201d", "Nathan: Yeah. I love that. You know, that\u2019s brilliant. Great analogy. Few more questions. We have to work towards wrapping up because I know you gotta run soon. One, what have you had to sacrifice to get where you are today? What have you had to give up?", "Seth: I think the biggest thing I\u2019ve had to give up is the quiet certainty that I have made my boss happy. You know, the apparent safety of saying everything in my inbox is done, I can just relax this afternoon. And that means that I will find myself at 3:00 in the morning writing something down and I post it that I can\u2019t read the next morning because something popped into my head that I wanted to share. And it means that I never get what some people think of as the privilege of saying, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d", "And a lot of people have trouble imagining a life where you\u2019re never done. But every time I get close to the point of saying, \u201cYou know what? I should just stop.\u201d I realize I would hate being able to say I\u2019m done. So, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve sacrificed very much. I\u2019ve worked super hard not to sacrifice anything in terms of my family and I don\u2019t think working a lot of hours is correlated in any way with success, so I don\u2019t. And I do think that working with more passion than most people is correlated with success. And so when I\u2019m done with work, I\u2019m pretty empty.", "Nathan: And, out of all your success, you know, \u201csuccess in the eye of society,\u201d I know you probably see that way, what do you value the most out of all your achievements, accomplishments?", "Seth: Three years ago, I was in Kibera, which is the biggest slum in Kenya, and a bunch of young men and a few young women had started a book club. And the Kibera book club had read my friend Jacqueline\u2019s book first and then they read \u201cLinchpin,\u201d and I went to run their meeting. And, watching people who by every measure of the privileged world, did not have any of the things that we think are essential, eagerly just with such detail talking about my book that these 40 people had read my book more closely than anyone I had ever talked to including friends and family. It was stunning to me that I could travel 10,000 miles across the earth, safely and in comfort, go to a place that, by many measures, isn\u2019t a place that most people would choose to live and be invited into the home of these group of people and see that not only did it impact them, but that they were already eagerly impacting everyone around them. It gave me real hope for who we are as a people and it invigorated me to step back into the kind of work that I\u2019m privileged to be able to do.", "Nathan: That\u2019s amazing story. You know, I\u2019m with you. I think that\u2019s where the real gold is that having that impact. And I\u2019ve seen those emails come through where somebody says, you know, you\u2019ve changed their life. You know, you can\u2019t put a price on that, hey.", "Seth: That\u2019s right, you can\u2019t. And the thing that\u2019s extraordinary is, you know, not only did my English teacher write in my yearend book that I was the bean of her existence and that I would never ever amount to anything. But the door is still open, right? Like, no one is gonna be the next Seth Godin. No one wants you to be the next Seth Godin. Bbut there\u2019s plenty of room for the next you because we need you, a different person, to stand up and say, \u201cHere, I made this.\u201d Those doors aren\u2019t gonna be open forever but they are open right now and I just don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t walk through them.", "Nathan: Yeah,\u00a0 I\u2019m loving this conversation, Seth. I could speak the whole day. Last question though because I know you gotta hit the road. Action items for our audience, aspiring, and novice entrepreneurs. Three action items.", "Seth: Well, I guess action item number one, the most important one is, stop being an aspiring entrepreneur and be an entrepreneur, and that means ship some work and get paid for it. Action item number two is figure out who you can teach. You know, most people who ask someone to mentor them would be better off mentoring someone else instead because that act of teaching someone who doesn\u2019t know something you know will make you significantly smarter. And then, I guess, the third simple building block action item is, blog every day. It doesn\u2019t matter if anybody reads it, it doesn\u2019t matter. If you put your real name on it, blog every day because the act writing something down that you believe in, that you\u2019ve thought about, and knowing you have to do it again tomorrow will make you better at everything you do.", "Subscribe To the Podcast on ", "iTunes", ", ", "Soundcloud", ", ", "Stitcher", " and ", "Spotify", " ", "Podcast", "About ", "Nathan Chan", "Nathan Chan is the founder and CEO of Foundr, a global media and education company for entrepreneurs.

It\u2019s an absolute pleasure. I\u2019m really excited about today\u2019s guest, this is a really interesting one. It\u2019s with a founder called Rob Rebholz, and he is the founder of a company called SpaceWays and they are disrupting the storage industry, the self-storage industry. And it\u2019s a very, very powerful model they have where it allows you\u2026 They\u2019ve introduced technology with self-storage where it\u2019s all on demand, all on request. And you can go online and you can get someone to come, pick up your stuff, and then you can get it delivered to you, and these guys are rapidly growing. And they\u2019re founded out of Germany, and they\u2019re backed by a company called Rocket Internet.", "So, yeah, these guys are killing it. They\u2019ve only been around for over a year or under, so it\u2019s really interesting to hear how well they\u2019re doing, how they\u2019ve acquired customers early on. And Rob shares with me some brilliant marketing tactics, like he loves his marketing. And, yeah, this is a really, really fun interview. I got a lot of gold from Rob. He was really fun to talk to so I think I\u2019m gonna\u2026I think you\u2019re really going to love this one. A ton of good marketing stuff. If you\u2019re looking for good marketing tactics, strategies, tips, tricks,this is a great one. So let\u2019s jump in to this show but before I do, I just wanted to let you know what\u2019s happening in my world if it\u2019s of interest. Just booked some flights to the States, which is pretty exciting. I think I may be doing a meet-up or something. It may be in NY or LA.

So, I wish you all a fantastic day, evening, night, morning, wherever you are in the world. Now let\u2019s jump into the show.", "So, Rob, can you just tell me how you got your job?", "Rob: My current job at SpaceWays?", "Nathan: Yeah.", "Rob: I wouldn\u2019t call it a job, I would say how I\u2026kind of, how we came up with this opportunity and ended up launching SpaceWays. But what basically I\u2026me and two of my friends from university, we\u2019d been thinking about business ideas and launching a company for quite some time, and then, you know, at some point in time we were all, kind of, free to do something new. I had just sold my previous company and the two other guys, you know, had decided to quit their jobs, so we looked at business models, opportunities and fell in love with this idea, and decided to launch SpaceWays.", "Nathan: I see. And can you tell us a little bit about Spaceways and how the idea came about?", "Rob: Yeah. So, SpaceWays is an on-demand storage service, which means that people go to a website, they tell us how many boxes they need to store whatever items they don\u2019t have room for, we deliver those boxes to their doorstep, free of charge, they pack the boxes, they collect any oversized items that they wanna store, we pick everything up, again, free of charge, people then pay a monthly storage fee. And whenever they want their stuff back, they just go online, let us know and we return their items within 24 hours. And people use us for all kinds of reasons. Well, there is people who are moving, there is people who are, you know, who are going abroad, renting out their apartments, or, you know, people using us for seasonal storage. So lots of use cases.", "And we realized that this is an awesome business model when we looked at different markets and realized that the self-storage market is incredibly big, it\u2019s still growing, it hasn\u2019t changed, it hasn\u2019t been disrupted in decades. Right? Self-storage is still done the way it\u2019s been done 20 years ago, and so we just felt like there was a huge opportunity in that space, not only in the current markets, but also in terms of providing a new kind of service to people who would never have considered self-storage. And I would say that that\u2019s one of our key marketing challenges, kind of, building a market.", "Nathan: Yeah. Look I\u2026 When I first heard about you, I was very, very impressed with the idea. And, you know, I don\u2019t know where I heard this, years and years ago before I even started my first business, you know, maybe \u201cForbes\u201d or \u201cEntrepreneur\u201d recommended one of the top five business models or franchises to buy into was a self-storage business.", "Rob: Yeah, it is an awesome business. I mean, if you look at the established players there, they have incredible gross margins and, you know, they are growing year on year but they\u2019re not doing much to, kind of, improve their service offerings so it just makes sense, right?", "Nathan: I see. So, when did you start this company?", "Rob: We had started SpaceWays a bit more than a year ago. And yeah, it\u2019s been quite a journey. We initially saw our headquarter, let\u2019s say our overhead functions because we don\u2019t see ourselves as a German company but our overhead functions are in Berlin. We then initially launched London, expanded to Paris, Chicago, Toronto, and now finally Sydney.", "Nathan: I see. And I\u2019m curious, like how much traction? Are you able to share with us? Fast forward, we touched on, you know, you started the company a year ago, it was quite young, can we fast forward to now where you guys are at? Like you\u2019re obviously growing quite rapidly and expanding. Can you tell us just where you\u2019re at now?", "Rob: Yeah. So, London was our test market, it just made a lot of sense, right, because it\u2019s close to Berlin. A lot of, you know, very high density, extremely high rents, etc. So London was our test market and we felt confident that we could, kind of, replicate the success around the world so we\u2019ve started adding cities. And yeah, it\u2019s been great. People really liked the business model and what we\u2019re doing and that\u2019s why we ended up in Sydney.", "Nathan: I see. And how many\u2026are you able to say how many customers, traction around\u2026any numbers?", "Rob: So we don\u2019t share financials but, again, the reason why we\u2019re expanding so fast is because it\u2019s working. Right?", "Nathan: Yeah. Okay. And I understand you guys you\u2019ve received funding from Rocket?", "Rob: Yes.", "Nathan: How did that come about? And can you tell us a little bit, for our listeners, about Rocket Internet.", "Rob: So, Rocket Internet is a big European incubator and, you know, when the three of us decided to launch a company, we had various ideas, we talked to lots of people, you know, lots of investors, business angels, incubators and we were just\u2026we really liked Rockets because they had the\u2026 They\u2019re very driven, they\u2019re extremely, you know, extremely experienced in building great companies and scaling them. So, yeah, we decided to build this company with Rocket.", "Nathan: So you did an incubator with them?", "Rob: Exactly.", "Nathan: I see. So this incubator would have been a year ago?", "Rob: Yeah, I mean, so we initially started out in the Rocket offices. You know, basically the three of us and a couple of Rocket guys that supported us and then, you know, step by step we became more independent, built our own team, moved out after around three months. And Rocket kept, you know, funding what we were doing because, I guess, they, kind of, they like the traction that we had.", "Nathan: I think it\u2019s a brilliant idea, it\u2019s so smart and\u2026", "Rob: Thank you.", "Nathan: I\u2019m curious. Are there are any other players in this space, right now, doing what you guys are doing with disrupting this industry?", "Rob: There is companies\u2026there is companies like us around the world. So we\u2019re definitely not the only ones. Basically in every major city there\u2019s a company, kind of, trying something like that. The business model has first been tried in Chicago actually seven years ago, the guys who actually, you know, tried to build a company in the on-demand storage space, it didn\u2019t succeed back then, but I think the time is right. I think people are a lot more\u2026have become a lot more tech savvy and I think the opportunities to now really make this work and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, right? We\u2019re seeing that this works and this makes a lot of sense right now.", "Nathan: Yeah, okay, I see. And, you know, how did you identify, when you\u2019re in that incubator and you and your other two co-founders, how did you guys identify that this is a space you want to play in? Did you come to the incubator with the idea in mind that you were going to create SpaceWays, or did you\u2026you just?", "Rob: So when we decided to join Rocket, and we already had a couple of ideas, but then we sat down with Rocket and spent around two months actually, looking at other markets as well as business models that we thought were interesting, and ended up with this one, just because we just got really excited by this opportunity.", "Nathan: Yes, I see. And I\u2019m curious, you say that you sold your last company. What made you wanna do an incubator? Because generally incubators are for first time entrepreneurs, you know, first\u2026early stage, you know. I\u2019m curious around that.", "Rob: You know, with my first company we\u2026 I really had\u2026there is lots of challenges. Right? You\u2019re always, one example, one challenge that you\u2019re always facing is that you\u2019re constantly fundraising. You initially bootstrap the business and then you\u2019re getting, looking for angel financing, then you\u2019re looking for VC financing, you\u2019re always fundraising and it takes a lot of your time. With Rocket, we didn\u2019t have that problem. You have a strong supporter that funds you as long as you show traction and, kind of, the whole topic of fundraising is a kind of, off the table. And you have access to amazing people, great resources which I thought was a great opportunity, and it\u2019s proven to be very helpful in building this company. So I would say it depends, right? There are certain incubators and accelerators that are for first time entrepreneurs, and there is others where you can\u2026that you can benefit from even if you are a bit more seasoned.", "Nathan: I see. And can you tell us, because I know you handle all of the marketing and PR, like how are you driving traffic to the site? How are you getting buzz around SpaceWays? How are you growing it? Can you give us some really good tactics that are working for you guys now that others, listening to this, might be able to learn and apply to their business?", "Rob: I can\u2026 I should probably start talking about all of the mistakes we\u2019ve made.", "Nathan: Okay, let\u2019s start with the mistakes.", "Rob: Plenty of those obviously. So, you know, we started out and we thought about targeting in a more traditional sense where, you know, we define target groups. The thing about, you know, in our case was students, as with young professionals, young families, etc. And you, kind of, create profiles for those people and you think about how to target them. That\u2019s what we did, and then we realized that the people that end up using our service are not necessarily people who followed a certain demographic segment, but it\u2019s rather people that go through life events. So it\u2019s people who are moving, people who are, you know, starting relationships, people who are\u2026sorry, who are moving in with their boyfriend or girlfriend and don\u2019t wanna get rid of all of their stuff, it\u2019s people breaking up, it\u2019s people who like using it for seasonal storage. It\u2019s rather the use cases that we have to target and that has changed our mindset, kind of, that realization and now we\u2019re actually\u2026you know, we\u2019re not thinking about traditional customer groups, but we\u2019re thinking about use cases, how to target people who would need us when they go through certain life events.", "Nathan: I see. And how do you find those people right now?", "Rob: It\u2019s a mix of activities. I think there\u2019s always going to be mass marketing channels where you just try to build the brand and it\u2019s, kind of, spread the word through everything, you know, from online marketing, you know, banner advertising, to flyering. But, then, I think the big opportunity is actually being very targeted in the activities. So if you go on Facebook, you can target certain life events, right? So if somebody is, you know, changed their relationship status or has just moved and, kind of, indicated that on Facebook, you can target those people and tell them, \u201cHey, there\u2019s\u2026there\u2019s an awesome service out there that might be beneficial.\u201d If you\u2019re talking about offline activities, and offline is quite an interesting channel for us because there is not that much search traffic for the stuff that we\u2019re doing, you\u2019ve got to think about partnerships. And I think that\u2019s the big learning for us and that would be my recommendation to any, you know, entrepreneur, kind of, launching a company, think about who is already targeting the people that you want to use your service. So, in our case, that would, for instance, be real estate agents because the idea was people who are moving, and then you got to figure out how to incentivize those guys to promote your service.", "Nathan: I see. So you\u2019ve had some big\u2026it sounds like you have big wins with partnerships with real estate companies.", "Rob: Yes.", "Nathan: I see. And how did you guys come to that conclusion around that you were targeting, you know, coming out with a custom avatar or a certain kind of person as opposed to the events? How did you guys work that out?", "Rob: I think you just have to be extremely data driven. Right? You\u2019ve got to\u2026 At least that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, you have to constantly, kind of, look at your customers and the people who are using the service and you\u2019ve got to figure out how they found out about you, who they are, and whether there is, kind of, there is opportunity to get more people like that. You know, I think you always have to be talking to your customers to figure out, kind of, you know, what excites them about your service, and very often you realize that people are using you for reasons that you would have never expected. My favorite example is this girl or this guy who called us in London, you know, he asked us, you know, why we had delivered boxes to his doorstep. It turns out he\u2019d broken up with his girlfriend, or his girlfriend had broken up with him and she had ordered boxes for him to move out. He ended up using us. But, you know, those are the use cases that you wouldn\u2019t expect, right? You wouldn\u2019t\u2026you would never expect that people breaking up would be using your service, but if that\u2019s the case, great, kind of, take it from there.", "Nathan: And how exactly are you facilitating this customer feedback? Do you have it on automation? Like let\u2019s say somebody purchases your service, do they get an order responder email that comes through? Like how are you facilitating that, out of curiosity?", "Rob: So I think it\u2019s always\u2026it has to be a combination of automation, having like certain systems in place that, kind of, track customer satisfaction and that ensure that you\u2026that you provide amazing service and that if anything goes wrong, you figure it out early on. But, at the same time, I think there\u2019s nothing more valuable than picking up the phone and calling a few customers. I still get on the phone from time to time and call a couple of our customers just to figure out why they like us, what they wanna change about our service, etc., because those are the people that, you know, those are the people that paid money to use your service, and I think you\u2019re gonna do everything you can to, kind of, make sure you turn those into ambassadors and find more like them.", "Nathan: Yeah, this is really great and we\u2019re getting quite technical. I\u2019m curious, what exactly\u2026 Are there any specific must questions that you ask them when you speak to them on the phone?", "Rob: I think the first question you have to ask is, you know, \u201cHow did you find out about us?\u201d Because ultimately you wanna figure out which of your marketing channels are working, and then you kind of take it from there. You ask them, you know, why they\u2026what they are using your for, which is very interesting very often because, again, people might use us for entirely different reasons than you would have expected. Then you just try to talk to them and figure out what they would improve, what they like about your service, etc.", "Nathan: Okay, look, this is great, this is really useful stuff. Let\u2019s switch gears and talk about, you know, your journey as an entrepreneur. Can you tell us a little bit about your first business? What number of business is this for you? How long have you been an entrepreneur?", "Rob: Yeah, so in a former life, I was a management consultant.", "Nathan: I see, yes.", "Rob: So I took a pretty risk-averse path. And, you know, I always wanted to launch a company and then, you know, after a couple of years in management consulting, I just felt like the time was right. You know, two of my colleagues and me, we just had this idea for a company and, you know, we just decided to quit our jobs and launch this company and it\u2019s been great. I didn\u2019t regret that decision because it\u2019s, you know, I think there\u2019s a lot to being an entrepreneur, it\u2019s a lot more challenging than any role in the corporate world just because it can be very extremely stressful. You know, I think it\u2019s very rare that you just come up with an idea and you launch a company and then everything, you know, goes smoothly. I think you have to\u2026you know, there\u2019s very painful phases that you go through and it\u2019s part of the journey and that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting at the same time.", "Nathan: So, when was your\u2026 When did you launch your first company? And can you tell us a little bit about that, and how it was sold, and how that came about?", "Rob: Yeah. So my first company was a web-only brand for kids fashion, so we were cutting out the middlemen. And, you know, as kids grow very, very quickly, we had this add on service where people could send back outgrown clothing and get a discount on their next purchase. And yeah, we\u2026 So we built that company and ultimately sold it to a bigger player that, you know, is integrating it into their portfolio.", "Nathan: And when did you start that company, and how long did you work on that?", "Rob: So, we started that company in 2011, and worked on it for the last three years.", "Nathan: I see. And then you sold it and then moved, now you started SpaceWays?", "Rob: Exactly, exactly.", "Nathan: And before that you were a management consultant?", "Rob: Exactly.", "Nathan: And, you know, you talk about the journey of an entrepreneur, it\u2019s very challenging. Can you tell us about some of the sacrifices you\u2019ve had to make to get where you are today?", "Rob: Sleep. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it sacrifices. I mean, obviously, you\u2019re not making as many as you would be making if you\u2019re a, you know, a consultant or something like that. But I think, you know, nobody should go into entrepreneurship to get rich, I think you get into that field because you wanna, kind of, build something and that have an impact or\u2026you know, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s, kind of, sacrifice, making less money because that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. Yeah, it\u2019s stressful. We probably work a lot more than any other job. You work weekends, you work nights, just to see your baby. You, kind of, you wanna be successful, you want to figure out how to make things work so, you know, that\u2019s definitely one of the other sacrifices that once again I wouldn\u2019t consider a sacrifice, it\u2019s just like it\u2019s part of what you do as an entrepreneur. Never knowing, kind of, where you will be in three months or, you know, what\u2019s gonna happen in three months, that\u2019s obviously another challenge.", "Nathan: Can you tell us about your size of your team and how you\u2019re handling this rapid growth? Because I know it\u2019s a quality problem to have but it can be hard.", "Rob: Yeah, you know what, I think that\u2019s a great question. So our team has grown to 40 people around the world, and we still take hiring extremely seriously. I think the team is the most important, the most important element to a successful company and what\u2026 You know, being in all those countries, we still try to ensure that we hire people who have, you know, who have entrepreneurial mindsets, who are driven, who are diverse but at the same time, get along with each other. And we try to maintain a culture of collaboration and support. I think that that\u2019s extremely important because we don\u2019t want, you know, the people running the countries be competing against each other. We are actually super happy that the people who are in our countries or managing the countries, the cities are actually, they check very regularly, they exchange ideas, they just push each other to, you know, to, kind of, be the best they can and in each city and that\u2019s\u2026I think that\u2019s helped us a lot. And that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019ve been able to expand to all those cities because there\u2019s lots of knowledge transfer and support. I think if there was, you know, an air or culture where you\u2019re, kind of, competing against each other, that wouldn\u2019t be possible.", "Nathan: Yeah, I see. And you talk about teams and you think it\u2019s one of the most critical things to building a successful company. You know, how do you structure teams? What do you look for when you\u2019re hiring? You said you take that very seriously.", "Rob: So, I mean, we have not hired a single person that we didn\u2019t feel that they were 100% perfect for that job. You know, if you need somebody for a certain role and you don\u2019t find that person for a month, two months, I think you shouldn\u2019t, you know, go for somebody that you feel isn\u2019t the person who is gonna do a great job in that role. You should spend another one month, two months, to find that person. And if that requires you to do 100 interviews, you\u2019ve got to do 100 interviews. And I think, at the same time, when you interview people, it shouldn\u2019t just be you but it should also be, you know, the people who are gonna work with them. Right? So we always have our staff to interviews as well to make sure that we hire the right people. I think that\u2019s, kind of, the approach that you should be taking.", "Nathan: And do you guys like to hire on skill or character?", "Rob: I think it\u2019s a combination, but I would say character is more important. I think what I\u2019ve seen especially in startups is that if you go with 20 people who have like 10 years of experience, that isn\u2019t always helpful because those are the guys who know how things have been done for the last 10 years, as opposed to being the ones who wanna figure out new ways to be successful and, you know, think outside the box.", "Nathan: I see. Look, we have to work towards wrapping up. So I have a few questions around, you know, your learnings, if there\u2019s anything you wish you knew now that\u2026", "Rob: Plenty of stuff.", "Nathan: Please share away.", "Rob: We probably don\u2019t have enough time.", "Nathan: All right, let\u2019s go for top three then. Top three.", "Rob: Top three. First thing is, and we\u2019ve mentioned this, figuring out how to target, how to do targeting. And it is not always about going for, you know, demographics. Second thing is, you know, having a vision very early on. So, we, you know, we always, kind of, knew where we wanted to go, but I think it took us a bit too long to, you know, put our vision on paper and think about what it means to, kind of, strive to achieve that vision and communicate that to the team to, kind of, align everybody, so that\u2019s the second thing. Third thing is\u2026topic is I would say is the importance of being data driven in everything that you do. So I\u2019m not saying we weren\u2019t data driven when we launched this company, but we\u2019ve become a lot more data driven over the last year. I mean, we check everything, we check\u2026 Like when we don\u2019t do firing, we check the performance of, you know, locations, certain creatives, etc., and that has helped us immensely. So I would say being data driven at everything you do. I would say those are the three, the top three. I can probably think of another like 10 or 20, but let\u2019s do that another time.", "Nathan: Oh, good. No, those are some great ones. When you talk about data and tracking and testing, are there any notable web apps, or SaaS, or tools, that that you guys would recommend?", "Rob: I would say you start out with, you know, the spreadsheets.", "Nathan: Spreadsheets.", "Rob: Yeah, you kind of, think about the relevant KPIs that you wanna track or that you should be tracking and then you create the spreadsheet. I\u2019m not sure whether it makes sense as, you know, an early stage entrepreneur to use sophisticated tools. Obviously, you know, step by step you, kind of, you start using tools for tracking, let\u2019s say, customer inquiries, etc., etc. But, initially, everything is pretty much spreadsheet based.", "Nathan: And out of curiosity, what are some powerful tools that you guys are using right now to help with the growth of your business?", "Rob: Asana is amazing. It\u2019s this amazing portal management tool, and we go crazy on Asana. I mean, we\u2019ve taken it as far as having created our own best practice guide for Asana. That\u2019s how important Asana is for us just because it\u2019s an amazing tool if you use it right. I think if you ensure that everybody understands how it works and people use it in a consistent way, it\u2019s a big lifesaver especially if you\u2019ve got teams across the world and you need to coordinate them and you wanna ensure that people don\u2019t get, you know, like, 200 e-mails a day and then lose track of the things that they have to do, priorities, etc.", "Nathan: That\u2019s actually\u2026that\u2019s a really good one that I must ask you. You know, you\u2019re managing a global team, you\u2019re running a lot of your, obviously, all of your tasks through Asana. You know, what are some good best practices? Like just a couple of good tips for managing that team on Asana.", "Rob: The first thing is, kind of, creating a proper structure. The first, creating a structure that\u2019s consistent, right? You don\u2019t want the team in Chicago be using one kind of structure and then the team in Sydney are coming up with an entirely different structure because that just creates confusion. So you want consistency in terms of the structure of the project you\u2019re setting up, then you wanna ensure that everybody obviously uses it excellently to track certain tasks in a systematic manner, all right? You don\u2019t want one person putting in all kinds of details in the Asana task and the next person just having, you know, kind of, too high level bullet points. You just have to ensure that whoever is\u2026looking at certain tasks and looking at certain projects, gets what\u2019s going on and isn\u2019t confused. And you\u2019ve got to constantly remind people to use Asana. So people just have so much stuff going on where everybody is overloaded, you just gotta make sure that everybody understands the importance of a tool like that, and uses it.", "Nathan: And when we talk about tools, you know, what are some tools you use as an entrepreneur to help scale you up? Are there are any cool tools you use that you live by, on your phone, or any apps, web apps, anything?", "Rob: I\u2019m on Quora all the time.", "Nathan: Quora. You like Quora?", "Rob: I love it. I think that\u2019s the best source of knowledge there is on the web next to your podcast, of course.", "Nathan: Thank you.", "Rob: Well, I think it\u2019s, you know, you obviously, you know, try to\u2026you, kind of, you read, you know, TechCrunch, etc., etc., but if you want, you know, insights and you want to drive people to certain topics, and hear from the experts, and, kind of, go a step beyond the usual stuff that\u2019s written in articles that have been published, I would say Quora is an amazing source of knowledge. And I just love it. Like whenever I have spare time, I open Quora on my mobile and, kind of, read the articles.", "Nathan: That\u2019s a great one, that\u2019s a great one. Okay, well, look, we have to work towards wrapping up, Rob. This is been a fantastic interviewe. I\u2019ve had a lot of fun speaking with you, and we\u2019ve covered lot of ground and we\u2019ve got some really good stuff that people can take away. So, was there any things that you\u2019d like to touch off with or finish off with? Any questions that you wanted me to ask you that I haven\u2019t asked you? Any final words?", "Rob: I think that\u2019s one big question that you haven\u2019t asked, and that\u2019s where can people use our service?", "Nathan: Yeah, yeah, please. Plug away, plug away.", "Rob: spaceways.com.au. By the way, that\u2019s another learning, right? In everything we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re always trying\u2026we\u2019re always selling, right? When we printed business cards, we didn\u2019t just print regular business cards, but we printed codes on the back because I thought we can use them to, you know,\u00a0 to our service.

Looking back on his journey, he says, \u201cThe only big regret I have \u2026 is, I would\u2019ve started an email newsletter a lot earlier if I had realized how valuable it would become to me.\u201d", "\u201cI think the way to use a newsletter is, for instance, to make it really important content that\u2019s very unique and the opposite of very shareable,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very private.\u201d An email newsletter presents an opportunity to forge relationships beyond snippets of social media sharing.", "And relationships embody Brogan\u2019s approach. He believes that community is the key to success. \u201cIf you are fortunate enough to have a community to serve, then you will always do better than the person that just has ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a big follower of the concept that a rising tide raises all boats. Every dollar I\u2019ve made \u2026 has community attached to it.\u201d", "Community isn\u2019t just about the relationships you have with readers and customers. It\u2019s also about how you relate to everyone else in your industry and beyond. Brogan believes that if you help other people and connect them with others who can help them, you will get ahead. It\u2019s a perspective that parallels the views of Wharton Professor Adam Grant. In his bestselling book Give and Take, Grant argues that givers \u2014 those who contribute to others without demanding a return \u2014 are successful in business.", "Compared to total self-interest or desperate people-pleasing, Brogan\u2019s advice to create community and build relationships seems to be a superior strategy. \u201cStop spending all your time sucking up,\u201d he says. \u201cBut instead spend your time raising up all the people around you.\u201d", "\u201cIf I\u2019m the person who puts one hand into another person\u2019s hand, and I never ask for a penny in that interaction, I\u2019m going to get invited to a lot of places,\u201d he explains. Helping other people build relationships benefits everyone involved, and you can act on that now. If you offer help to a community today, you can get help from that community tomorrow.", "\u201cI think that the best community-builders in the world are the ones that spend most of their time pushing the spotlight towards others,\u201d Brogan says. An easy place to apply this perspective is social media. You shouldn\u2019t treat your Twitter feed and Facebook page like meandering monologues. For instance, Brogan often promotes other people\u2019s content.", "This isn\u2019t just true on social media; it should be the central insight to all of your marketing. \u201cI spend a lot more time on Twitter search than I do on Twitter just reading people\u2019s things, because I\u2019m searching for people who are looking for the solution that I offer, so that I can help them even more,\u201d Brogan says. It\u2019s so simple to acknowledge, yet so easy to ignore. Any businesses transaction needs at least two parties. Entrepreneurs must understand the needs, wants, and attitudes of potential customers.", "If you\u2019re deaf to what others want, you\u2019ll screw up. Brogan often watches it unfold in his own inbox. \u201cI get mail all the time from people saying, \u2018Hey, we love your blog! Would you like to try out a baby stroller?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, my kids are eight and eleven, so I\u2019m pretty sure a stroller might not be a good tool.\u2019\u201d", "Know the pitfalls and you\u2019re halfway there. Now here\u2019s the advice you can act on: Listen to others. Find a need. Figure out how you can help them. \u201cEveryone hates to be sold to, but we love to buy,\u201d Brogan says. \u201cThere\u2019s somebody out there so anxious to use your product, but you have to find them and you have to find them gently.\u201d", "Find them gently. That\u2019s what Brogan does, and it works, even if it takes time. Juggling many roles and projects can be hard, and like every entrepreneur, Brogan is busy. He runs a company and publishes a magazine and flies to conferences and cares for his kids and has a fulfilling relationship with his girlfriend and goes to the gym twice a day.", "There are 24 hours in a day \u2014 even the kindest community or shrewdest content marketing won\u2019t change that. So how does Brogan fit everything in? \u201cThe way you do it,\u201d he says, \u201cis you cut out all the baloney in life. I mean, there\u2019s just so much silliness. For instance, I try to make any interview opportunities 20 minutes or less. If I have to have a meeting, if I\u2019m forced to have a meeting, I do it as brief as possible. I don\u2019t watch too much television.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things you can cut out of your life before you tell me you don\u2019t have enough time,\u201d he says.", "Now it\u2019s over to you. You have Brogan\u2019s insights. You know what to do and how to do it. So go make some time and build a community. Start a blog. Publish some content. Raise people up. Listen to them.

The answer is yours to build.", "\u00a0", "Nathan: Hello and welcome to the Foundr Podcast, my name is Nathan Chan and I am your host. Today we have a really, really cool guest, his name is Chris Brogan. I\u2019m super excited to share this interview with you. We had an awesome conversation around content marketing, community building, customer relationship, how to build a presence online. And he\u2019s been doing online businesses and all this stuff ever since pretty much this stuff became the hip thing. So there\u2019s a lot to be learned from him, he shares a lot of really, really interesting stuff around what it takes to grow and build your community and actually what it means to really care about your customer.", "You know, it\u2019s not even a marketing strategy, but you know, one of the biggest things that speaks for itself when you want someone to buy something from you or when that person is going to buy something from you, it\u2019s because they trust you and they believe you care on a fundamental level. So, it\u2019s something that\u2019s really important that I\u2019ve learned, you know, in the past couple of years as getting into this entrepreneurship game, and Chris does this very, very well, so I think you\u2019re gonna love this conversation. It\u2019s an awesome interview, we talk about all sorts of really interesting things.", "Yeah, I hope you\u2019re enjoying these episodes. What\u2019s happening for me this weekend, it\u2019s Australia Day weekend so it\u2019s a long weekend, but for me there\u2019s no difference between if there\u2019s a public holiday or not, I\u2019m just always working, having fun. So yeah, that\u2019s it from me guys, if you are enjoying these interviews, please do take the time if you have two seconds, could you leave us a five-star review and also please check out the magazine.

And I just want to start off with, how did you get your job, doing what you\u2019re doing today?", "Chris: I took my job, I guess I didn\u2019t get one. What happened is way back in the way old days, I mean even way pre-internet, I was involved in bulletin board services, where you would dial up a crappy modem and it would make all kinds of weepy beepy sounds and you would wait a long time to deal with the add your message to a thread of messages and hang up. It would be like Twitter but you could only tweet one human at a time. And back then, I learned the magic of being able to connect with people about like interests. You know here you are, you and I are about as geographically as far apart as humans could be and still it will be on one planet and we can connect.", "And so I fell in love with that well into my\u2026I maybe was 12 when I started getting into that. And so skip a lot of years and I started my first blog in 1998 when we were calling it journaling, somewhere before that I was using America Online and CompuServe and Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and all that. And then somewhere in the 2000s, mid-2000s I realized wait, there\u2019s magic in this, there\u2019s business that could be had and so I started writing about how businesses could use these tools and businesses started paying attention. And I went\u2026one day I just decided I would consult, and the minute I put out my hook, the first really big company mentioned that they wanted to work with me and it was\u2026title was Golf.", "And right after that I mean I\u2019ve just been very fortunate to work with many, many very large companies that everyone would know. Most simply helping them understand how do we use all these digital tools to be human at a distance? You know what\u2019s the relationship-minded way that we can make cool stuff happen on the web? So where other people were trying to memorize SEO algorithms and search and all that and when others were trying to say beat up an email list until the people give up their money and you can learn in 10 easy lessons how to get rich by asking people for their money, I went at this whole other marketplace which was just, how do we make people feel like they\u2019re cared for and treated well and how does that translate into revenue for companies. And that\u2019s kind of how I got there, Nathan.", "My blog since 1998, chrisbrogan.com, it used to be other names before but\u2026and all these other assets that I\u2019ve created on and off and started podcasting in \u201905 has just really given me the opportunity to be there first in a lot of cases. And what I tell a lot of people is, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m all that brilliant, I was just first so everyone quotes me and so it\u2019s kind of a domino effect from there.", "Nathan: It\u2019s really interesting because I\u2019ve been playing this space and being interested in entrepreneurship and in more in particular digital. And I just see your name popping up everywhere and you reference like a lot of people use you as an authority to reference things. And yeah I\u2019m just like, \u201cI\u2019ve gotta talk to Chris Brogan, like why is everybody mentioning Chris Brogan?\u201d I see you popping up everywhere and it\u2019s amazing man. So I wanna start with your online presence, so you\u2019re saying you built it from scratch but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s more than that, just being there first. It must be some key elements to doing that. So, first of all, I\u2019d like to ask if somebody was starting out in the game just right now, they wanna build an online presence, how will they go about that? What\u2019s the easiest way to go about that?", "Chris: Well you know I would say Nathan the first thing is, I would always tell people to start with some kind of a blog. And one reason is that the actual technology to build one something like a WordPress or whatever is just so simple nowadays and when I say that, if you\u2019re looking at that kind of technology going, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d It\u2019s easy to also pay someone to do really fast and set it up so that once you get it behind and learn how to just write the posts and what not.", "If you can use Microsoft Word, then you can probably write a blog. And so what I like about that is it\u2019s free mindreading, meaning your potential prospects can read how you think about ideas and projects and they\u2019ll get a better sense of what you\u2019re going to do. And there\u2019s really almost no company that shouldn\u2019t have some kind of a blog, it\u2019s just a matter of how does that impact people\u2019s choices or decisions or whatever and what can we make them do? And then when I think about the online space, the only big regret I have right after blog is I would have started an email newsletter a lot earlier if I had realized how valuable it would become to me.", "But I don\u2019t mean a lot of these newsletters that I find other people sending me, look like the junk drawer. It looks like stuff they might have copied and pasted that they found all over the net or leftovers in the fridge. Like things that we served fresh a few days ago then I\u2019m just gonna send to you again because why not? And what I think the way to use a newsletter is, for instance, is to make it really important content that\u2019s very unique and very\u2026the opposite of very sharable is very private and it\u2019s like come and get this very important message. And so that\u2019s been a really core element to my business the last couple of years, it\u2019s like I say I regret that I didn\u2019t start really focusing on that a decade ago or so, I\u2019d be in a much different situation.", "Nathan: Let\u2019s talk about content marketing because it\u2019s such a buzz word at the moment and it\u2019s something that I think you do very well. Do you believe that every entrepreneur in business should be doing content marketing right now to increase\u2026essentially lead to increasing size?", "Chris: Not every, because I could see the argument for a lot of e-commerce type platforms maybe not doing that as much or doing it in a different way. But I can say that most every should. First of what I always say about content marketing is that I call it weaponized storytelling. As humans, the way we wander around the earth is we think \u201cOh, do I need this thing to make my life any better? Am I the kind of person who\u2026\u201d And then you fill that blank in. So it could be am I the kind of person who needs a motorcycle? And if you\u2019re the kind of person selling motorcycles so then you\u2019re gonna write an article about you know why doctors are the best motorcycle riders or whatever. And you\u2019re gonna start getting people thinking about why you\u2019re able to solve their problem for them.", "And so I mean I think a lot of entrepreneurial types miss the boat on this because first of what they immediately think is how can I push my product into somebody\u2019s hands? And really what they\u2019re trying to do is how can I come alongside somebody that might have the use of this product or service and how do I tell them the stories such that they see themselves in it? In food, for instance, we might go down to the grocery store and we might see something that we actually don\u2019t know how to use like I remember when I first saw things like is it yucca plants?", "I remember seeing yucca roots or whatever in my grocery store and wondering who dug up the front lawn and stuck it in the bin. And I had no idea, how anybody ate that because I\u2019m originally from a very rural part of the U.S. in Maine. And it looked kind of\u2026I didn\u2019t know but you sort of use it the way you might use a potato or like a squash or a turnip but I had no experience. So nobody did until\u2026and nobody used to buy it, it used to sit there and wither and then they threw it away until they put up a little picture showing one easy way to cook it and then people bought a bunch of it. So I think that that\u2019s true with content marketing, content marketing is also good for making serving suggestions on why and how you should use someone\u2019s product.", "Nathan: Interesting. And how do you gauge about what is good content? Because a lot of people say content is king but how do you gauge that? Because you find that a lot of people just start blurting out posts all the time with blogging, is it the quality of the post or the amount of?", "Chris: So first off, content isn\u2019t king, I\u2019m the king. Content is a tool of mine but I would say that the really important way to think about it is the world\u2019s just getting busier and busier and so there\u2019s two ways to go after that. You can flood the marketplace with information but if the information is not useful, I\u2019m gonna tune you out. I was just making this comment, I\u2019m amazed how many businesses are using Facebook and they finally get me to push like on their product because I like their product, their service or whatever. And then they ask me stupid things when I finally see the posts scroll by in my screen that says like you know what Games of Thrones character are you? And I think I don\u2019t know, the one that pushes unlike on your page I guess.", "And so I\u2019m flabbergasted that if you have my attention, if you\u2019re gonna squander it with something dumb then it\u2019s just not\u2026we\u2019re just not gonna have a long relationship. And so I am not a proponent of the flood the market method, although I do sometimes send a lot of information out but I only send information that I think is valuable to the person that I\u2019m hoping to attract and that\u2019s the big difference. There\u2019s a great book I could recommend by Jay Baer, his last name B-A-E-R called \u201cYoutility\u201d Y-O-U-tility. I think he\u2019s really got the idea on where content is going next.", "Nathan: And how do you find your content ideas?", "Chris: I am never at a loss for ideas Nathan, I have\u2026first off, my newsletter is unique to a lot of people\u2019s newsletters in that you can hit reply and actually talk to me. It doesn\u2019t come from ", "[email\u00a0protected]", "\u2019twantarelationship.com.au. And so my community that I have the pleasure and the opportunity to serve, is frequently asking me questions that are really useful. I mean I\u2019m looking right at some right now that I\u2019m gonna use for future blog posts and whatnot. But the other place I get ideas is sometimes I wander around and I might use my camera phone and see a thought and shoot it for later. I often also ask the question, \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t anyone?\u201d The one thing I\u2019ll tell all of your community to stop doing is following all your peers and thinking you\u2019re gonna get a good idea from them.", "Here\u2019s the hint, if they had a good idea, they either are not ready to share it or it\u2019s not that different than something you\u2019re already doing because you\u2019re all in the same industry. All great innovation comes from far outside your industry so stop reading all the blogs by the people doing the same dumb thing you\u2019re doing, instead go find the weirdos and you\u2019ll have a much better chance of innovating.", "Nathan: Yeah, that\u2019s actually something I try and do. Because if you look and I mean the magazine\u2019s all about entrepreneurship and if you look and read other entrepreneurship blogs and business books and all those kinds of things, you\u2019re gonna come up with the same ideas but if you look in another space, you can see what other people are doing and something else might come to you that you can apply to that niche or that space or just an idea about something else, you know, and you can put your own spin on it. So that\u2019s a great, great point. I\u2019m curious, you talk about community and it was only yesterday that I caught up with a friend and they really highlighted to me the power of having a community, like a tribe that ", "Seth Godin", " would describe. And then, you know, I was doing a little bit of research before I talked to you and I noticed that you have a massive community. Is that something that you always originally went out to try and build?", "Chris: Absolutely, I believe with all my heart that if you are fortunate enough to have a community to serve, then you will always do better than the person who just has ideas. Someone with ideas lacking the community, I mean let\u2019s go medieval for a moment and imagine that, you know, so the way cities used to form was that a military outpost would be somewhere down by some body of water and the reason it\u2019s by the water is of course for travel and for food and other purposes. Well, then a city would form sort of around that military area because it was the safest place to put a marketplace. That real-life physical market where you\u2019d wander through would be where goods and services were exchanged and that\u2019s where trade would spring up.", "Well, community comes from knowing what\u2019s where in the marketplace and who can you get to and who needs this and who do I know who does that? And the way to build that is you just perpetually serve it. And a lot of entrepreneurs and a lot of founders I know think of their customer base for instance which is not a whole community but it\u2019s a subset. They think of that as a tour and all I think all day long is how can I serve these people? And today alone, I mean I wanted to make sure I preface this by saying that I went through about 40 days of really cold, dry, nothing has gone well for me, I\u2019ve had very bad business for about 40 days. Today alone, we had four deals, all of those deals came from community interaction, all of them.\u00a0 And they\u2019ll be about $50,000 or $60,000 worth of business when it\u2019s all recognized, all of that just because of community.", "And so what I enjoy in this process, what I enjoy in these opportunities is none of these came from some ad, none of these came from a search optimized Google placement or some trick that I know how to do and I don\u2019t know Vine. This is all from humans going, \u201cWow, I think Chris knows something about that.\u201d And the reason that they\u2019re willing to say that is because I\u2019d be the first one to say they know how to do X, Y, Z that I don\u2019t. And so here on the show, I recommended Jay Baer\u2019s book, Jay and I work in a lot of the same spaces but why wouldn\u2019t I recommend him? To me, I\u2019m a big follower of the concept that a rising tide raises all boats and I\u2019ve just\u2026I don\u2019t know, every dollar I\u2019ve made Nathan, has community attached to it. So I don\u2019t know another way to do it, to be honest.", "Nathan: And how do you foster that community, what\u2019s the best way you think to have everyone hang out in an area? Like how do you foster it?", "Chris: I\u2019ll tell you how I do it in person and then I\u2019ll tell you how that also works online. When I\u2019m in person when I go to an event\u2026I was just back from an event in San Diego in the U.S. called Social Media Marketing World run by ", "Mike Stelzner of Social Media Examiner", ". 2,000 plus people came, I mean for all I know it\u2019s 4,000 I didn\u2019t really pay attention to how many people. But, every single time I would be in the situation where a few people would approach me, I would make sure we got in a ring and that we just chat, welcoming in anyone else who was coming by who wanted to talk. And quite often, I knew at least a few of the people well enough to turn to another one and say, \u201cOh, did you know Ian, he\u2019s really good at figuring out which digital tools are great. Or did you know ", "Lewis Howes", ", he\u2019s like the master of webinar selling and all that.\u201d And so in that process, I just kept shifting the attention to these other people who were also very interesting leaders and great experts at what they do. And I think that the best community builders in the world are the ones who spend most of their time pushing the spotlight towards others and making sure that other hands connect.", "A long time ago, I think in the book \u201cTrust Agents\u201d we called that be at the elbow of every deal. Meaning, I found the person who puts one hand into another person\u2019s hand and I never ask for a penny in that interaction, I\u2019m going to get invited to a lot of places. And I think that\u2019s one element of community. The other and for some reason, this quote really evidently stuck from my speech last week because I keep seeing it tweeted back to me a lot, which is stop spending all your time sucking up but instead spend your time raising up all the people around you. And I think that\u2019s the other opportunities when you know the other up and comers in your space, stop pretending they\u2019re not there or stop thinking of the competition but instead raise them up and you will go so much further than everyone else who\u2019s trying to fight like crabs in a bucket.", "Nathan: Really become a connector.", "Chris: Well absolutely. I think that you know in \u201cTrust Agents\u201d we call that agent zero, in my other books I mean there\u2019s never a part that doesn\u2019t talk about connecting. But the thing is Nathan you and I both met connectors who are not like that, we\u2019ve met connectors who always have that ulterior motive or we\u2019ve met connectors who are smarmy about it in some way that makes it just feel dirty. And the real goal is just how do you do it with complete selflessness and how do you make sure that the person just knows that it\u2019s just pure love and hope for everyone\u2019s success that makes it work?", "Nathan: We talk about success, there was\u2026one of my favorite quotes is \u201c80% of success is just showing up\u201d and it\u2019s by Woody Allen. What\u2019s your thoughts on that?", "Chris: Well I mean I think showing up is definitely part of it. I\u2019ll tell you, one of the early keys to my success such as it were was that even before\u2026I totally could not afford to do this but I kept signing up and paying to go to conferences and flying there, sometimes when I couldn\u2019t even really pay my mortgage. And so my house would be in jeopardy for a month but I\u2019d show up at an event. I\u2019d land at the airport and I might go to take say $20 out of the automatic machine and maybe $20 wasn\u2019t there. And then I would think, \u201cWell, I sure hope there\u2019s food at this conference.\u201d And I might eat a little toothpaste in between but because I was there all the time, suddenly some really good names in the industry that was seeking entry into kept saying, \u201cWow, that Chris Brogan is everywhere.\u201d", "And coupled with my online presence of being everywhere, it really started to feel like this guy must know something, he seems to be at all the big events. It\u2019s like being a Hollywood guy, Hugh Jackman starts showing up all over the place and you think, \u201cWow, he was going for it.\u201d But instead what he\u2019s probably really doing is what I was doing which is kind of marketing by presence. And it\u2019s expensive and it\u2019s not the easiest thing to do but I\u2019ll say that I\u2019m sure that it contributed to my potential success because you can put your hand in my hand and you could get a\u2026really read on if I was the same person I said I was online.", "Nathan: You talk about marketing right like you have a massive presence online and I just want to know if would you talk about ground roots marketing, how do you approach your marketing? What is the best advice you would give to someone trying to market their online business?", "Chris: Be helpful. What I find most people doing is they\u2019re really dying to explain their product and more times than not, you know everyone hates to be sold to but we love to buy. And so there\u2019s somebody out there so anxious to use your product but you have to find them and you have to find them gently. And I find that from my experience having a blog with certain kind of readership, I get mail all the time from people saying, \u201cHey, we love your blog. Would you like to try out a baby stroller?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, my kids they\u2019re eight and 11 so I\u2019m pretty sure a stroller might not be a good tool. Although I guess I can make them get in it but they\u2019ll probably fight me for it.\u201d", "So there is a lot of times where the offer or the opportunity just doesn\u2019t line up and what I find bad marketers or bad sellers doing is they\u2019re pushing even harder for those kinds of opportunities. It\u2019s so much easier just to listen and find who\u2019s got a need or who\u2019s got something you can do and how can you be helpful to them? And so for instance, one of the reasons I have such a following that I do on places like Twitter is that I show people all kinds of great resources that they can do things with, that are often not mine. I\u2019ve said for a really long time, promote other people\u2019s stuff 12 times as much you promote your own. And then the other thing that I do a lot is I spend a lot more time on twitter search than I do on twitter just reading people\u2019s things because I\u2019m searching for people who are looking for the solution that I offer so I can help them even more.", "Nathan: Wow, that\u2019s really interesting. You do a lot of things, you\u2019re an author, a bestselling author, a writer, a blogger, publisher, entrepreneur, speaker, how do you manage it all?", "Chris: First off it\u2019s not a great thing that I do a lot of things, it just means that I\u2019m like ADD, like everybody else. But I really try to package it into this one thing that I run Owner Media Group. And I folded the Human Business Works corporation inside that and so I\u2019m not doing as much consulting as I can help it although I\u2019ll tell you when the phone rings and they offer money, I don\u2019t say, \u201cOh no.\u201d and hang up on them. So I still consult but I do all that plus I go to the gym twice a day and I have time for relationship with my beautiful girlfriend and I have kids and she has a daughter and you know the way you do it is you cut out all the baloney in life. I mean there\u2019s just so much silliness, for instance, I try to make any interview opportunities 20 minutes or less, I try\u2026if I have to have a meeting, if I\u2019m forced to have a meeting, I do it as brief as possible. I don\u2019t watch too much television, I don\u2019t actually own a television but we watch it on laptops of whatever and, you know, there\u2019s a lot of things you can cut out of your life before you tell me you don\u2019t have enough time.", "I also don\u2019t read all these blogs that everyone seems to read. If it\u2019s in Mashable or TechCrunch or something like that, you\u2019re gonna tell me if it\u2019s interesting. I don\u2019t need to read all 200 posts, you\u2019ll just tell me, \u201cOh, you should check this out.\u201d And that\u2019s kind of what I like. So I\u2019d sooner spend time in a magazine like yours, like \u201cFoundr\u201d because at least I can get some insights from people who are doing the work. And that\u2019s something a lot of people do too, is they just waste so much time trying to keep up and I\u2019d rather just, you know, focus in instead.", "Nathan: We talk about spending\u2026you know, you said that you don\u2019t watch TV and you\u2019ve given up some\u2026I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve given them up but one of my favorite questions that I ask anyone that I interview is, what did you have to sacrifice to get where you are today? What did you have to give up? Because more often than not, we see the end product, so people that come across Chris Brogan we see, you know, you\u2019ve got all these followers on Twitter, you\u2019ve got a rocking blog, you\u2019ve got all these awesome courses, you\u2019ve got these books, you\u2019re doing all these really cool things but what did you have to do to get where you are? Like you said, you started from the beginning. So can you tell me, can you give me an insight?", "Chris: I can totally do that. So one of the things that I did to start and by the way, it\u2019s so funny, a lot of times people say, \u201cWell now you\u2019ve made it so it\u2019s just all gravy from here.\u201d But I haven\u2019t, there\u2019s always more success and if you\u2019re\u2026I hate using words like true and real but a real entrepreneur is never out of danger, right. Donald Trump went bankrupt or just as close to bankrupt as one can get twice in the billions of dollars range, Sir Richard Branson, he has a lot more money to play with these days but he had certainly taken it on the chin several times in this process. So early on what I gave up was I really spent as much of my money as I possibly could and more than I probably should have. I never, ever gambled with anyone else\u2019s money by the way I should say that. I\u2019ve never raised for any projects that I do and there\u2019s days I really wish I did Nathan, but I love being the owner.", "I know too many people that suddenly become employees of the money and I\u2019m just not into it. Then again if I had a really capital intensive plan and I thought I could own the universe, then maybe I would do it but it\u2019s just not how I build. So I\u2019ve given up a lot of my money over the years, I\u2019ve gone pretty close to broke many, many, many times. I\u2019ve so far lived in my home and not in a dumpster but there\u2019s days when I wonder I give up on\u2026there\u2019s a lot of events that sort of the social media crowd love to go to like South by Southwest for instance in Austin Texas. But to me, it\u2019s just like a big six-day party and that\u2019s not interesting to me. I like business and I love to say hi to all those people and hug them and all that but it\u2019s not worth a few thousand dollars for me and six days of not really doing enough business to justify that at this point.", "So a lot of what I\u2019ve surrendered is usually time-based, sometimes it\u2019s some opportunities. When I decided I wasn\u2019t going to really actively seek a lot of consulting, I gave up a lot of revenue because boy, big companies have big checkbooks. But I also started to feel a little disheartened by some of those big companies because certain people would be passionate but then eventually you sort of fall like a little ball bouncing down a hill to the person who is just at their desk to keep it warm. And that gets a little frustrating, so I need passionate people just like you do, I mean I\u2019m sure Foundr really gathers around with a lot of passionate people and so I\u2019ve also given up along the way, so I\u2019ve given up boring people.", "Nathan: It\u2019s interesting.", "Chris: It\u2019s hard to do Nathan, and I know it\u2019s hard to quit boring people but I have. And the other thing I guess one last very big truth is I\u2019ve given up excuses and I would say that\u2019s probably the most germane thing to the Foundr crowd, is I\u2019ve given up allowing excuses to get in the way of my success.", "Nathan: That\u2019s very deep man. We talk about entrepreneurship, what do you believe it takes to build a successful business?", "Chris: To me, it\u2019s everything about the whole concept of\u2026well, to build a successful business versus entrepreneurship. So, entrepreneurs, I think really just have to be willing to risk a lot more than other people and be willing to work. I\u2019ve heard this clich\u00e9 thing that I\u2019ve been repeating far too much which is that entrepreneurs are the kind of people who work 80 hours so that they\u2019ll never have to work 40. And I think that\u2019s true but to make a successful business in my mind, what has to happen truly in the kinds of businesses I build, I should really qualify this by saying that I\u2019m in no way attempting to make lasting businesses that are gonna change the universe. But just to sort of wrap this up I guess, I think that the goal is to make sure that people feel like they belong and that to me is what makes a business and so that\u2019s where I work on the hardest.", "Nathan: Awesome, all right man. Look, we have to work towards wrapping up, it\u2019s been awesome speaking with you. So you\u2019ve got some really interesting insights so I just wanted to say, was there anything you\u2019d like to finish off with?", "Chris: You know the very last thing I\u2019d like to say is that when we\u2019re in this mode and trying to think like a founder, we\u2019re always sort of hungry for resources to give us inspiration and whatnot. But what we should stop being hungry for blueprints and we should be very much more hungry for advice and making sure that we have I guess food. We should have mental food but not blueprints. That\u2019s my last big thought.", "Nathan: All right well we\u2019ll wrap there man.
