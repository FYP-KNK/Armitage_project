According to ", "APQC research", ", only 53% of firms rate their enterprise search as effective or very effective. What do you think is happening with the rest?", "The 53% in the APQC research relates to federated search, which is the idea of having a search engine query third-party search engines and combine the results.

Lack of Ongoing Investment in Enterprise Search", "Organizations too often consider enterprise search to be a fixed-duration project, rather than an ongoing investment. Users change, needs change, and information changes. Search engines can cope with this to an extent, but the can\u2019t offer the same effectiveness as a human assessing business needs.\r\n  Organizations need training and guidance on where the quick wins are in ongoing investment in optimising enterprise search. Google only succeeds on the global Web because it has thousands of people doing this constantly", "2. Re-inventing the Wheel", "Enterprise search budgets are often consumed in developing complex search interfaces and applications from scratch, instead of focusing on configuring off-the-shelf solutions to fit business needs. An enterprise search product should have pre-assembled, best-practice templates for a range of different\r\n  search requirements (e.g. eCommerce search vs. events search vs. courses search) to allow implementation effort to focus on the business aspects of the solution.", "3. Only Solving Part of the Problem", "Most enterprise search products attempt to rank information with respect to its relevance to a text query, but ignore other significant factors that detract from search effectiveness.", "A holistic enterprise search solution should include:", "Do you think an enterprise taxonomy is important?", "We don\u2019t often come across organizations that have enterprise taxonomies. If done well, they can provide benefit to many aspects of knowledge management, including making better use of technologies such as text analytics. However, it\u2019s a significant investment that can fail to pay off if\r\n    implemented ineffectively. The two main problems are:", "1. The taxonomy is not aligned with how the organization uses information.", "This can be a result of the taxonomy classifications not reflecting the way people attempt to find information. It can also be due to an onerous system for classifying content.", "2. Information systems, such as enterprise search tools, being unable to leverage the taxonomy effectively.", "Instead, we recommend organizations invest in a behavioural taxonomy. This includes assessing:", "It\u2019s this kind of information that informs smart decisions around:", "Following the Pareto principle, if you can ensure that 20% of searches work effectively then 80% of the information needs are addressed. This small amount of effort pays large dividends.", "After I\u2019d read ", "Weinberger\u2019s book", ", I was convinced tagging and faceted search in the enterprise was in our future. So, I was surprised to hear you say at our KMLF meeting that most Funnelback users don\u2019t tag documents. Why is that?", "I\u00a0suspect it\u2019s a cultural issue rather than a technology one. The ability to tag content in enterprise search is powerful because it\u2019s not limited to a single data store; users can tag content whether it\u2019s in an EDRMS, file share, social media channel, intranet, or third-party\r\n  website. Funnelback provided a means to do this, but users didn\u2019t see any immediate value in tagging content, so chose not to.", "In hindsight, we would have benefited from complementing the technology with a cultural program of educating users on the benefits of tagging and sharing, and optionally gamifying the experience to reward and incentivise.", "On the other hand, in the last 10 years, faceted search has evolved from a technology used almost exclusively on eCommerce sites, to an out-of-the-box feature in every Funnelback deployment, including intranets, databases, and enterprise search.

Sometimes it is the answer, but it can be a more complicated and costly exercise than necessary. For example, do users want to use an enterprise search\r\n    tool to search their own email, or would they prefer to use the search on their mail client?", "When an organization proceeds with implementing an enterprise search solution, what sort of management and maintenance resources, if any, should the organization be prepared to commit?", "At a minimum, search analytics should be checked monthly with the following questions in mind:", "We also recommend having an expert conduct an annual or bi-annual health check to assess all aspects of the search system, including crawl scope, ranking quality, search filters, etc., as well as ensuring the system is aligned with changing business needs.", "\r\n            Share Article on:\r\n        ", "If you would like to hear from someone in our team, please provide your contact details.

This is the basis of website navigation structures and it should also be incorporated into your search engine. Give people the option to specify the type of content they're looking for when they search, and give them options to filter\r\n  the search results so they can narrow down on the content that interests them. If appropriate, provide sorting options too. These tools can help make a large results set much easier to manage.", "You can use more than just the user's search term to inform the results your search engine delivers. You can also use information such as the user's geographical location, browser language settings, type of device, or the date and time of their search. Incorporating this kind of information into the\r\n  search can increase the chances of returning the right results.", "For example, if you search for 'open day' on a university website, it might be more appropriate to promote and display an 'International Open Day' event result to prospective international students instead of your 'Domestic Student Open Day' counterpart event.

Some will also give you the ability to upload a set of search terms and their corresponding results to make sure that the right results are always returned. Search\r\n  engines can also be used to inform business wide improvements. For example, a report of terms that people are searching for on your site can be used to measure the impact of marketing campaigns, whilst reports detailing the searches that returned no results can unearth potential business opportunities\r\n  or areas where your content needs to be tweaked.", "Your search engine needs to be good. That is, it needs to be fast and it need to be accurate. This is much harder than it sounds and the search engines on the market all differ in the way they handle data.

Firstly, if we have millions of books to search through, we will need to assign document IDs to the book titles (otherwise we will have the same problem we started with, only with titles). Secondly, this matrix does not account for word repetition, otherwise\r\n  known as term frequency. A better inverted-index might look like this:", "Ah, much better!

The crux of the matter remains unchanged: the inverted\r\n  index is to full-text search what electromagnetic suspension is to bullet trains. It underpins the system while allowing for optimal speed and performance.", "The nice thing about having an inverted index, is that one can now tackle the following problems more easily:", "1) Spelling mistakes can be matched against an index of terms as opposed to an unsorted corpus of millions of texts.", "2) Potentially unnecessary stop-words such as \u201ca\u201d, \u201cthe\u201d, \u201cthis\u201d, \u201cor\u201d can be easily discarded.

In fact, the more a full-text search engine is used, the better its result set will become with time.", "The reasons to use a full-text search engine are not limited to this.", "Spelling suggestions, result highlighting, faceted navigation and in recent years, geolocation searches are just a number of other reasons why database-style searching is not only simplistic, it's obsolete. Full-text search is the de-facto method of finding text within huge data sets. Yet like all\r\n  human endeavors, studying and analyzing one field inevitably opens a pandora's box. New problems are revealed, unthinkable situations surface and unprecedented corner-cases are to be dealt with. A very large amount of these have been studied, tackled and solved through years of research. Many others\r\n  remain unsolved. For instance, as computers become more performant and people's tempers become shorter, many are beginning to ask the computer questions in their natural language expecting the first result to be the answer they seek. Full-text search is being used to find images and bleeding edge research\r\n  is even beginning to map facial recognition algorithms to text (and vice-versa).", "The options seem endless and the bar keeps raising in the field of full-text search.
