The bettors enter this promised land anywhere along the 108-mile border between New York and New Jersey. They come down Route 17 to Mahwah, order disco fries at the State Line Diner, and wager. They cross the George Washington Bridge and bet in the KFC parking lot in Fort Lee.

Whores. Dope. Guys who\u2019ll hit you over the head and rob you.\u201d Today, the trucker might add to his list the gamblers.  ", "Speaking of Christie, he\u2019s no idle observer; he\u2019s the architect, and this is a valedictory moment years in the making. In 2011, the then governor of New Jersey nobly launched the battle to legalize sports betting in his state. Why shouldn\u2019t the government get a piece of the $150 billion wagered illegally on sports each year, as estimated by the American Gaming Association? His efforts paid off when, in May 2018, the Supreme Court overturned a 1992 federal law that had banned the practice in all but a few places. New Jersey was among the first states to take advantage, accepting its first bet within a month of the high court\u2019s ruling. Two, actually, each twenty dollars, placed by its current governor, Phil Murphy, on the New Jersey Devils to win the 2019 Stanley Cup (they didn\u2019t) and on defending champion Germany to win the World Cup (they were eliminated in the first round). Christie earned his rightful spot in the Sports Betting Hall of Fame, which is a thing, apparently. Since then, sixteen more states have passed such bills, including New York. None of them come close to New Jersey, which took in nearly $3 billion in its first year of operations. This past May, it surpassed Nevada to become the state in which the highest amount was bet on sporting events\u2014nearly $320 million in that month alone. Why such success? Is it something in the waters of the Ramapo? Perhaps. But also, the state allows you to bet on your phone. Other states have been reluctant to embrace the practice in an effort to drive gamblers toward the traditional brick-and-mortar houses of sin, like casinos and racetracks. Their mistake: In New Jersey, mobile betting accounts for a whopping 82 percent of the state\u2019s overall handle.  ", "You don\u2019t need to be a resident to bet in New Jersey; you just need to be at least twenty-one. But you must be within its boundaries when your bet is placed. Out-of-staters have tried everything they can to get around these restrictions: deploying virtual private networks (VPNs) that mask users\u2019 IP addresses and therefore their location; trying to place bets from the Staten Island Ferry on its journey across New York Harbor; standing atop the Tri-States Monument in Port Jervis, their phones held high and oriented southward. Nothing has worked, thanks to the efforts of the aptly named GeoComply, which is licensed by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement to ensure all bettors comply with the state\u2019s geographical requirements. The company claims that in many cases it can locate users to within a few meters. Anecdotally, I can confirm. FanDuel, the most popular betting app in the state, pinged me while I was in the dead center of the Lincoln Tunnel, a hundred feet underwater and halfway between New York City and Weehawken.

Here, in this dusky underworld, the house is open all day and all night, and it\u2019s less than twenty minutes from midtown Manhattan.

Ahmed, thirty-seven, from Peekskill, New York, is on his lunch break and looking to make it big on a parlay, the Hail Mary pass of sports bets, in which the gambler picks the winners of several games. The odds are much lower, so the payouts are much higher, which is why local bookies don\u2019t like taking parlays. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to take that risk,\u201d Ahmed says. \u201cThe biggest parlay you could do with a bookie was four teams. The biggest parlay you can do with these guys is fifteen.\u201d Ahmed has a magic touch for them. \u201cI had a nine-team parlay last year for twelve grand. Two weeks after that, I had an eight-team parlay for ten grand.\u201d Lunch hour\u2019s nearly over, so he excuses himself to enter his bets, then he\u2019s gone. ", "Three days later.

Then again, the ban was never all that effective, as evidenced by anyone who\u2019s ever collected the betting pool for their fantasy-football league.

The teams have massive industrial heaters by their benches, right in the area where a sideline reporter might operate.", "\u201cThe Panthers were playing here,\u201d Myers remembered. \u201cI had a long coat and I was leaning in on the heater. You know they have those gas heaters. And one of the players was like, \u2018Hey, your jacket's smoking.\u2019 And it had caught fire. So I had to run and put it out.\u201d", "\u201cI once stuck my boot up there to warm my feet and my pants melted,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThose puppies are so hot.\u201d", "Myers, who also works some games from the booth when Buck has a different assignment, is a Florida native who lives in California. Apart from a brief period in Connecticut working for ESPN, he\u2019s never spent much time in these colder climes.", "\u201cMy first time here, I was covering the sideline, and I got here without the proper cold-weather gear. So I just threw on coats, I bought extra hats, and when they came down to the field I think Joe Buck said I looked like Elmer Fudd. Aikman was laughing hysterically.\u201d", "So he went searching for a new strategy.", "\u201cAnother time, I had one of these electric vests, and it was short circuiting,\u201d Myers admitted wryly, \u201cand shocking me like a shock collar.\u201d", "\"There are times you can't form a sentence and your tongue gets super, super heavy, and your lips get stuck together. You sound like a complete idiot.\"", "It\u2019s also five hours without much chance to eat, and zero chance to visit the restroom, a reality reflected in Andrews\u2019s pregame routine: \u201cPeanut butter sandwich. I probably have about four cups of coffee, which is horrible for my heart before. And I mean, if you want to go there\u2014take a pee, go tinkle. We don't have a chance to use the restroom at all during the game. I am full bladder central. Last week, it went to overtime in the wildcard game and I was like, \u2018Oh my God, I'm going to pee my pants.\u2019 There's no place to go to the bathroom and there's no time. And for me, honestly, I don't want to miss anything. So my husband's always like, \u2018Do you realize what you're doing to your bladder and your kidneys?\u2019 I'm like, \u2018Yeah, well, it happens.\u2019\u201d", "Ahead of the game, Andrews and Myers read the clips from local and national press and watch tape from previous games. Andrews always calls her dad for his two cents. Their emphasis is on identifying the storylines coming into the game. The day before the game, Andrews pointed to a much-anticipated matchup between Seahawks receiver D.K. Metcalf and the Green Bay secondary. She\u2019d looked into the possible coverage, spoken with Metcalf\u2019s position coach, \u201cso when Joe and Troy talk about the matchup, I can say, ", "Well, I was speaking with so-and-so and he told me this about so-and-so...", "\u201d ", "Myers and Andrews are thus another part of the big dance they\u2019re all doing: Buck and Aikman dance together, but they\u2019re also moving in time with Zyontz and Russo in the truck, who in turn are dancing together, but who are also in constant back-and-forth with Andrews and Myers, who have to be able to waltz into the same phase Buck and Aikman are in for a 30-second sideline report. It\u2019s like a party scene from a Victorian period piece, where the dancing pairs move in concert with all the others so nobody steps on anybody else\u2019s toes. And the tempo speeds up every year.", "\u201cThe time is so valuable, because of the pace of the game with hurry-up offenses and no-huddle,\u201d Myers said. \u201cSo there's not a lot of time to get any information in. Joe and Troy have their normal flow of the game. We have Mike Pereira, you have commercials. For example, I'll just go to last week. There was a moment where it was, \u2018Hey, how come Dalvin Cook isn't in the game?\u2019 They're not sure, I'm on the sideline, I'm looking, his face guard had cracked and they're replacing it. They didn't have a backup helmet. So I'll quickly hit the key, and sometimes I could just relay that information. Other times, Richie Zyontz will say, \u2018Yeah, if you got it, go now.\u2019 And Troy throws to me and I'll just\u2014watching the snap of the ball, you never want to talk over it because a big play could unfold. So you quickly just say, \u2018Hey, his face guard cracked, that's why he's not in, they're trying to repair it, they don't have a backup helmet.\u2019 And then boom, okay, they can go on.\u201d", "\u201cOne of the best places to be on the field is right where the quarterback comes out, especially at a three and out,\u201d Andrews added. \u201cEspecially when they've been sacked, especially after an interception. They either say crap to the coach, or they say crap to their line.\" She added that, due to NFL guidelines, she never quotes players and coaches directly during the game. You have to paraphrase.", "You can prepare all you like, but it\u2019s mostly just reacting. Andrews was working the Cleveland Browns game and was a few minutes away from interviewing Baker Mayfield when his teammate, Myles Garrett, smashed a helmet against Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph\u2019s bare head. (That\u2019ll change the conversation quickly.) Andrews and the Fox production team also played a role in resolving the great Cowboys coin-toss debacle this season, when the referees said Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott hadn\u2019t formally asked to receive the ball in the second half, meaning the L.A. Rams would get the ball to start both periods. Some detective work from Andrews and the camera-and-sound folks made it right before halftime.", "And then there\u2019s the unpredictability of standing up against the gridiron when dozens of the world\u2019s fastest, strongest, and largest people are ferociously competing next to you. I asked Andrews if she\u2019s concerned about the threat of getting hit with a projectile\u2014or a human\u2014while standing with her back to the field for a standup.", "\u201cYes,\u201d she said gravely. \u201cPam [Oliver] got nailed in the face a couple of years ago, and that is frightening. I mean that is so dangerous. There was last week before my feature, I think, for the pregame show the receiver's coach was warming up somebody from the Saints and I just looked at my handheld and I was like, ", "I'm not comfortable here. It's just not worth it.", " It's not. Players have helped me quite a bit, because I've almost gotten nailed. But I got hit with a line drive covering baseball for ESPN.

Making all this go, in sync and at the right time, is the responsibility of everybody in the truck. Even standard plays require remarkable precision.", "\u201c[Davante] Adams is the lone guy now for Aaron Rodgers,\u201d said Aikman over the live audio for viewers at home. The truck watched from the standard sideline camera as the Packers quarterback snapped the ball and found tight end Jace Sternberger by the sideline.

Zyontz leaned back as \u201cGreen\u201d went live on the broadcast feed after the flash of a \u201cFOX Sports\u201d graphic segue. The view seemed to be from a camera off the endzone behind the Packers line, which followed Clowney as he tracked Sternberger out to the sideline. It was this kind of thing Russo had discussed with his camera guys in a meeting three hours before the game, in which he laid out the key characters to keep a lens on\u2014Clowney among them, along with star receivers and head coaches. \u201cProduce your own cameras, to a certain extent,\u201d he'd said, with the tone of someone repeating an old adage worn from a long season\u2014and many long years\u2014of doing this.

A camera on the opposite sideline rolling in slo-mo appeared to show Clowney grabbing at Sternberger\u2019s helmet to bring him down, contorting the receiver\u2019s neck. But Aikman was casting some doubt that it constituted a penalty in the on-air commentary. Meanwhile, the folks in the truck were already onto the next one.", "\u201cPurple! Purple. Now purple.\u201d And then we were behind the Seahawks end zone, watching clearly now as Clowney grabbed at the helmet of the receiver to bring him down. Fox\u2019s rules analyst, Mike Pereira, jumped in to discuss whether Clowney\u2019s hands had gone underneath the helmet. But in the truck, they were already on to showcasing the storyline. They moved to another sideline camera which zoomed in on Clowney and Sternberger, face masks clanging up against each other as they exchanged pleasantries.

The pregame lineups is when he had a panic attack when he was playing, but then you settle in and play a game. Take it at your own pace. I don't need to overdo it.

", "Originally published in the November 2007 issue", "Four miles east of Las Vegas Boulevard,", " well beyond the glitter of the Strip, the Valley High School gym is cool and humid, redolent of floor wax and old socks. The ball pounds on the polished hardwood, the sound echoes off the familiar glazed concrete blocks that form the inner walls. Sneakers squeak. Voices rise and fall, curses and laughter. There is high tragedy and low comedy, often displayed on the same face split seconds apart. There are no fans, no sportswriters. There is no trash talk, no ego, no dispute. There is nothing but this court, this play, these men, this ball -- this peculiar ball, the usual orangey brown, only this one dressed up with the two white rings of international play -- as it traces a high arcing parabola through the air, meanwhile rotating sweetly backward, a shot born of the countless other shots that have preceded it, hundreds of thousands of shots, perhaps millions taken and made over years and years of solitary practice in gyms and driveways and playgrounds from Italy to Philadelphia....", "Kobe Bryant bobs in place on the balls of his feet, holding his pose, frozen for a split second in his red-white-and-blue Zoom Kobe II's, his impossibly long and Pilates-sculpted arm, bark brown and moist and smelling of complimentary hotel lotion, still extended overhead like a kid raising his hand in class. The names of his daughters, Natalia Diamante and Gianna Maria-Onore -- which he pronounces with the proper Italian inflections, the ", "t", " in Natalia more of a hardened ", "th", " sound, the ", "r", " rolled in Maria, a bit jarring against the contrast of his usual dialect, a somewhat put-on version of hip-hop (from age six to thirteen, he lived in Italy, where his father was a pro basketball player; later they moved to Wynnewood, an affluent suburb of Philadelphia) -- are tattooed on the meat of his forearm, which is now facing the basket, his wrist still holding its perfect gooseneck follow-through, a gesture at once delicate and strong, like something from ballet, and so essential, adding as it does the ball's backward rotation, the so-called shooter's touch, which acts as a damper around the rim, helping to ensure that the 9.5-inch-diameter ball will fall with greater frequency into the 18-inch-diameter hole.", "A few years ago, Kobe fractured the fourth metacarpal bone in his right hand. He missed the first fifteen games of the season; he used the opportunity to learn to shoot jump shots with his left, which he has been known to do in games. While it was healing, the ring finger, the one just adjacent to the break, spent a lot of time taped to his pinkie. In the end, Kobe discovered, his four fingers were no longer evenly spaced; now they were separated, two and two. As a result, his touch on the ball was different, his shooting percentage went down. Studying the film, he noticed that his shots were rotating slightly to the right. ", "To correct the flaw, Kobe went to the gym over the summer and made one hundred thousand shots. That's one hundred thousand ", "made,", " not taken. He doesn't practice taking shots, he explains. He practices making them. If you're clear on the difference between the two ideas, you can start drawing a bead on Kobe Bryant, who may well be one of the most misunderstood figures in sports today. It is a tragic misunderstanding, for his sake and for ours. You can blame it on the press. You can blame it on the way the world revolves around fame and money. You can blame it on Kobe himself. ", "Having just celebrated his twenty-ninth birthday, Kobe is about to begin his twelfth season in the NBA. Lately, somewhat grudgingly, people are beginning to acknowledge him as the greatest all-around player still active in the game, mentioned as a peer of Wilt Chamberlain, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan. This year, Kobe will make upwards of $45 million from salary, endorsements, and business ventures. He is constantly in the news, usually on the wrong side of public favor as he continues to play for a once glorious team, the Los Angeles Lakers, that simply doesn't have the manpower right now to will itself into contention. Spending five days with Kobe -- a dozen hours, really, spread over five days -- is to glimpse the life of a highly skilled craftsman. ", "\"Know this above all else....Fully use every point, moment, and hour that you have. Time waits for no man....Seize the day.\"", "He sees his work as his art, his calling. Like Jason Bourne and James Bond, two of his cinematic heroes, Kobe sees himself as an \u00fcber-practitioner: a modern warrior able to solve any problem, able to train his way into dominance. He is the self-styled black mamba, known for its striking ability, aggression, and speed. All those sweaty commercials for Sprite and Nike? Those were his idea. Film my workout, he suggested. That is the essence of me: the guy who guts it out on ", "every", " rep. Kobe's logo, which you will hear more about in the coming years, is called the Sheath. It is drawn to resemble the sheath of a samurai's sword. The sword is the raw talent, Kobe explains. The sheath is the package it's kept in -- everything you go through, your calluses and your baggage, what you learn. ", "\"Scito hoc super omnia....Tempus neminem non manet....Carpe diem,\" ", "he proclaims in Latin (which he learned in elementary school in Italy) on the home page of his Website, ", "KB24.com", ". \"Know this above all else....Fully use every point, moment, and hour that you have. Time waits for no man....Seize the day.\" He wakes at 5:30 in the morning to work out. He eats five times a day, a special diet, stressing not just the ingredients but the way they're cooked. He studies tape of past, present, and world players with the curiosity of a scientist in the lab. (As a kid, he used to study bubble-gum basketball cards in order to see which moves the players were showcasing and \"which of their muscles were firing to make the move happen.\") He can look at a random still photo of himself making a particular shot from a game and tell you exactly when and where and what happened. He has spent hours at a time chasing tennis balls along the floor, running the same patterns again and again on an empty court to get his cuts right for the triangle offense, running steps, running suicides, running distance. ", "After his first season as a pro, when he was the Lakers' sixth man, his summer workouts stressed ways to keep himself mentally involved in the game so he could come off the bench ready to contribute. Before Phil Jackson was ever even mentioned as a possible coach, Kobe contacted Tex Winter, the godfather of the triangle offense, to discuss the intricacies of the play -- just because he was a student of the game and wanted to learn ", "everything.", " In his first season without Shaq, he added fifteen pounds of muscle to handle the heavier workload he expected. This summer, he ", "lost", " eighteen pounds, partially due to his need to watch his cholesterol (a family history of diabetes and heart disease) and partially to take some strain off his body in general and his knees in particular, which have been operated on several times, once in Colorado, an ill-fated trip undertaken with life-altering results. ", "According to his specifications, Kobe's shoes have been designed with a special alloy band inside the arch to cut, he believes, hundredths of a second off his reaction time. For the same reason, he's asked Nike to design a sock-and-shoe system, maybe something like pro soccer players have. That fraction of a second he loses when his foot slides inside the shoe is the time it takes him to blow by a defender, he says. When he ices his knees, he ices the backs as well as the fronts, something that is usually overlooked because it takes longer. He has also asked Nike to design a new kind of warm-up that will wick heat away from his knees and thus enhance recovery time; recovery time, he says with conviction, is the most important element of working out. ", "With one ball and one rebounder, shooting his usual 80 to 90 percent in practice (with no defender), Kobe can make five hundred shots in about sixty minutes. Last year, as a result of all that practice, all those hundreds of thousands of makes, Kobe scored at least fifty points in four consecutive games and led the league in scoring. Two years ago, he turned in an electrifying eighty-one-point performance at home against Toronto, the second highest total on record, after seven-footer Wilt Chamberlain's hundred-point game, all of which came from within fifteen feet of the basket. The reaction to Kobe and his achievements has been puzzling, as it has been since the beginning of his career, when he was voted into the All-Star game as a second-year player (he was the sixth man on the Lakers at the time), and then criticized for inciting an electric duel with the reigning king, Michael Jordan. Perhaps no figure in NBA history has been at once more loved and more reviled than Kobe Bryant.  ", "Now, in the gym, the ball arcs perfectly through the rim and ripples the bottom of the net with a distinctive, thrilling swish", ".", " The moment is unfrozen; time moves on. Kobe nods his head once, almost imperceptibly, as if to say, ", "That's what I'm talkin' about,", " an expression he uses with exuberance when he's in private, when something catches his fancy, when something he believes is borne out. A picture of Kobe seldom seen: his perfect white teeth bared in the large carefree smile of a young man who loves watermelon and those yummy ice cream Kahl\u00faa drinks he and his wife had the other night for dessert at the restaurant in Las Vegas before seeing the show ", "K\u00e0,", " and who is lately in love with the Harry Potter series, which he read at a breakneck pace, trying to beat out his wife, the first books he's read since twelfth grade, when he became obsessed with the sci-fi thriller ", "Ender's Game, ", "about a boy who suffers greatly from isolation and rivalry but ultimately saves the planet", ". ", "The doorbell chimes musically. Kobe and his party have arrived, a contained but complex weather system of youthful energy and expensive perfume. ", "Leading the way is the bodyguard, Rico, a soft-spoken man of unremarkable size, a former LAPD SWAT-team member with a background in martial arts. It is said that Rico (his first name is Cameron; nobody thinks it fits) is trained to hold off a surging crowd long enough for Kobe to get to safety. In a few days, Kobe will be off on a Nike-sponsored tour of Asia, six cities in seven days, where his apparel sells through at almost twice the normal rate and where surging crowds are actually a threat. Worldwide, Kobe apparel outsells that of all other NBA players: The undisputed fact of his statistical dominance seems to outweigh the perceived negatives of his personal history -- the aloofness and selfishness of his early career, the Colorado sexual-assault case that was dropped by prosecutors and the civil suit that was settled out of court, his pissing match with America's beloved clown-giant Shaquille O'Neal, his on-again, off-again insistence on being traded from the Lakers.  ", "Jerry Sawyer is Kobe's marketing manager, six foot two with Malcolm X\u2013style black-frame glasses and an enviable collection of vintage sneakers. His father managed boxers; one of them was Leon Spinks. Jerry carries two different communications devices in the pockets of his oversized shorts. He's one of the four pillars of Zambezi Ink, Kobe's mixed-media ad agency. Like record labels owned by rappers, Zambezi is Kobe's attempt to harness the means of production. Jerry also does a lot of other things for Kobe, from screening press contacts (like me) to dealing with charitable causes, like the After-School All-Stars, an enrichment program for needy kids in L.A., which we visited together one day with the predictable uproar (snapshot: a large cooking class of middle-school-aged black and Latina girls learning to make potato salad, wearing hairnets and plastic gloves and holding knives, screeching at the top of their lungs). ", "Jerry was also charged with making sure that Kobe's black-and-white polka-dot polyester sport coat, custom-made for him by Gucci (as are many of his clothes -- he sits at the dining-room table with his wife and chooses swatches), was pressed and delivered for this photo shoot, which is finally about to happen in this borrowed suite in the Wynn Tower on the Strip in Las Vegas, where Kobe is playing in a summer tournament with the U.S. National Team, attempting to qualify for the Beijing Olympics. The Wynn is booked solid the entire month with basketball royalty.", "Clutching tight to Kobe's hand is the former Vanessa Urbieta Cornejo Laine, twenty-five, she of the infamous $4 million purple makeup diamond. Kobe met Vanessa -- and her mother, who was along as chaperone -- on the set of a video shoot for his rap album, an experiment in cross-marketing that came and went with little fanfare. (Note: Try Googling the lyrics of \"K.O.B.E.,\" performed in duet with the model and TV personality Tyra Banks.) At the time, Vanessa was still a seventeen-year-old high school junior. Kobe himself was only twenty-one, a four-year veteran of the NBA. (You will recall, perhaps, that he took the pop singer Brandy to his own senior prom.) Criticized early in his career for holding himself separate from his teammates -- while they were playing cards, going to clubs, and discussing child-support payments, Kobe was playing pay-per-view Nintendo and ordering room service -- Vanessa seemed more his speed. A sheltered Catholic girl from Orange County, she was as close to her family as he was to his; after residing with his own parents for two years, Kobe had only recently started living on his own. Vanessa had been discovered outside a hip-hop concert by a music producer and had recently begun booking jobs as a dancer and an extra. Kobe tells me unabashedly that when he met her, it was love at first sight. They've been together every possible moment since. The first week, he flooded the administrative office at her high school with flowers for her; he'd pick her up after the bell in his big black Mercedes, causing a stampede of lookie-loos. ", "Vanessa's dark beauty and silken coal-black hair bring to mind the kind of idealized Mexicana frequently seen in tattoos sported by Latino gangbangers. She is known by some as Kobe's Yoko. I have seen her, purring and demure, at Kobe's side in her four-inch heels, her makeup and wardrobe obviously the work of someone with ample time and money on her hands, bringing to mind the image of a tower-kept princess before her mirror, primped to the last eyelash, the last curl, the last bangle. In public, she patiently endures the endless cell-phone pictures taken by all comers, who seem to be lying in wait around every corner, all the time, graciously thanking each and every person who comments on her looks: ", "You're so very kind,", " she will say, her smile royal and Splenda sweet, ", "thank you so very much. ", "And I have seen her go ", "off -- ", "off like a mother bear, like a cornered cat, like a streetwalker on D.C.'s notorious Fourteenth Street strip, zero to sixty in a snap of her manicured fingers, hurling a string of expletives outside the Lakers' dressing room at a fat guy who she perceived had been looking at her daughter in an inappropriate fashion. She might well own the record for the most ", "motherfucker", "s in one sentence. ", "Kobe calls her ", "Mamacita.", " He holds her hand everywhere they go. Sometimes he speaks to her in Spanish. Later this afternoon, when his fruit plate finally arrives, Kobe will ask her: ", "\"Quieres un poquito de fruta, Mamacita?\"", " Kobe and Vanessa are teaching their kids Spanish and English. Sometimes, Kobe throws in some Italian, too. He'll say ", "mangia,", " for instance, telling them to eat. Natalia, four, known as Nani, will look at him like he's crazy. \"You're not saying the ", "Spanish", " word, Daddy,\" she will chide. Nani, of course, is tall for her age. Kobe's older sister, with whom he is very close, is six two. Kobe's mother, Pam, as long as we're doing this, is five ten. His father is six nine. Joseph Washington \"Jellybean\" Bryant, a product of Philly and La Salle University, left school early for the NBA through the \"hardship draft,\" after showing financial need. He was nicknamed for his love of sweets. (He named his son after the pampered Japanese beef: Kobe Bean Bryant.) The rap on Joe is that Kobe didn't get his work ethic from Joe's side of the family. Joe was known as a showboat. He played eight years in the NBA, four with his hometown Philadelphia 76ers, who stuck him under the basket in their old-school, East Coast offense. Jellybean thought of himself as more of a Magic Johnson\u2013type player who was being held back from greatness. ", "In Italy, he became the player he dreamed of being, high scoring (he had two fifty-plus-point games) and beloved; Kobe remembers the fans singing songs about his dad. When Kobe was a toddler, he'd put on his little Sixers uniform and watch his dad on television. Kobe would pretend to play in the game, mimicking his dad's moves, taking time-outs for water when the team did. As Kobe got older, he would end up playing for the same Italian club team as his dad, only in a younger division, wearing the exact same game uniform for real. Frequently, Joe would bring Kobe to his own practices. At age eleven, a team from Bologna tried to buy him from his parents. By thirteen, Kobe was beating his dad's teammates one-on-one. Kobe's daughter is athletic, he can already tell. Nani is playing soccer, a game Kobe still loves. (He picked his U.S.A.\u2013team number, 10, because it was the number of his favorite soccer players -- Pel\u00e9, Maradona, Ronaldinho.) Usually, when he plays games with Nani -- the younger, nicknamed Gigi, is only eighteen months -- Kobe lets her win. Occasionally, he goes ahead and beats her at something. He's noticed she plays a lot harder the next time around. His daughters' all-time favorite game is something called Tickle Man. As you might expect, it involves Daddy.   ", "This weekend, with the Tickle Man in Vegas playing his own big-boy game and Mamacita here to keep him company, the girls are being watched by Vanessa's mom at their big house in guard-gated Ocean Ridge, near Newport Beach, California. The couple has lived there since their marriage in 2001. It is not publicly known whether it is still decorated, as was earlier reported, with his ", "Star Wars", " memorabilia and her Disneyana. Presumably, it is big, with a lot of kids' stuff everywhere. The Bryants do not employ a nanny. ", "After much discussion, the photographer, Nigel Parry, an affable Brit known for his stunning black-and-white pictures, has managed to secure this suite for a photo session. Once the date was set, Jerry e-mailed Esquire's photo editor, saying that Kobe needed to have his own stylist for the shoot and that Vanessa Bryant would fill that role. Esquire assented, offering Vanessa its standard $250. Jerry countered with a request for \"a more typical\" rate somewhat higher. After a bit more back-and-forth, a compromise was happily achieved.", "Now, upon arriving in the suite and making everyone's acquaintance, Kobe and his crew set about ordering the aforementioned fruit platter. Vanessa -- who has asked to be identified as Lady V in the photo credits -- dives right in, voicing her concern with Nigel about his choice of black and white for the photos. As it happens, she has picked out a wardrobe of black-and-white clothes -- prints on prints, everything from the Gucci to the size-16 lizard-skin shoes -- all of it to be dramatically offset by the red paisley on a Neiman Marcus one-hundredth-anniversary tie. \"The brown seamless has gotta go, too,\" she tells Nigel, referring to the backdrop that he and his three assistants have so painstakingly raised. She turns and addresses her husband. \"Kobe,\" she demands, \"did you know it was going to be black and white?\"", "For one long moment, the room becomes very still. All eyes are turned toward the big man. At six six and 207, he dwarfs most of us by nearly a foot. On the court, however, with the rest of his U.S.A. teammates, huge specimens like LeBron James and Dwight Howard, he appears small and wiry, almost delicate.  ", "Kobe looks at his wife intently with his exotic, almond-shaped eyes. \"I didn't know that,\" he says. \"I did not know that.\"", "\"It needs to be color,\" she says with conviction. \"Otherwise, we can't see the ", "red", " in the tie.\"", "\"Can you shoot both?\" Kobe asks Nigel.", "\"We can shoot both,\" Nigel says. ", "\"You do ", "have", " color, right?\" Lady V asks, not convinced.", "\"Ain't no big deal,\" Kobe says, sweet but preemptively, raising his chin, exposing the large escarpment of his Adam's apple just beneath. \"It's all good.\" ", "And so it is. With help from Vanessa and Jerry, Kobe gets dressed and into a seated position. Nigel and his assistants go to work, the flash popping, followed by the electric whine of the recharger. Lady V chooses a couch off to the side. I stand next to her, so as to be close.  ", "\"That looks really sexy,\" she says.", "\"I only have two facial expressions,\" Kobe muses.", "Pop.

I love when he smiles.\"", "\"We're changin' it up over at Nike this time around,\" Kobe says. Yesterday, he had a meeting with Nike designers, his player rep, and his agent, Rob Pelinka, who played college ball with the NCAA Division I\u2013champion Michigan Wolverines -- on the same team as the Fab Five. (He was open on the wing at the moment Chris Webber called the fateful illegal time-out, or so the story goes.) At the meeting, they previewed Kobe's new fall line of apparel. Per his suggestion, it had a retro, old-school theme, circa ", "Yo!

In the days since Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri announced his surprise ", "resignation", " this past weekend, one question has moved quickly to the fore: Is another war brewing in the region?", "The question comes, in large part, because of the strange circumstances surrounding Hariri\u2019s resignation on Saturday. In a televised address from Saudi Arabia, Hariri said that he was stepping down because he feared that he would suffer the same fate as his father, Rafic, twelve years ago. In 2005, during his own term as prime minister, the elder Hariri was killed by a massive car bomb in Beirut by operatives alleged to have been working with Hezbollah and the Assad regime in Syria, both of which have strong connections to Iran. For obvious reasons, Saad Hariri has long had a contentious relationship with Hezbollah, which now holds 12 seats in the Lebanese Parliament, and he is known to have significant business ties with Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s chief regional rival. (He also holds Saudi citizenship.) ", "But analysts were also quick to note that Hariri\u2019s political party, the Future Movement, agreed last month to form a governing coalition with Hezbollah, their erstwhile political opponents. That rapprochement was preceded by a tactical alliance between Hezbollah and the Lebanese Army to fight ISIS on Lebanon\u2019s northern border, but it was understood to have displeased Saudi Arabia. This unhappiness, along with the fact that Hariri\u2019s speech was delivered in Saudi Arabia, made some wonder whether Hariri had been forced by the Saudis to step down, and on what terms. For their part, Lebanese officials are ", "maintaining", " that Hariri is being held against his will.", "Joseph Bahout, a visiting fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, a Washington D.C.-based think tank, told me that up until Saturday, Hariri \u201cwas more or less finding his place in this deal with Hezbollah. Okay, things were not completely rosy, but they were doing deals, and it was working.\u201d For this reason, he believes that Hariri\u2019s resignation was not voluntary. \u201cI think all the info and analysis we have points that Saad was not really willing to resign. He was summoned to Saudi Arabia, given this letter of resignation, and he read it.\u201d", "Further complicating the picture, Hariri\u2019s speech in Riyadh took place just as a massive political purge in the Saudi government was getting underway. Over the weekend, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, commonly known as MbS, consolidated power by ", "arresting", " dozens of powerful businessmen and members of the royal family, whose assets he also seized in what the Saudi government has described as anti-corruption initiative. The purge received the explicit endorsement of Donald Trump, who wrote on Twitter that MbS and his father, King Salman, \u201cknew exactly what they were doing.\u201d (It is possible, too, that Trump knew about the crackdown ahead of time: Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, made an ", "unannounced trip", " to Saudi Arabia a few days before the purge.)", "Trump was not the only one to weigh in on the situation via social media. After Hariri\u2019s speech, the Israeli defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, took to Twitter to denounce Hezbollah and Iran. \u201cLebanon = Hezbollah. Hezbollah = Iran. Iran = Lebanon,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIran endangers the world. Saad Hariri has proved that today.

But the shocking events of the past weekend, along with a deteriorating security situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border, have led to a growing apprehension that Hariri\u2019s resignation is the first step in a chain of events that will end with war between Israel (aided tacitly or openly by Saudi Arabia) and Hezbollah. Since Hariri\u2019s resignation, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates have warned their citizens to leave Lebanon, further stoking fears.", "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the Saudis have taken a big decision to topple the table in Lebanon and start a kind of confrontation with Hezbollah and Iran in the Lebanese theater,\u201d Bahout told me. \u201cThe question is: what are the means and the tools that the Saudis could use? The only rational thing that they could have in mind is that they are betting, or they are aware\u2014because there are contacts between them\u2014that the Israelis are preparing something.\u201d", "Bahout\u2019s suggestion of an alliance between Saudi Arabia and Israel was echoed by a local Hezbollah official I spoke to in south Lebanon not long after Hariri\u2019s resignation. I met the official, who insisted on anonymity, at his house in the dense green hills of south Lebanon. He believes that as prime minister, it would have been impossible for Hariri to make an allegiance with Israel against Hezbollah at the behest of Saudi Arabia. \u201cThe Saudis told him to resign. They don\u2019t want him in the government so that in any upcoming war, he won\u2019t take sides against Israel.\u201d ", "The official also told me that Hezbollah is already well into the process of moving fighters and weaponry from Syria, where they were used in the group\u2019s fight against ISIS, to South Lebanon, in anticipation of a conflict with Israel. \u201cEverybody is coming back to the South,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Hezbollah Special Forces are in Lebanon now.

We want Israel to make a move in order to show what we have for them. They are going to pay a big price.\u201d", "In Dahieh, a southern suburb of Beirut, a Hezbollah commander chuckled grimly when I asked him about Israeli violations of Lebanese airspace, which have been occurring with increasing frequency in recent months. \u201cIf the Israelis think they can keep it up, good luck,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will find the medicine for that, God willing. Everyone will go crazy when we bring down an Israeli jet over Lebanese territory, which is sure to happen in an upcoming war.\u201d ", "Yet for all the bravado of Hezbollah\u2019s rank-and-file, the group\u2019s leadership must know that its prospects in a war against Israel, whose military remains vastly superior, remain dubious. In Lebanon today, Hezbollah\u2019s secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, gave a speech that departed significantly from his usual fire-and-brimstone rhetoric. Nasrallah said that while he believes that Saudi Arabia is trying to incite Israel to strike Lebanon, he also thinks that the cost of such a conflict will deter such a move. As Nasrallah knows well, a new war could easily spark a massive ethnic and sectarian conflict in Lebanon and in the region. What\u2019s more, Israel has been ", "clear", " that it considers the infrastructure of Lebanon fair game in any conflict, which will put Lebanese civilians at great risk.", "Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent and the CEO of the Soufan Group, a security intelligence firm, told me that any movement of fighters and weapons from Syria to Lebanon would suggest that Hezbollah and its allies \u201care comfortable about the situation in Syria, especially after recent gains.\u201d At the same time, he said, preparing for war may be Hezbollah\u2019s means of trying to prevent it. \u201cMoving troops is also sending a message: that we are ready for a conflict, and that can be a form of deterrence in itself.\u201d", "The most recent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, in 2006, was widely viewed as unsuccessful for Israel. But since hostilities ended, Hezbollah has ", "grown", " exponentially in military might. Israel has made no secret of its concern about the group\u2019s increasing power, and has always ", "maintained", " that another war with Hezbollah was ultimately inevitable. According to a former deputy head of Israeli intelligence, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, \u201cIsrael used to formulate its position by saying its aim is to deter Hezbollah. This has changed: Israel's target now is to defeat Hezbollah.\u201d", "But Randa Slim, an analyst at the Middle East Institute, another Washington D.C.-based think tank, says she\u2019s not certain Israel would risk starting a war right now, especially given the damage Hezbollah could inflict upon Israeli civilians. \u201cThe problem is going to be the calculus vis-a-vis the cost in Israel,\u201d Slim told me. \u201cThey are afraid about Hezbollah's missiles targeting their infrastructure. They know that Hezbollah missiles have become much more accurate. The political cost of this war for [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and his leadership may be too high for him to bear in the absence of a quick pathway to a victory over Hezbollah.\u201d", "The Hezbollah official in south Lebanon is not so sure.

With a little help from the French.", ">> PLUS: ", "THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF IRISH WHISKEY", "A Handy Pronunciation Guide:", "Published in the January 2014 issue", "Irish whiskey", " is having its moment. For decades, this venerable, elegant, yet peerlessly approachable spirit found itself eclipsed by its bolder, more brawling Scotch and American cousins. That's over with. Sales have been rising at spectacular rates (last year, they were up an astounding 23 percent in the U. S.), new brands abound, and new distilleries are open, with more in the pipeline. But why?", "A little history: 30 years ago, there was only one company making whiskey in all of Ireland, Irish Distillers Ltd, with two operating distilleries. A hundred years before, when the English whiskey writer Alfred Barnard toured the island's distilleries, he found 28 in operation, many of them quite large. But the 20th century was unkind to the industry, leaving only Bushmills, in Northern Ireland, and Midleton, outside of Cork in the south.", "Bushmills made malt whiskey, distilled thrice in old-school pot stills from 100 percent malted barley and sold mostly under its own name. Midleton made two kinds of whiskey: pure pot-still whiskey, a uniquely Irish type made by distilling malted and unmalted barley together three times in huge, old-fashioned copper stills, and grain whiskey, a light-bodied product made in modern column stills and used for blending. With these (occasionally with a portion of Bushmills malt mixed in), IDL cobbled together all the remaining brands on the market: Jameson, Powers, Paddy, Tullamore Dew, and a handful of smaller local and specialty bottlings. Its main business was in cheap blends, well made but not very exciting, and it wasn't going well\u2014domestic sales were anemic and the export market no better.", "Then, in 1988, the French company Pernod Ricard bought IDL and came up with a strategy: It would take Jameson, the lightest of IDL's blends, and use it to go after vodka and white-rum drinkers, marketing it not as Irish whiskey, or indeed as whiskey at all, but as what it was\u2014a light, smooth, and pleasant drink that went down as easily in shots as it did mixed with ginger ale or anything else. Whiskey geeks were not impressed.", "Pretty much everybody else was, though: Jameson sales took off on afterburners, growing by at least 20 percent a year for the last decade\u2014and this without the monkeying around with age, proof, blend, or price that other whiskey brands had done in similar circumstances. Instead IDL met the exploding demand the old-fashioned way: by making more whiskey. It could do this because back in the 1980s, the same management that had engineered the Pernod sale laid down huge stocks of both the (relatively cheap) grain whiskey and the (expensive) pot-still stuff that went into Jameson, and Pernod Ricard has kept doing the same. This doesn't just mean more Jameson, though. Now that people are interested in Irish whiskey again, IDL has begun paying more attention to its pure pot-still whiskeys\u2014whiskeys made more or less like they were back when there were 28 distilleries in Ireland.", "But now IDL isn't the only company making whiskey in Ireland. For one thing, in 2005 Pernod sold Bushmills to its archrival, spirits giant Diageo, which has kept turning out the malts and blends. But there's also another player in the game: In 1987, an Irish entrepreneur bought an old potato-ethanol plant from the Irish government, installed pot stills and column stills, and set about making malt whiskey and grain whiskey. This new distillery, Cooley, also made a lot more whiskey than it could initially sell\u2014both blends and double-distilled single malts, some of which were made from peated barley. (Neither Bushmills nor Midleton uses any peat in its whiskeys.) Because it had so much whiskey aging away, Cooley was able to supply not only its own brands, Kilbeggan, Tyrconnell, Connemara, Greenore, and Locke's, but also a plethora of start-up brands that jumped in when Irish whiskey began taking off. But then, in 2012, Beam Inc. (as in Jim) stepped in and bought the company. Beam, it appears, would rather try to grow the Cooley brands than sell whiskey to other marketers, leaving them scrambling for product. Some of those now are building their own distilleries. Add the microdistillery Cooley (now called Kilbeggan) operates at the former Locke's distillery in Kilbeggan and a couple others whose whiskey isn't ready for market yet, and you've got a real revival in the making.", ">> PLUS: ", "THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF IRISH WHISKEY", "\n\t\tEvery product was carefully curated by an Esquire editor.

Will the question be rendered moot because so much royal wedding content and speculation causes the world to combust before the two can say their vows in peace? (No. Never.)

And at this point, a strategic \"maybe\" is about all the world can muster, for Prince Harry will not be compressed by our common expectations of what he could, should, and might do at his wedding. Master jeweler Igal Dahan helped streamline that strategic guess for me. \"It\u2019s generally predicted that Prince Harry will not wear a wedding ring,\" says Dahan. \"Most people think that Prince Harry will follow in his grandfather\u2019s and brother\u2019s footsteps and chose not to wear one. If Prince Harry decides to wear a ring, the reason will be because of preference, not tradition.\"", "And this isn't just a royal tradition, but a British one.

This might be surprising to hear in America, where both men and women sporting rings is the norm\u2014a \"tradition\" that might be more modern than generally thought. \"When World War II started, many young men faced long separations from their wives, so wearing a wedding band came to symbolize a man\u2019s fidelity to his bride,\" says Dahan. \"A wedding band was also worn as a reminder of their wives. This was pure romance, a gesture of love and affection that has survived into modern times. Today, most men, especially in the USA, wear wedding bands.\"", "If, however, Prince Harry were to wear a ring,  Josh Marion, vice president of luxury jeweler Ritani and a 20-year diamond expert, predicted that it would be a yellow gold band, to match Markle's engagement ring. Dahan agreed, noting yellow gold is rumored to be Markle's preferred metal. And wearing that ring might just make the case for Harry's penchant for royal rebellion. ", "\"When I think of Prince Harry though, I think of a Prince who doesn\u2019t follow royal tradition as much as his brother and grandfather do,\" says Dahan. \"If Prince Harry were to wear a wedding ring, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me.

Inside the sole is a full size Zoom Bag of air under the Flightspeed, a metal shank that runs the full length of the shoe.", "These two elements play off each other. The sole does not sit flat on the floor, but rather drops down further directly under the bag.

The shoe is always ready to spring back. A heel plug cradles the back of the foot, keeping you locked in and secure.", "Inside the sneaker's neoprene sock there are a series of foam modules designed to grab onto the contours and bones of the foot.

The racing seat grabbed the designer all over and he knew he wanted to add that sort of experience to the sneaker.

The 33 features a circular cutout that lets you see FastFit in action, with a mechanical apparatus clicking along as the support gets tighter and tighter. Pull the eject cord, and you can watch the component parts disengage. It is, frankly, fun as hell to do, regardless of the fact that observation wouldn't really be possible when the sneakers are actually on your foot (and definitely not in a game situation). ", "But really, function is king here. And that function took a lot of time to get exactly right. \"This was the craziest. You can see all the iterations we went through,\" says Tate Keurbis, designer of the 33, while pointing to printouts of design sketches and a photo of a truly impressive pile of rejected samples. \"It took a long time to really perfect the FastFit and get it to work just the way we want it to.\"", "\"Every red line here is a different revision,\" Kuerbis explains. \"That\u2019s all me drawing in a computer.\" ", "That sounds exhausting", ". ", "\"I feel bad for the pattern guy at the factory!\" he laughs. Apparently, he set a bit of a record. Each different iteration of the Air Jordan 33 was labeled with a letter during the initial sampling stage. Kuerbis and company went through the alphabet twice before landing on a final design.", "But that final design, and the way it works? That's what makes all the effort and testing and wrangling media in Los Angeles worth it. Asked what the best part of designing Jordan's new flagship shoe was, Kuerbis doesn't hesitate: \"When I handed it over to an athlete. There\u2019s such a ritual for them to tie their shoes and get it just right. And then you hand them this product and they put it on and in their mind they want to tie it, but instead they pull, and feel it engaging around their foot\u2014and they can\u2019t stop smiling.\"", "The Air Jordan 33 launches at select global retailers and online on October 18.
