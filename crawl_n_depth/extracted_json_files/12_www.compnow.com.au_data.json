It\u2019s made a huge difference in productivity.\u201d", "The new StorNext system provides long-term DR protection seamlessly integrated into the workflow through Quantum Q-Cloud as off-site archive. \u201cWhenever we make a copy on tape, we also set a policy to have StorNext create a second copy in Q-Cloud,\u201d explains Hingert. \u201cWe use the tape for normal recovery and archive access, but Q-Cloud provides indefinite, automated DR protection.
