With a relative or absolute deficiency of sodium they will lose less sodium in sweat, milk and urine. When they sweat less they can become overheated with work which leads to reduced performance and possibly \u201ctying up\u201d.

Hoof quality can be reflective of the horses overall health for the previous twelve months. It can take up to twelve months for full recovery of hoof quality after the diet has been corrected. Farriers can often notice a marked improvement within six to eight weeks of being on a balanced diet as the new hoof grows down from the coronet.", "Poor quality hooves are characterised by a loss of structural integrity and typically have a slow growth rate. Hooves are composed of 90% keratin which is an insoluble protein. The amino acids methionine and cysteine form bonds with the keratin molecules to provide the structure of the hoof. A diet deficient in protein can therefore cause poor hoof quality and poor muscling. Good quality protein sources such as soybean and alfalfa are recommended to help correct protein deficiencies in the diet.", "Minerals are critical for hoof health as well. Calcium is needed for binding keratin but excess can interfere with zinc absorption. Zinc is needed for healthy skin, hair and hooves but excess zinc can interfere with copper absorption. Copper is needed to bind with keratin and ensure the structural integrity of collagen. Manganese is required for the formation, maintenance and repair of cartilage.

Following are some general notes and guidelines to be followed by more detailed notes on specific cases that we have encountered.", "Body condition scoring is traditionally scoring the amount and distribution of fat that a horse has, which is a direct result of the calorie status of the feed they are on. Scoring charts will vary from country to country but most score within the range of one to five. Body scoring for fatness is independent of breed, weight, size and amounts of muscle.", "Excess calories in the diet are stored as fat. Fat is laid down around the neck, withers, shoulders, topline (the area from the shoulders to the tail head), and the ribs (Figure 1). With increasing fat storage these areas fill out and become smoother. Feeling for fat over the ribs is a good guide as it is not then confused with muscle. Combine visual assessment with palpation to assess fat cover. If calories are deficient in the diet the horse will lose weight and become visibly thinner.", "Another area to look at when assessing a horse\u2019s appearance is muscle development. Muscle development is usually assessed along the topline and a protein deficient diet will result in a poor topline. The topline is determined by the amount and balance of amino acids in the diet. Genetics also plays a role in muscle appearance. A horse that is spelling will have a different topline to a horse in full work. A sway back conformation will also affect muscle development along the topline. Aged horses will have a softening of their muscle structures and heavily pregnant mares will appear to have a poorer topline than other horses due to the weight of the foal in the uterus and the softening of ligaments around the tail head just prior to birth. Thoroughbreds tend to have more prominent withers while pony and draft breeds are fleshier.", "Excess protein is not stored in the body and is excreted through the urinary system. If the diet is protein deficient muscle mass is sacrificed and the topline becomes compromised. Muscle development along the topline is the last to develop and the first area to be lost when protein is in short supply. If a horse is very muscle wasted and then put onto a good diet it will redevelop the muscles in the reverse order to when they were lost \u2013 i.e. hindquarter, croup, loin and topline.", "In reality, if a diet is calorie deficient it is usually also protein deficient and the resultant appearance of the horse will reflect this with poor fat cover and wasted muscles. Occasionally a horse will be on a high grain diet (excess calories) but limited roughage (reduced protein quality and quantity) and combined with mineral and vitamin imbalances will give the appearance of very poor health and low body score.", "The appearance of the coat will also give a good indication of condition and health \u2013 a smooth shiny coat with good depth of colour is a very good indicator of basic health and wellness.

She had a high grain diet and very limited access to hay and pasture. She wasn\u2019t calorie deficient but her overall appearance is consistent with protein deficiency, mineral and vitamin imbalances. The overload of grain inhibited normal digestion and dramatically affected mineral absorption and levels especially calcium and phosphorus.

With the addition of Equilibrium / LexveT Mineral Mix he became a score 3 within 4 weeks. In this case he either had an imbalance or deficiency in vitamins or minerals resulting in an inability to utilise his feed properly.", "The desired condition for a horse is a smooth body where the ribs are not visually evident but can be felt easily. The back is level when viewed from on top with no creases or ridges evident. The withers are rounded and the shoulder and neck blend cleanly into the body. The fat at the tailhead will feel spongy and muscles of the hindleg are evident.", "A diet where there is no calorie excess and providing good quality protein and where, just as importantly, the minerals and vitamins are supplied in adequate amounts and in correct ratios will produce a horse that looks a picture of health.", "All these horses (Figure 7, 8 and 9) are well covered with fat and so they appear smooth with no bony protrusions.

This is particularly the case in calcium and phosphorus metabolism in the horse\u2019s body where there are many complex interactions with other minerals and compounds. To reduce a nutritional problem to a simplistic lack of one mineral and supplementing with just that is a flawed approach to nutrition.", "Together they are both essential for sound and normal bone development \u2013 bone structure is 35% calcium and 17% phosphorus. In addition calcium is essential for normal muscle contraction where it is needed to activate potassium ion channels. It is a cell membrane transmitter and regulates enzymes and their actions. Nearly all the body\u2019s calcium is in the bones (99%) and the remaining 1% circulates in the blood stream. Phosphorus is essential for energy production in cells and is part of cell membranes in the form of phospholipids. Approximately 80% of phosphorus is in the bones.", "Most grassy hays contain low to moderate levels of these minerals whilst cereal grains are low in calcium and high in phosphorus. Bran is also a rich source of phosphorus but very low in calcium. Lucerne has a high level of calcium and very low phosphorus. If Lucerne is more than 50% of the ration there will be excessive calcium and protein in the diet. Lucerne contains more than 1% calcium on a dry matter basis whilst grassy hay is approximately 0.6% on a dry matter basis.", "It is generally assumed that approximately 50% of dietary calcium is absorbed. With regards to phosphorus, the phytate phosphorus found in grain is not as effectively utilised as inorganic sources of phosphorus. Phytate phosphorus is hard to digest and because of this it is estimated to be 35% is absorbed.", "The amount of calcium and phosphorus required by horses depends upon their age, stage of growth, pregnancy and lactation status in a mare, and how much work the horse is doing. It is generally accepted that a 500kg horse requires approximately 20 grams calcium and 14 grams phosphorus per day for maintenance needs. This equates to calcium being 0.21% and phosphorus being 0.15% of the daily diet. For a four month old foal this requirement rises to 0.62% for calcium in the diet and 0.34% for phosphorus; for a two year old horse the calcium requirement is 0.28% and the phosphorus required is 0.15% of the daily diet. A pregnant mare in the last 90 days of gestation requires a diet with 0.4% calcium and 0.3% phosphorus. A lactating mare with a foal up to three months of age requires 0.47% calcium and 0.30% phosphorus in the diet. A horse in very hard work requires 0.31% calcium and 0.23% phosphorus in the diet which equals a 48% increase in calcium needs and 53% increase in phosphorus needs over maintenance levels. Any increase in calcium and phosphorus needed by working horses appears to be met by increasing the ration amount to meet energy needs.", "Aged horses over 20 years may require more phosphorus than adult maintenance. Excess calcium intake i.e. more than 1% of the ration should be avoided in older horses.", "It is a fascinating story of the calcium: phosphorus ratio and the dance they do with other minerals and other compounds.", "The calcium-phosphorus ratio is critically important for your horse\u2019s nutritional wellbeing as well as the absolute amount of each mineral fed. All diets should have more calcium than phosphorus \u2013 most requirements yield ratios of 1.2:1 to 1.4:1.", "Diets with less calcium than phosphorus (< 1:1) adversely affect calcium absorption. For every gram of phosphorus eaten by the horse, it must be matched by calcium before the phosphorus can be absorbed across the intestinal wall. Diets high in grain and bran invert the ratio from the ideal. Excess lucerne in the diet also affects the ratio.", "The calcium-phosphorus ratio, the form of calcium, the level of calcium intake and the presence of phytates and oxalates all influence the absorption of calcium. Oxalate levels of 1% in the diet will decrease calcium absorption by 60%. Oxalates are chemical compounds found in grasses such as Kikuyu, Buffel, Pangola, Green Panic and Setaria. The oxalates bind the dietary calcium in the gut and prevent its absorption across the gut wall. Phytates are found in grains and effectively bind the calcium as well.", "If the dietary level of calcium is low the efficiency of absorption increases. If there is excess calcium in the diet less will be absorbed by the gut and more is excreted in the urine.", "If this isn\u2019t confusing enough then consider the role other minerals play \u2013 high magnesium levels in the diet will increase calcium absorption but excess phosphorus will decrease calcium absorption. High zinc levels will decrease calcium and copper absorption while high calcium levels will interfere with copper, manganese, zinc and iron absorption. High calcium levels limit phosphorus absorption and high sodium and chloride levels increase phosphorus absorption by 30-60%.", "Given this complex interaction of minerals and the often ad hoc supplementation of minerals by horse owners, the horses body on the whole seems to regulate mineral levels fairly well providing the diet supplies adequate amounts.", "Calcium levels in the body are regulated by Vitamin D and by the hormones calcitonin and parathyroid hormone. Blood levels of calcium are maintained in a very narrow range to ensure normal neuromuscular activity. Daily requirements of calcium are ideally supplied by the diet. If they are not, then parathyroid hormone is released to take calcium from the bones to circulate in the bloodstream. The body will sacrifice optimal bone strength to maintain normal blood calcium levels. If the blood calcium levels get too high calcitonin and parathyroid hormone act to decrease gut absorption and increase urinary excretion. Vitamin D is needed to help with absorption of calcium and to a lesser extent phosphorus from the gut.", "These can range from clinical to subclinical in presentation. Signs include shifting lameness\u2019s, weak bones, osteopenia (crooked bones and enlarged joints), spontaneous fractures of bones, tying up, and poor performance. These are non-specific signs that can mimic other conditions so a thorough veterinary check is essential. A horse with calcium depletion can take up to twelve months to correct the problem. A spelling horse can have increased needs for minerals as it tries to make up for depletions from poor diets. Low blood calcium levels present as stress tetany, thumps and exhausted horse syndrome \u2013 these are all medical emergencies and require prompt and thorough veterinary workups. Stress tetany occurs in horses with marginal blood calcium levels that are subjected to stress with travel and start twitching, spasming and have rigid, stiff legs. Thumps are a synchronous diaphragmatic flutter where there is very low blood calcium, potassium and chloride from excessive sweating.

Water needs to be drinkable and in sufficient volume to sustain life. Water deprivation is an acute emergency that needs addressing immediately.", "Horses have a biological need for adequate amounts of roughage, protein, energy, minerals and vitamins whether they are going through a drought or not. Most horse owners have networks within their own district as to availability and price of available feed stuffs.

There are many resources available to investigate the suitability and availability of different hays, grains and protein sources.", "One often overlooked aspect of drought feeding is the need to supply of minerals and vitamins. Efficient and effective utilisation of feed eaten by a horse relies upon the health of bacteria in the gut to convert plant material into energy and protein that can be used by the horse\u2019s body. Essential to this is the availability of minerals and vitamins that the bacteria can use as cofactors. Supplying only a few individual minerals will not be sufficient to provide for optimal utilisation of feed. A multimineral and vitamin supplement should be used to maximise the feeds conversion to energy and protein. Plant material grown during a drought or in the lead up to a drought will not be as good a quality as forage grown through a normal season.", "From an economic viewpoint it makes sense to maximise what hay and pasture is available by adding a multimineral and vitamin supplement to the diet.", "Equilibrium has been used by many horse owners in drought situations and they comment on how well their horses look and feel despite the poor quality of the roughage they are eating.

Targeted supplementation specifically for hoof health will often result in poor outcomes due to continuing imbalance of nutrients.", "Horses will show dietary deficiencies and imbalances in many different ways \u2013 some, for example, will present with poor quality hoof while others will have faded coats, poor feed conversion or reduced performance. Hoof quality can be reflective of the horses overall health for the previous twelve months. It can take up to twelve months for full recovery of hoof quality after the diet has been corrected. Farriers can often notice a marked improvement within six to eight weeks of being on a balanced diet as the new hoof grows down from the coronet.", "Poor quality hooves are characterised by a loss of structural integrity and typically have a slow growth rate. Hooves are composed of 90% keratin which is an insoluble protein. The amino acids methionine and cysteine form bonds with the keratin molecules to provide the structure of the hoof. A diet deficient in protein can therefore cause poor hoof quality and poor muscling. Good quality protein sources such as soybean and alfalfa are recommended to help correct protein deficiencies in the diet.", "Minerals are critical for hoof health as well. Calcium is needed for binding keratin but excess can interfere with zinc absorption. Zinc is needed for healthy skin, hair and hooves but excess zinc can interfere with copper absorption. Copper is needed to bind with keratin and ensure the structural integrity of collagen. Manganese is required for the formation, maintenance and repair of cartilage. Selenium is also essential for hoof health, care needs to be taken in the levels fed as it can be toxic in excess. These are just examples of the complexities of nutrition and the risks of just feeding one or two minerals to the exclusion of others.", "Biotin is a vitamin needed for hoof health \u2013 a deficiency will lead to poor quality shelly hooves (brittle horn). Horses manufacture their own B Group vitamins (including biotin) in the hind gut. Horses with a healthy digestive system will manufacture adequate levels of biotin for their needs. A healthy digestive system requires high roughage, low concentrate diet with a complete mineral \u2013vitamin supplement such as Equilibrium LexveT Mineral Mix.", "Horses that are stressed through illness, high workloads, and low hay-high grain diets may benefit from additional Vitamin B supplementation.", "Improving hoof health requires a diet that will improve the overall health and wellbeing of the horse \u2013 the Equilibrium LexveT feeding program recommends always feeding good quality hay or pasture on an ad lib basis , minimal use of grains, pellets and coarse mix, and use a multimineral vitamin supplement at all times such as Equilibrium LexveT Mineral Mix", "Phone:\u00a01300 720 377", "Phone\u00a0(International):", "\n+61 7 3200 4844", "Fax:\u00a0+61 7 3200 4847", "Mail:\u00a0 PO Box 4605", "\nLoganholme DC", "\nQLD 4129 Australia", "Horse Owner Enquiries", "\n(Product and Nutrition Advice):\u00a00800 442 450", "Placing Orders for", "\nEquilibrium Product:\u00a009 829 0456", "Fax:\u00a009 828 1599", "Mail:\u00a0Private Bag 47908", "\nPonsonby", "\nAuckland", "Phone: +44 1995 672241", "Mail: The Weind,", "\nGreat Eccleston, Preston.", "\nPR3 0ZU", "\nUnited Kingdom", "Phone:\u00a00353 90643 9739", "Fax:\u00a001635 41678", "Mail:\u00a0Creggan, Glasson,", "\nAthlone, Co.

With a relative or absolute deficiency of sodium they will lose less sodium in sweat, milk and urine. When they sweat less they can become overheated with work which leads to reduced performance and possibly \u201ctying up\u201d. Chronic lack of sodium over weeks and months leads to weight loss, weakness and Pica which is excessive licking or chewing of dirt, trees and other objects to try to satisfy their craving for salt.

It is needed for normal bone development, the formation of elastin which lines blood vessels, blood manufacture, pigment formation, and for normal reproductive and immune system function.", "It is generally accepted that horses require from 10-30 mg copper/kg of dry matter fed per day. Forage copper levels vary widely from 3-20mg/kg dry matter with most grasses and hays around 9mg/kg dry matter. Most feeds would be slightly deficient especially for pregnant mares and growing horses. Copper toxicity is rarely a problem in horses so it is generally recommended to supplement your horses feed with a multimineral supplement that contains copper.", "Secondary copper deficiency occurs when other minerals interfere with copper absorption. Incorrect and excess supply of zinc, iron, cadmium, molybdenum and sulphur will cause a relative copper deficiency to occur.", "In a young growing horse osteochondritis dissecans (more commonly known as OCD \u2013 joint disorder) is due in part to a copper deficiency.

This is particularly the case in calcium and phosphorus metabolism in the horse\u2019s body where there are many complex interactions with other minerals and compounds. To reduce a nutritional problem to a simplistic lack of one mineral and supplementing with just that is a flawed approach to nutrition.", "Together they are both essential for sound and normal bone development \u2013 bone structure is 35% calcium and 17% phosphorus. In addition calcium is essential for normal muscle contraction where it is needed to activate potassium ion channels. It is a cell membrane transmitter and regulates enzymes and their actions. Nearly all the body\u2019s calcium is in the bones (99%) and the remaining 1% circulates in the blood stream. Phosphorus is essential for energy production in cells and is part of cell membranes in the form of phospholipids. Approximately 80% of phosphorus is in the bones.", "Most grassy hays contain low to moderate levels of these minerals whilst cereal grains are low in calcium and high in phosphorus. Bran is also a rich source of phosphorus but very low in calcium. Lucerne has a high level of calcium and very low phosphorus. If Lucerne is more than 50% of the ration there will be excessive calcium and protein in the diet. Lucerne contains more than 1% calcium on a dry matter basis whilst grassy hay is approximately 0.6% on a dry matter basis.", "It is generally assumed that approximately 50% of dietary calcium is absorbed. With regards to phosphorus, the phytate phosphorus found in grain is not as effectively utilised as inorganic sources of phosphorus. Phytate phosphorus is hard to digest and because of this it is estimated to be 35% is absorbed.", "The amount of calcium and phosphorus required by horses depends upon their age, stage of growth, pregnancy and lactation status in a mare, and how much work the horse is doing. It is generally accepted that a 500kg horse requires approximately 20 grams calcium and 14 grams phosphorus per day for maintenance needs. This equates to calcium being 0.21% and phosphorus being 0.15% of the daily diet. For a four month old foal this requirement rises to 0.62% for calcium in the diet and 0.34% for phosphorus; for a two year old horse the calcium requirement is 0.28% and the phosphorus required is 0.15% of the daily diet. A pregnant mare in the last 90 days of gestation requires a diet with 0.4% calcium and 0.3% phosphorus. A lactating mare with a foal up to three months of age requires 0.47% calcium and 0.30% phosphorus in the diet. A horse in very hard work requires 0.31% calcium and 0.23% phosphorus in the diet which equals a 48% increase in calcium needs and 53% increase in phosphorus needs over maintenance levels. Any increase in calcium and phosphorus needed by working horses appears to be met by increasing the ration amount to meet energy needs.", "Aged horses over 20 years may require more phosphorus than adult maintenance. Excess calcium intake i.e. more than 1% of the ration should be avoided in older horses.", "It is a fascinating story of the calcium: phosphorus ratio and the dance they do with other minerals and other compounds.", "The calcium-phosphorus ratio is critically important for your horse\u2019s nutritional wellbeing as well as the absolute amount of each mineral fed. All diets should have more calcium than phosphorus \u2013 most requirements yield ratios of 1.2:1 to 1.4:1.", "Diets with less calcium than phosphorus (< 1:1) adversely affect calcium absorption. For every gram of phosphorus eaten by the horse, it must be matched by calcium before the phosphorus can be absorbed across the intestinal wall. Diets high in grain and bran invert the ratio from the ideal. Excess lucerne in the diet also affects the ratio.", "The calcium-phosphorus ratio, the form of calcium, the level of calcium intake and the presence of phytates and oxalates all influence the absorption of calcium. Oxalate levels of 1% in the diet will decrease calcium absorption by 60%. Oxalates are chemical compounds found in grasses such as Kikuyu, Buffel, Pangola, Green Panic and Setaria. The oxalates bind the dietary calcium in the gut and prevent its absorption across the gut wall. Phytates are found in grains and effectively bind the calcium as well.", "If the dietary level of calcium is low the efficiency of absorption increases. If there is excess calcium in the diet less will be absorbed by the gut and more is excreted in the urine.", "If this isn\u2019t confusing enough then consider the role other minerals play \u2013 high magnesium levels in the diet will increase calcium absorption but excess phosphorus will decrease calcium absorption. High zinc levels will decrease calcium and copper absorption while high calcium levels will interfere with copper, manganese, zinc and iron absorption. High calcium levels limit phosphorus absorption and high sodium and chloride levels increase phosphorus absorption by 30-60%.", "Given this complex interaction of minerals and the often ad hoc supplementation of minerals by horse owners, the horses body on the whole seems to regulate mineral levels fairly well providing the diet supplies adequate amounts.", "Calcium levels in the body are regulated by Vitamin D and by the hormones calcitonin and parathyroid hormone. Blood levels of calcium are maintained in a very narrow range to ensure normal neuromuscular activity. Daily requirements of calcium are ideally supplied by the diet. If they are not, then parathyroid hormone is released to take calcium from the bones to circulate in the bloodstream. The body will sacrifice optimal bone strength to maintain normal blood calcium levels. If the blood calcium levels get too high calcitonin and parathyroid hormone act to decrease gut absorption and increase urinary excretion. Vitamin D is needed to help with absorption of calcium and to a lesser extent phosphorus from the gut.", "These can range from clinical to subclinical in presentation. Signs include shifting lameness\u2019s, weak bones, osteopenia (crooked bones and enlarged joints), spontaneous fractures of bones, tying up, and poor performance. These are non-specific signs that can mimic other conditions so a thorough veterinary check is essential. A horse with calcium depletion can take up to twelve months to correct the problem. A spelling horse can have increased needs for minerals as it tries to make up for depletions from poor diets. Low blood calcium levels present as stress tetany, thumps and exhausted horse syndrome \u2013 these are all medical emergencies and require prompt and thorough veterinary workups. Stress tetany occurs in horses with marginal blood calcium levels that are subjected to stress with travel and start twitching, spasming and have rigid, stiff legs. Thumps are a synchronous diaphragmatic flutter where there is very low blood calcium, potassium and chloride from excessive sweating. The phrenic nerve becomes hyperactive and irritable and the diaphragm thumps in", "synchrony with the heartbeat. Exhausted horse syndrome occurs when a horse has been pushed with work way beyond its ability to cope metabolically and is in multi mineral depletion.", "Calcium excess particularly through the addition of excess lucerne (alfalfa) in the diet can lead to enteroliths (intestinal stones).", "High phosphorus levels will lead to chronic calcium deficiency which leads to nutritional hyperparathyroidism (big head).

Following are some general notes and guidelines to be followed by more detailed notes on specific cases that we have encountered.", "Body condition scoring is traditionally scoring the amount and distribution of fat that a horse has, which is a direct result of the calorie status of the feed they are on. Scoring charts will vary from country to country but most score within the range of one to five. Body scoring for fatness is independent of breed, weight, size and amounts of muscle.", "Excess calories in the diet are stored as fat. Fat is laid down around the neck, withers, shoulders, topline (the area from the shoulders to the tail head), and the ribs (Figure 1). With increasing fat storage these areas fill out and become smoother. Feeling for fat over the ribs is a good guide as it is not then confused with muscle. Combine visual assessment with palpation to assess fat cover. If calories are deficient in the diet the horse will lose weight and become visibly thinner.", "Another area to look at when assessing a horse\u2019s appearance is muscle development. Muscle development is usually assessed along the topline and a protein deficient diet will result in a poor topline. The topline is determined by the amount and balance of amino acids in the diet. Genetics also plays a role in muscle appearance. A horse that is spelling will have a different topline to a horse in full work. A sway back conformation will also affect muscle development along the topline. Aged horses will have a softening of their muscle structures and heavily pregnant mares will appear to have a poorer topline than other horses due to the weight of the foal in the uterus and the softening of ligaments around the tail head just prior to birth. Thoroughbreds tend to have more prominent withers while pony and draft breeds are fleshier.", "Excess protein is not stored in the body and is excreted through the urinary system. If the diet is protein deficient muscle mass is sacrificed and the topline becomes compromised. Muscle development along the topline is the last to develop and the first area to be lost when protein is in short supply. If a horse is very muscle wasted and then put onto a good diet it will redevelop the muscles in the reverse order to when they were lost \u2013 i.e. hindquarter, croup, loin and topline.", "In reality, if a diet is calorie deficient it is usually also protein deficient and the resultant appearance of the horse will reflect this with poor fat cover and wasted muscles. Occasionally a horse will be on a high grain diet (excess calories) but limited roughage (reduced protein quality and quantity) and combined with mineral and vitamin imbalances will give the appearance of very poor health and low body score.", "The appearance of the coat will also give a good indication of condition and health \u2013 a smooth shiny coat with good depth of colour is a very good indicator of basic health and wellness. Dull, rough and washed out colours indicate dietary imbalances that need to be addressed.", "A healthy well fed horse will have a bright demeanour and be alert and interested in the environment.

She had a high grain diet and very limited access to hay and pasture. She wasn\u2019t calorie deficient but her overall appearance is consistent with protein deficiency, mineral and vitamin imbalances. The overload of grain inhibited normal digestion and dramatically affected mineral absorption and levels especially calcium and phosphorus. Notice her lethargic demeanour, poor coat quality and dull eyes.

With the addition of Equilibrium / LexveT Mineral Mix he became a score 3 within 4 weeks. In this case he either had an imbalance or deficiency in vitamins or minerals resulting in an inability to utilise his feed properly.", "The desired condition for a horse is a smooth body where the ribs are not visually evident but can be felt easily. The back is level when viewed from on top with no creases or ridges evident. The withers are rounded and the shoulder and neck blend cleanly into the body. The fat at the tailhead will feel spongy and muscles of the hindleg are evident.", "A diet where there is no calorie excess and providing good quality protein and where, just as importantly, the minerals and vitamins are supplied in adequate amounts and in correct ratios will produce a horse that looks a picture of health.", "All these horses (Figure 7, 8 and 9) are well covered with fat and so they appear smooth with no bony protrusions.

Plant matter can contain from 0-2 mg/kg dry matter of iodine while some kelps can have up to 1850mg/kg dry matter.", "How much iodine does my horse require?", "Horses appear to have a requirement of 0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg dry matter \u2013 a horse eating 10kg dry matter per day could ingest from zero to 20 mg of iodine per day when it would appear their needs are from 1 to 6 mg per day. Toxic levels appear to be in the 40 \u2013 50mg per day range so most horses are getting safe and adequate amounts of iodine when their entire dietary intake is looked at. Most horses are also supplemented with a range of feed concentrates and mineral supplements that would top up their iodine intake.", "Iodine excess is more of a problem than iodine deficiencies due to excessive feeding of kelp supplements in most cases. Given the relative lack of iodine in soils and plants most horses appear to be very efficient at absorbing, storing and using the iodine that is available in their feed. Iodized salt is also used by a lot of owners as a supplement but for some horses it is still insufficient for their needs. This may be because iodine absorption and use may be reliant on other factors apart from what iodized salt provides.", "How do we measure iodine levels?", "Due to the difficulty of measuring iodine levels in the horse directly an indirect way of assessing iodine levels is to measure T3 and T4 levels. Should a horse develop goitre, its overall health status should be assessed as well as the diet that it is on. Some horses can develop goitre even though there is adequate iodine in the diet due to malabsorption or altered metabolic needs e.g. ageing horses and ponies, heavily pregnant mares on poor diets or other disease conditions like Cushing\u2019s Disease.", "Phone:\u00a01300 720 377", "Phone\u00a0(International):", "\n+61 7 3200 4844", "Fax:\u00a0+61 7 3200 4847", "Mail:\u00a0 PO Box 4605", "\nLoganholme DC", "\nQLD 4129 Australia", "Horse Owner Enquiries", "\n(Product and Nutrition Advice):\u00a00800 442 450", "Placing Orders for", "\nEquilibrium Product:\u00a009 829 0456", "Fax:\u00a009 828 1599", "Mail:\u00a0Private Bag 47908", "\nPonsonby", "\nAuckland", "Phone: +44 1995 672241", "Mail: The Weind,", "\nGreat Eccleston, Preston.", "\nPR3 0ZU", "\nUnited Kingdom", "Phone:\u00a00353 90643 9739", "Fax:\u00a001635 41678", "Mail:\u00a0Creggan, Glasson,", "\nAthlone, Co.

Supplementing with just one or two minerals and not with others is highly likely to cause problems with imbalances in the other vital nutrients. Very rarely is a horse\u2019s diet deficient in just one mineral and rarely does a nutritional medical problem respond to the addition of just one or two minerals. Whilst the action of individual minerals can be described in the functioning of the normal horse\u2019s body never forget that it needs other cofactors to enable it to work.", "An informed, astute and observant owner is the best judge of how a horse is performing on the diet it is on and can correct it appropriately as required.", "Magnesium is vital for correct nervous system and muscle function, energy metabolism and production, and is directly required for hundreds of chemical reactions in the body daily. An absolute or relative deficiency of magnesium manifests as horses with nervous, wary or excited behaviours and muscle tremors. There is poor work tolerance with tying up likely. Excess magnesium is excreted in the urine and there is very little magnesium stored in the body. Major overdoses of magnesium can lead to renal and cardiac problems.", "Most magnesium needs are acquired through forage \u2013 they absorb 40 to 60% of the magnesium in pasture plants and acquire 60% to 100% of daily needs through this source.", "Magnesium deficiency is likely when there is strong grass growth as in spring or when winter pastures are fertilised and grass grows well \u2013 grasses under these conditions of rapid growth are likely to be low in magnesium, sodium and soluble carbohydrates and relatively high in nitrogen and potassium. High potassium slows magnesium uptake while high sodium helps magnesium uptake. A relative magnesium deficiency is likely when dietary potassium is too high. Calcium, phosphorus and fats in the diet also influence the ability of the horse to utilise and store magnesium.", "Magnesium can be supplemented in the diet with magnesium oxide, magnesium carbonate, magnesium sulphate and magnesium-L-aspartate. It has been estimated that maintenance needs of magnesium for horses is 13-15 mg/kg/day \u2013 this is increased 1.5 to 2 times for growing horses, lactating mares and horses in medium to heavy work due to losses in sweat.", "Studies have shown magnesium oxide is absorbed at a rate of 70%. Magnesium oxide has the chemical composition of MgO, where one magnesium atom (Mg) is bound to one oxygen atom (O). By weight, magnesium oxide is 60.3% magnesium. This means that for a horse to absorb 15mg it would require 35mg of magnesium oxide. Chelated magnesium is magnesium bound to an amino acid which makes it more easily absorbed. For example, chelated magnesium (magnesium-l-aspartate) achieves close to 100% absorption. The issue is that the concentration of magnesium in magnesium-l-aspartate is low at just 15.6%. This means 96mg of magnesium-l-aspartate would need to be supplemented for a horse to absorb 15mg. Due to the expensive nature of chelated magnesium products the inorganic form of magnesium oxide provides excellent value due to the high levels of concentration and high absorption rate. There is vigorous debate about chelated magnesium vs. inorganic forms of magnesium particularly in regard to absorption. What is of particular interest is that magnesium naturally found in plants is absorbed at a rate of between 40 \u2013 60%. Comparing this to the absorption of inorganic forms (magnesium oxide, magnesium carbonate, magnesium sulphate) it shows that both the inorganic and chelated forms of magnesium can achieve absorption superior to that of magnesium naturally found in pasture.", "Phone:\u00a01300 720 377", "Phone\u00a0(International):", "\n+61 7 3200 4844", "Fax:\u00a0+61 7 3200 4847", "Mail:\u00a0 PO Box 4605", "\nLoganholme DC", "\nQLD 4129 Australia", "Horse Owner Enquiries", "\n(Product and Nutrition Advice):\u00a00800 442 450", "Placing Orders for", "\nEquilibrium Product:\u00a009 829 0456", "Fax:\u00a009 828 1599", "Mail:\u00a0Private Bag 47908", "\nPonsonby", "\nAuckland", "Phone: +44 1995 672241", "Mail: The Weind,", "\nGreat Eccleston, Preston.", "\nPR3 0ZU", "\nUnited Kingdom", "Phone:\u00a00353 90643 9739", "Fax:\u00a001635 41678", "Mail:\u00a0Creggan, Glasson,", "\nAthlone, Co.
