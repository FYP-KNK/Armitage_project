They occur in all industries, but since they are less structured than graduate programs, they are the main source of graduate employment in the small to medium business market. With these jobs, graduates are hired to perform a role at a full-time, part-time, casual or contracting basis. Common titles for graduate jobs include:", "Entry-level jobs provide a vast employment pool for university graduates, with a large variety of positions and options to choose from. They provide practical experience in a variety of skills, and the chance to build a professional reputation, as well as the chance to decide exactly what direction to take career-wise.", "Applying for a Graduate Job ", "Entry-level employers assess candidates\u2019 relevant knowledge and experience, seeking proof of their ability to perform the job. The first indicator of an applicant\u2019s suitability is their CV, which should include their academic achievements, work experience and extra-curricular activities.", "When crafting your CV, it is important to not underestimate your abilities. Know your strengths, and match them to what the job requires. Usually a bachelor\u2019s degree (with a Credit or Distinction average) is sufficient academic qualification for a graduate job.", "Think creatively about your experiences. For example, part-time work yields not only technical skills, but teaches desirable \u201csoft skills\u201d like collaboration, time-management and leadership. Think about how this applies to your desired job. That said; do not over-sell yourself. Stretching the truth in a CV may get you an interview, but the lies will be exposed when it comes to performing the job.", "Assuming your resume impresses the employer the next step will be an interview. Employees use interviews to gain a better understanding of their candidate\u2019s knowledge and experience, critical thinking and creativity; and in particular their communication skills and organisational fit. Make sure you do some research into the company beforehand, and practice answering common interview questions so as to prepare yourself to speak with confidence. On the day; dress to impress (in business-attire). Answer all questions honestly. At the end you will be given the opportunity to ask the employer some questions yourself. Showing interest in the day-to-day running of the business, learning and development prospects of the job and future direction of the company helps to convince the employer that you have genuine enthusiasm for the job, and that you will fit in well with the organisation\u2019s team.", "Graduate Programs ", "Graduate programs differ from graduate jobs in that they are structured, often providing some formal education (like a professional certification, or a diploma) as well as guided training in the organisation, mentoring, and access to senior management. Graduate programs are usually full-time, and go for 12 months or more. They require significant investment in time and money, so only very large organisations (like big corporations and the government) can afford to offer them. Because of this substantial investment their entry requirements are very high, and only the best candidates will succeed in getting a position.", "A graduate program grooms candidates for a future in leadership and senior management. Since they are a boost on the corporate ladder, they are in high demand among graduates. However, failing to get a position in a graduate program does not discount someone from having a successful career since that ultimately depends on work quality, communication, talent, leadership, teamwork and networking.", "The most in-demand graduate programs are with large corporations like the Big Four accounting firms, Telstra and BHP Billiton.

This strategy will help you learn more about the kinds of skills and experience organisations seek. In 2013, the average successful candidate submitted applications to different companies. However, this average is indicative of a wide spread \u2013 while 28% of successful applicants made over ten applications, 19% were successful with only a single application.", "Relevant tertiary qualification is important, with most successful applicants to graduate programs having studied commerce (including accounting, economics, business management, finance and marketing), law, engineering or political science. Many large companies offer \u201cgeneralist\u201d recruitment programs, for which candidates from all disciplines are invited to apply, since a diverse knowledge-base is an asset.", "Companies offering graduate programs seek applicants with high academic achievement, and to that end candidates with scholarships and prizes are at an advantage. 54% of successful applicants in 2013 had a scholarship, prize or some kind of financial support from an organisation. In addition, companies want evidence of leadership, self-motivation, dedication and initiative. Part-time work is a good indicator of these qualities, and is also a source of practical experience. 86% of graduates successfully hired to a graduate program had worked part-time at some point during university. Other extra-curricular activities common to successful candidates include volunteer work, vacation work/ internship, relevant industry work experience and participation in student societies.", "Application to a graduate program typically involves multiple steps, such as completing an online application, undertaking a skills assessment, a telephone interview and a face-to-face interview. At each point the applicant is screened before progressing to the next level. Although the application process is long and complex, the companies design the stages as much as possible to enable the candidate\u2019s best qualities to shine. The tests and interviews will be challenging, but interactive and enjoyable. Shortlisted candidates may be invited to networking events to meet more of the company staff, ask questions of previous graduates, and find out more of how the business works and whether the job is right for them.", "Finally, if a candidate passes every stage of the application process, they will be sent a formal offer by letter, including the full commencement details. Typically there will be a wait of two and a half months between the start of an application and receipt of an offer, and successful candidates begin work between January and March the following year (with 56% of candidates beginning work in February).", "Graduate Program Key Locations: ", "Graduate Program Key Industries: ", "Fast track your professional ", "career", " by joining GradConnection", "Search", "Enter an employer or university you want to find in our search bar.", "When you sign up for GradConnection you know you are becoming a member of the biggest and most popular student and graduate careers website in Australia.

Not only does it help pay the bills, and start savings for the future, but it provides students with valuable experience that will look good on their resumes, and teaches skills that will be valuable for future life and work with employers.", "There are many different kinds of part-time jobs available to university students. The most common categories are listed below:\u00a0", "Within each of these categories are a variety of overlapping jobs that may be available to students. For example, in the retail category a worker may be both a salesperson and a customer service representative. This will depend on the size of the organisation \u2013 smaller businesses demand more flexibility from their workers \u2013 for example a corner coffee shop may require the barista to help as one of the wait-staff during busy periods, whereas a larger chain store is more likely to have specialised workers for each role.", "There is a constant demand for part-time or casual workers in the Australian economy, both from small businesses and large organisations. This is especially true in the hospitality and retail industries \u2013 corporate giants like Woolworths, McDonalds, Starbucks and Bunnings as well as local boutique stores, family grocers and cafes all require part-time staff. Administration and data entry has the largest potential market \u2013 including non-profit, services and the public sector as well as private enterprise. For the call centre and marketing categories the employers tend to be large companies, like Telstra.", "The kinds of jobs advertised as part-time usually do not require specialised professional skills, certain specialised jobs may require marketing, accounting, IT or other experience. More general skills, applicable across multiple sectors include:", "Payment for part-time work will vary depending on the industry, size of organisation and responsibilities involved. The minimum wage is $16.87 per hour. Casual work will offer higher rates, usually starting from around $18-22 per hour.", "Despite the prevalence of part-time work in the economy, it can seem difficult to find job opportunities. One of the main reasons for this is that a lot of part-time or casual work is required by organisations (such as small businesses) on an ", "ad-hoc", " basis, meaning they don\u2019t advertise on the web or in print publications like the \u201cclassified\u201d section of the local paper. Instead, the organisation may put up a \u201cstaff wanted\u201d sign in their window, or not advertise at all. The solution in this case is to approach a variety of small businesses in your neighbourhood (such as shops or coffee shops) and express your interest in a part-time job. At this point they may not need your services, but will usually be impressed with your initiative. If you submit your resume to them, they will keep you in mind next time a staff position opens up. Approaching small businesses directly this way makes their job much easier, as often they have little time or money to spend on recruitment efforts, and so will be more likely to look at your application with favour. The direct approach is the best way to find part-time jobs in the SME sector, but it is also worth trying for larger organisations that don\u2019t advertise part-time work.", "Larger organisations may have a structured employment application process. Examples include food retailers like KFC, Domino\u2019s Pizza and Baker\u2019s Delight \u2013 all of which have online application processes. An aspiring student submits their resume for a position in one of the local franchises. Sometimes you will be able to do this even if no positions are currently available (in which case the organisation will keep the application on hold for the next available job). Other times you will have to keep checking back to see when the applications open.", "The last method of part-time job searching is checking job websites and print classifieds for part-time positions. While some fantastic jobs (potentially higher-paid ones) may be found this way, these opportunities represent only a proportion of the massive job market out there. This is because unlike graduate or full-time work, most part-time employers don\u2019t pay much to advertise their part-time jobs (especially if they can get the job filled without advertising). In addition, some of the \u201cjobs\u201d found online are scams too, offering \u201cexperience\u201d for work that really should be paid. Because many students believe that scouring online for work opportunities is the best way to find a part-time job, those jobs that ", "are", " advertised will also have many more people competing with them than the average unadvertised local job. In conclusion, searching print and online is but one method that a determined job-seeker should employ.", "Finding a job while on a student visa can be a challenge, as there are more limited opportunities (and work hours) available to international students. During term time, international students may not work more than 40 hours per fortnight, however during holiday period there are no restrictions on hours worked.

For the switched-on student, participation in an internship or vacation program is an important step along the career pathway. Some confusion exists as to the difference between an \u201cinternship\u201d and a \u201cvacation program\u201d. While they are similar in that they provide training and experience, a vacation program is more specific than other internships in structure, timing and size of organisation.", "An internship is a supervised (and often paid) work placement which provides the intern with training and experience relevant to their field of study. Internships take many forms, ranging in duration from a few weeks to six-months or more. The length of the work placement depends on the organisation. Some internships may count for academic credit towards a relevant degree. For example, in engineering, students are required to complete work placement before they are allowed to graduate.", "Internships may be structured in a variety of ways:", "Paid internship", "Paid internships are the most desirable for students, not only because they financially reimburse them for their work, but because they are linked to higher employment rates and higher graduate salaries than unpaid internships. Most internship programs with medium-to-large local corporations are paid, often calculated at a percentage based on their current stage in their tertiary education. Small-to medium businesses can also offer paid internships, although perhaps not at the same rate. Large organisations may have a structured training and development internship program that guides the student as they complete their work experience. They may also involve a lot of \u201cmenial\u201d work such as getting coffees and printing documents. Internships at SMEs tend to be less structured, but may provide a student with the opportunity to \u201cpick up\u201d and learn from example the habits and practices of business owners, managers and employees across all functions of the business, to whom they perhaps would not have access if they were employed in a specific subsection of a larger company.", "Businesses aren\u2019t the only organisations to offer paid internships either. Non-profit organisations, despite having less money to work with, may still offer paid work because the work that a paid intern provides to the organisation is of higher quality than that of an unpaid worker.", "Unpaid internship", "Unpaid internships are on the decline in Australia, after several crackdowns by Fair Work for exploitation of students. The formal aspect of an internship and the type of work that is usually expected (more complex compared to a \u201cwork experience\u201d job and involving responsibility equal to that of a paid employee) means that interns are entitled to at least a minimum/industry award wage under the Fair Work Act 2009, unless they are undertaking \u201cvocational work\u201d. The majority of internships do not fall under \u201cvocational work\u201d, which is defined under the Act as unpaid work that is a required for the completion of an authorised VET Australian-based education or training course.", "Volunteer work is different to an \u201cunpaid internship\u201d, as it is done for the cause rather than for money or for the training. Volunteer work has none of the formal training that is expected in an internship. This kind of work however can give practical experience in many different skills, and is an asset on a resume.", "Paid-for-internship (international internship)", "Some organisations offer opportunities to intern overseas in a large multinational or foreign company. They act to connect students with the foreign employers, and coordinate all the travel, accommodation, orientation and on-site support for the intern\u2019s international placement. While interning with these MNCs provides valuable training, work and intercultural experience, the internship costs at least several thousand dollars. The work at the foreign company is also usually unpaid (because of student visa restrictions and the type of work involved).", "Applying for an internship", "Since there are so many kinds of internships possible, there is no one way to apply. Organisations that have structured internship programs already established can be contacted easily, and candidates need only to send their application to the relevant authorities (whether by mail or online) before the \u201cclosing date\u201d. However many organisations, particularly SMEs, do not specify in the outset whether they offer internships. In these cases the student must be pro-active and contact the organisation (usually by email), respectfully asking whether they would ever consider offering an internship, (detailing what interests them about the company, and pitching what the student can offer them, should they be accepted as an intern). If the organisation shows interest, then the student\u2019s CV should be sent through and all communications should be followed up in a timely manner. An interview will be held as part of the selection process. In the interview, the usual protocols apply \u2013 honesty, interest in the organisation, consideration, the ability to apply one\u2019s own experiences to illustrate things like teamwork and leadership, and fluent communication skills.", "A \u201cvacation program\u201d is a specific type of internship, which usually takes place during the summer vacation period from late November to early March (but which is also sometimes offered in the winter). They are offered to students in their penultimate year and are highly contested, both for the superior work experience and because students that perform well in a vacation program will often be offered a graduate position the following year.", "Features of vacation programs", "Vacation programs usually run for 12 weeks between November and March. Companies that offer these programs make a great effort to provide an exceptional work experience in multiple areas of the company, since they hope that the student will in the future become an asset to their organisation. The student is given opportunities to complete and take responsibility for challenging tasks, and to demonstrate leadership and teamwork. In addition they may go through a structured training and/or \u201cpersonal development\u201d program designed to supplement their professional skills. Mentoring is provided, and \u201cbuddy\u201d programs (in which the student works with an experienced graduate who provides them with guidance and support) are also common. Depending on the industry and organisation, the program may also entail travel to remote locations. For example, vacation work in an engineering, mining or consulting firm often includes travel inter- and intra-state to visit worksites.", "Vacation work is paid work \u2013 students are expected to contribute and add value to the company, and are compensated accordingly. The median pro rata salary for vacation programs in 2014 was $53 000 (which means for 12 weeks\u2019 work a student can earn around $12 230). Because vacationers are so sought-after for graduate programs, (with two-thirds of companies offering graduate programs also offer vacation work), this payment is also designed to give a favourable impression of the company to the student, so that they will want to work there again after they graduate.", "Vacation programs typically cost more to run than other, less structured kinds of internships, and hence are only offered by big corporations and government departments. Because there are less vacation positions available overall (with most companies offering five or fewer positions) and because they are highly regarded by future employers, competition for vacation programs is high, with most companies receiving hundreds of applications each year. Only the very best candidates will be selected as worthy of the company\u2019s investment.", "Recruiters for vacation programs look for students doing a relevant degree, a deep interest in the industry and a passion for the type of work they do. Although usually anyone with an above-credit average will be considered, high academic achievement is advantageous, since it signifies discipline and a good work ethic \u2013 both qualities that employers rate highly. Teamwork and interpersonal skills are especially important, as are strong verbal and written communication skills.", "Applying for a vacation program", "Most applications for summer vacation programs open in February, with deadlines occurring from March/May. Rolling recruitment is becoming more common. In rolling recruitment, candidates may apply at any time of the year, and (if found to be satisfactory) will be hired when the next vacancy occurs. This can give students more flexibility, but may make it more difficult for some to plan their study and be disadvantageous to the structure and timing of the program.", "Application to a vacation program is a multi-stage process that differs among organisations in terms of exact format. The first stage is usually an online application that involves submitting a resume to the company website or email, and may also include a company-specific essay or personal justification as to why the student should be considered for the program. Those who progress to the next stages may be asked to undergo aptitude and/or psychometric testing (which may take place online or at a testing facility). The applicant may be interviewed several times \u2013 via phone or video during the earlier stages of the application \u2013 then in person for the final interview.", "Affirmative action in pre-graduate work", "Certain disadvantaged groups are often targeted for pre-graduate work such as vacation work or internships. Among these groups women and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students are particularly targeted, in an attempt to redress inequalities currently existing in the workplace. Despite this, out of the pre-graduate intake women only make up 40.6% and Aboriginal students 2.9%. Other minorities are even less represented, particularly LGBTQ students, students with disabilities and Torres Strait Islander students. This indicates that although organisations are making an effort, there is still a way to go in establishing true workplace diversity.", "Vacation programs are highly competitive, not only because of their quality work experience but because they have a high likelihood of leading to a graduate position. Because of the significant investment these companies make in their interns, they demand students of the highest quality.Spaces are limited. Application is a rigorous, multi-stage process that in most cases involves submission of a resume, psychometric testing, checking of references, medical examinations and multiple interviews.", "Successful applicants to vacation programs:", "Make sure you mark the application dates so as not to miss out. Many applications for summer vacation programs open in February, closing in March/May. The other window is from June to August. Some firms also hire on a \u201crolling recruitment\u201d basis.
