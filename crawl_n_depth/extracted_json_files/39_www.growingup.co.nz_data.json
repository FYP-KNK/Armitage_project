Growing Up in New Zealand is the country\u2019s largest and most comprehensive longitudinal study, following the lives of nearly 7000 children born in 2009 and 2010 from before they are born until adulthood. We describe the status of these children, who represent the diversity of contemporary NZ pre-schoolers, when they are four and a half years of age and coming to the end of their pre-school days. We will use the longitudinal information available from multiple data collection points to describe their early growth and developmental trajectories and to describe the individual, familial and broader environmental characteristics that are associated with differential patterns of early development for contemporary NZ children - including anthropometry (NZ rates of childhood obesity are amongst the worst in the OECD), child behaviour (SDQ has been measured at 2 and 4 years), and cognition.", "At a cross-sectional level we see many disparities in outcomes within the NZ child population with Maori and Pacific children being much more likely to be doing less well than their NZ European peers across many key developmental domains. The longitudinal view will provide us with new ways to understand the origins of these early life disparities that often translate into lifelong burdens in terms of well-being, educational outcomes and broader engagement in society. The longitudinal analyses will provide a much fuller understanding of \u201cwhat works\u2019 in terms of early life environments that lead to resilience in the face of early life disadvantage.

The key findings of that report suggest that moving house is a frequent event in the lives of young New Zealand families and the level of residential mobility is greater than that demonstrated in other comparable cohorts such as that of the Millennium Cohort in the UK. Notably between birth and two years of age, 45.3% of children had moved at least once, and 38% had moved twice or more.", "The key determinant of residential mobility was housing tenure. Families living in private rental accommodation were the most likely to move followed by those living in public rentals and those in their own homes. Approximately two thirds of families moving from a private rental house were moving to another private rental house.", "The degree of residential mobility of young families has important implications for the planning of and the location and provision of services that young families interact, importantly those relating to health and education.

A key aim of the study is to use the evidence from analyses to inform context-relevant strategies to reduce inequalities from early life. In particular, we focussed on the differences by ethnicity in exposure to persistent poverty over the first 1000 days of life, as well as how these contribute to early gaps in serious childhood illnesses, abnormal child behaviour, obesity and readiness for school.", "The findings from the Growing Up in New Zealand study demonstrate that Maori and Pasifika children experience the highest burden of socioeconomic disadvantage in their early years as well as an unequal burden of significant co-morbidities in terms of health and development throughout their life course.

Risk factors for early vulnerability cluster and there is no one single proxy marker of disadvantage. Additionally, morbidity and poor outcomes cluster. Persistent adversity is associated with a graded likelihood of poor outcomes (across the population). Further service use is not meeting measured need. Currently, access to early life universal services may be widening inequalities. A proportional-universalism approach to services is required if they are to meet real need and reduce inequalities.", "The findings on resilience in the preschool years from the Growing Up in New Zealand study have been used to inform the co-design of a significant community based strategy to tackle inequalities in one of the most deprived communities in New Zealand. Strengths-based approaches such as these are particularly relevant to the New Zealand government\u2019s bold new cross-sectoral wellbeing strategy.", "Through this research, we have found that to effectively influence and inform policy, research evidence needs to go beyond looking only at risk factors and also take into account an understanding of what shapes resilience among communities, diverse families and for individuals over time. Partnerships between researchers and policymakers create opportunities to facilitate robust scientific research with capacity to provide policy relevant outputs.
