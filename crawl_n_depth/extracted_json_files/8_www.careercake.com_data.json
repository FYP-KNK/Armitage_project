Hi!", "Bethan:", " Hi!", "Aimee:", " It\u2019s really good to catch up with Bethan. Now we're going to be talking about something that our Careercake community talk to us about a lot. And that's imposter syndrome. They don't always use the terminology imposter syndrome. They talk to us about their fears and the issues that they're facing. They don't necessarily use that term. But it's usually stuff like, \u201cI don't feel good enough\u201d, \u201cI feel like a fraud\u201d, \u201cI feel like somebody is going to tap me on the shoulder and be like, \u2018Oh yeah, game over. You're not really that smart\u2019\u201d that kind of stuff. I get imposter syndrome all the time too, and all of my friends and all the other people I work with. So, I wanted to talk to you - what is imposter syndrome? Shall we start there?", "Bethan:", " Well, you\u2019re spot on. It is about that constant fear that you're not good enough. So it's often a constant state of like low laying anxiety of that feeling like you're going to be found out; that you\u2019re a fraud, that you\u2019re never achieving what you need to achieve in some way.", "Aimee:", " And it's exhausting. It is so exhausting. So what type of people would you say - because a lot of the time we think that it's just us isn't it? Nobody else feels like this - but what type of people would feel and suffer from imposter syndrome?", "Bethan:", " The research shows that at least 70% of people experience it.\u00a0", "Aimee:", " No way. It's got to be more.", "Bethan:", " But that's the thing, because I think when people talk about how they are in life and in work, most of the time this comes up in some area of not feeling good enough. So, imposter syndrome, people often talk about it in work, but it can be at home. It can be in any area of your life. That feeling that you are not clever enough, not smart enough, not experienced enough. Whatever that is and so that can come up for anybody.", "Aimee:", " And where does it come from? Does it only happen when you're doing something you haven't done before? Does it only happen when you're doing something you really care about?", "Bethan:", " That's often when it's loudest. So, if you think about when you're being brave, when you first enter your new role or you're doing something that you haven't got very much experience in and that is often when it can come up. But it can just be underneath the whole time. So it's not specific and it can be in certain circumstances when perhaps you don't know people, that can also come up as well.", "Aimee:", " The fear of judgment and people finding out can be the thing that holds people back the most. And it's like, get out of your own way. If I could just deal with this imposter syndrome, I could achieve this, I could do that. And it's like that little constant monkey on your shoulder.", "Bethan:", " We talk about your inner critic, your gremlin or it\u2019s that voice in your head. And we all have voices in our head. And I mean it sounds crazy but we do. And it's that constant negative self-talk that says you should be doing this better. It's the internal judgment of - what would that person think of me?", "Aimee:", " So you're hearing about imposter syndrome, lots of people are talking about it which is a really positive thing, but why is it such a good thing for us to introduce to people in the workplace within their first decade? Why do people need to be aware that this is a thing? This is an absolute thing. That is a fact. This is happening to people.", "Bethan:", " Because if you know about it, you can talk about it and talking about it is the first step to overcoming it. And actually, in the act of talking about it, then you can find different strategies that work for you.", "Aimee:", " In what situations can it hold you back?", "----- Subscribe to watch this interview in full.\u00a0", "Expert", "Bethan\u00a0works with individuals and organisations who want to become braver and support their people to take more smart risks.", "\n\t\tPower Up\t", "\n\t\t", "\n\t", "\n", "\n\t\tPower Up\t", "\n\t\t", "\n\t", "\n", "\n\t\tPower Up\t", "\n\t\t", "\n\t", "\n", "\n            \n            \u00a9 Copyright 2020 Careercake Limited |\n            Registered in England & Wales No: 09715695 |\n            ", "Privacy & Cookie Policy", " |\n            ", "Terms of Use", "\n          ", "With Alex Moyle", "\n\t\tElevate\t", "\n\t\t", "\n\t", "\n", "Get unlimited access wherever you are; 24/7", "Custom learning paths tailored to you", "Delivered by leading experts", "Running effective 1-2-1 meetings with your staff can be daunting.

So, we're going to talk about something that our viewers come to us a lot with this challenge. So, you know, it's the first decade of their career and they're doing a really, really good job. And then they get promoted and now they're a manager.", "Mark:", " Wonderful and scary", "Aimee:", " All at the same time.\u00a0", "Aimee:", " I remember my first management job; I was 25, managing a team of people that were all older than me, more experienced than me, better than me; that's what I kept telling myself. So how do we deal with that? All of the challenges. We sometimes call them accidental managers. So, can we talk about that? What is an accidental manager?", "Mark:", " I guess you get to that point within your career where you're recognised as being good at whatever job you were in prior to becoming a manager. I think what most businesses see when they promote someone is, they see their skill base in their previous role and there's lots of common misconceptions in the world that \u201cOh, you were good at that, therefore you must be good at this\u201d. And it's a different skillset from being an expert or just being very good at job A to job B, which requires leadership skills and management skills. So, lots of businesses promote people based on an idea that they're very good at these things. It puts a lot of people in awkward positions because obviously, people want to be promoted, they want to progress their careers, they want to develop, [and] they are sometimes left in a position where they are in a job that they're not quite yet ready for \u2026", "Aimee:", " \u2026 and comfortable with.", "Mark:", " Absolutely, and that doesn't mean that they are doomed to fail, by any stretch of the imagination, but it does mean that they need to recognise that they are starting from a place where they've still got a lot to learn.", "Aimee:", " And they are going to be uncomfortable, so embrace that. Especially if you've just been made a manager, like you said, it's because you've been doing really well in your job. You\u2019re used to being top dog - \u201cYeah, look at me doing really well\u201d. Feeling, and quite rightly so, that you're pretty awesome. And then you go and do something that's completely out of your comfort zone, and that itself has an impact on somebody doesn\u2019t it, that switch?", "Mark:", " You go from up here, to down here, because you are excelling in your current role to learning something, if not completely new, quite new. Certainly, the new skill base is a different area of expertise. So, [from] something that you've become very comfortable in to being very uncomfortable in. It's a real change in skill base. I think if individuals recognise entirely that everyone has to start somewhere, that most people are not recruited into a job like that because they are deemed to be the finished article, but someone who has the skills to start, but is probably more of a blank canvas that could be moulded - that can be developed to be the type of person that they need in that position. If people recognise that, as well as recognise that everyone's going to fail at some things and that it's safe to do so in most environments.", "Aimee:", " That\u2019s key for so many things, isn't it?", "Mark:", "\u00a0 It is. People have got to feel comfortable knowing where their limitations are, so they can put plans in place to develop themselves. And not enough people do that and that's where people become unstuck. I think the people who will typically fail when they go into a leadership role for the first time are either those that don't really recognise their own limitations - I wouldn't use the word arrogance, but they overly assume that they're going to be great at it, that there's not going to be any issues. People like that typically fail because they haven't asked for help or they haven't recognised the areas that they need to develop or they've set themselves up to fail by not recognising that it's going to be difficult and that most people absolutely don't start off in a place where they're going to excel in that leadership role straightaway.", "Aimee:", " What about you? What was your first management job like?", "Mark:", "\u00a0 My first management role was particularly difficult. I was particularly young. I think I was 23 when I first started. I\u2019ve been doing HR forever. So, I was young when I went into my first HR leadership position and it was difficult because the business circumstances were difficult. I wasn't in a situation where I could overthink my role as a manager\u00a0", "Aimee:", " and what do you mean by difficult?", "Mark:", " It was just a business that was undergoing significant change.", "Aimee:", " So the culture, people's moods, were a little bit \u2026", "Mark:", " Yes, it was quite unstable. There was a lot happening in the global economy at the time, so we had to pull people together. It was an all hands-on deck situation and that was it. I think I succeeded and have gone on from there because of the level of resilience I showed early on. Touch wood, things will probably never be that difficult again. I think what I learned from my very first management job was that I didn't have time to pretend to be an excellent manager. I absolutely needed to recognise that I was going to be okay at it. That, you know, I wasn't going to be perfect at everything, but I was going to learn and also just entirely recognise that those that were working for knew that I wasn't some sort of God - that I was going to come in and be amazing - was fallible like everyone else. That I wasn't the finished article and that they were going to help me learn as much as I was going to help them through leading them.", "Aimee:", " A lot of people, \u2026, like you for example, did you work with them before you became [their manager]?", "Mark:", " I did, yeah.", "Aimee:", " Okay, so it's the whole \u2013 you\u2019re mates with them on the Friday, might even have been down the pub having beers with them, and then Monday comes, and I know a lot of our viewers, a lot of our audience come back and say \u201cI'm a new manager. How on earth do I talk to them? Because they were my mates last week\u201d. And they are still your mates, but how do you deal with the fact that you are their line manager now?", "Mark:", " I think a lot of that is to do with psychological barriers. We have to recognise now that we're in a different position and therefore there is this different psychological barrier between a manager and a person who works for them. That does exist. There's no two ways about it. You know that person has elevated to another position with a different set of accountabilities and responsibilities, so they are in a different role. There is a difference.", "Aimee:", " So firstly, accept that. When you're thinking, \u201coh no I haven't changed. I'm still me.\u201d You are still you, but recognise ...", "Mark:", " Recognise that that difference exists. But I also think it's about doing so in the context of what's changing. There's this misconception that you have to become this different person - manager Mark is different to non-manager Mark. Well, actually, I'm 99% the same person. I now have to do different things and act in a slightly different way. I think if you pretend to be someone else, then people will absolutely see through that and it makes the job more difficult. So, I think remaining authentic and staying who you are is really important, because actually, who you are is the reason why you've just been promoted, because they recognise the skills. I think you have to recognise that you're in a different position and that there is a barrier that's now being created or rather a change in dynamic. But also, don't take it too seriously. And don't forget who you are, because who you are is why you\u2019ve got to where you've got to.", "Aimee:", " Is there a real life example you could provide of what does change and what has to stay the same? So when you say authentic, does that mean that you can go to your team and say \u201cI'm really stressed today at how to do this\u201d which is what you might have done week ago when they were your peers?", "Mark:", " I think it is difficult. I think there are absolutely some things now that it's probably best to confide in your line managers than those that report to you. They need to have confidence that you know what you're doing. You\u2019ll get that leeway first of all when you\u2019re first in that job because people recognise that as your first job. There is a level of changing who you would confide in about self-development at work and that sort of thing. I think you would go to your line manager instead of discussing that with the people who report to you. But having said that, they are people who will know where your areas of development are. They would have worked with you and now they work for you and they'll know where you need to develop and where you need to improve. So, it's not going to be a completely new concept to them that there are areas to develop. But some of the big issues that I've experienced certainly at one point in time, I was providing an HR management service to an engineering workshop. I remember one of the managers saying \u201cYou know, I used to go every Friday for drinks after work, I can't do that anymore. I'm not allowed to do that. Now I'm the manager, you know, just in case.\u201d And I just remember saying, \u201cWell why, why can't you?\u201d You're still their friend it\u2019s just that you're held to a different standard now. Things you may have turned a blind eye to before you; you can't anymore. But it doesn't mean that you've become this different person and that you need to exclude yourself and create these gaping big barriers. Just recognise that there's a slight barrier and that you need to manage that in the best way you can.", "Aimee:", " So maybe go out for those drinks, but it depends on, I suppose, how big those drinks get \u2013 you end up clubbing at two in the morning - so are you going out for these drinks? Maybe, but if you know it's going to get a little bit cray, then you might just go home even if you want to stay and have loads of fun. Because you have to, I suppose, keep making sure that you create, or you have boundaries where you can still be there for them, but then know that if you need to have a difficult conversation, at any point that there's going to be a level of respect there. That respect is a two way thing.", "Mark:", " Absolutely, they're going to hold you to a different standard as well as you holding yourself to that different standard. So, it does help to maintain a good level of professionalism. You can remain professional whilst still remaining friendly, relatable. These are people you may have something in common with and you can still talk to John every Thursday like you normally do, about what happened on the game on the weekend. You know that you haven't become a different person. It is about knowing when you want to \u2018de-expose\u2019 yourself from these situations.", "Aimee:", " But still enjoy those wonderful relationships that you\u2019ve built.", "Mark:", " Definitely, yeah.", "Aimee:", " What if you're going into a job, [in] a new organisation, you haven't worked with them before and you are becoming more senior to people that might have actually applied for that job or they might be older than you. This this something that a lot of our Careercake community ask about. They\u2019re now in a position where they're managing people that are older than them. 90% of the time, if not more, these people don\u2019t have an issue with that at all. But in your head, you think it's going to be an issue. What advice would you give to a new manager that's going in fresh?", "Mark:", "\u00a0I've been in that exact same situation. When you started your management career, as young as I was when I started, nearly everyone who reported to me was always older than me, and it was an issue early on, [but] only ever an issue to me. It was only ever something that, in my mind, I thought was going to be a problem. And you know what? It never ever was. It never resulted in anyone saying, yeah, but he's only 20 something. It just never actually turned into anything. So, the way I get past it now, there's no scientific method or anything is that, \u201cWell it's never happened before so it's probably never going to happen at all\u201d. I just think it's just recognising that, you know, it's an old fashioned concern that doesn't really happen in most modern workplaces. The world has moved on. When you're new to an organisation in a more senior role \u2013 it was interesting you asked about actually going into a role that people you're working with may have applied for and not being successful in. I get that that is a difficult situation and you are quite often on trial by the people who didn't get the job because they want to know why you've had it and they didn't. What have you got that they haven't? I think the only way that you can combat that, really, is to not change. It\u2019s to act exactly the way you were going to act. Irrespective of that, that's a nuance that doesn't really need to be considered as a way of over emphasising or over egging the pudding in terms of how you're going to apply yourself and work with that person.", "Aimee:", " Would you ever have a conversation with that person [about it]?", "Mark:", " Only if it ever became an issue. Only if it was something that person had said, that person may approach the subject in a very professional way and say to you, \u201cLook, you know, just to let you know, I applied for that job and I didn't get it. It's a bit raw with me at the moment\u201d and you may say, \u201cWell look, I appreciate you coming to me and discussing\u201d And you just acknowledge it. \u201cThank you. Look. It's not going to be a problem. Look, it is me that was chosen, but what I can do is I can work with you to give you the skills to help you, if this opportunity comes up in future so that you'd be a stronger candidate.\u201d That's one great way of dealing with that situation. But you also get the others who may not ever be fully on board because \u201cYou've just waltzed in here and had my job\u201d, and all this sort of thing. And again, if that was a problem or it did manifest itself in a bigger problem, I would absolutely call it out. And I would speak to that person and say \u201cLook, you know, I understand that it's an issue for you. It is what it is, and we now need to find a way of working together successfully\u201d. That person may be really valued at what they do. I think it's about recognising that and saying \u201cYou're an integral member of my team, but this is an unfortunate situation. We need to get past that\u201d and ask them \u201cWhat can we do to move beyond this?\u201d", "Aimee:", " That\u2019s great advice - Call it out. Don't hide from it and have that conversation. So, our viewers might be getting a new job as a manager and they might be feeling like a little bit of a fraudster. Like, \u201cI don't know how I got here. Am I good enough for this?\u201d Especially when you\u2019re going through the day, where you're being challenged and you feel like you're a bit of a failure, you go to bed at night, and you know deep down that that's part of the growth process. That's how you get better at stuff. But it's still feeling like they going to find out are and they are going to tell me that they made a mistake. So, talk about that.", "Mark:", " We used to call it self-doubt. That\u2019s all it used to be - I'm suffering with a bit of self-doubt or crisis of confidence and all this sort of thing. These days it\u2019s more recognised or, or more defined by people generally as something called imposter syndrome. Imposter syndrome is where people do feel like a fraud at work. They feel that they are absolutely going to be found out at some point in time because they don't really believe, or they don't feel that they should be in the position that they're in, that they're very fortunate to be there and that there's someone else who's more qualified to do the job. That feeling of imposter syndrome is quite often baseless or it\u2019s just human nature to feel that way.\u00a0", "Aimee:", " Is it human nature for everyone or is it just certain types of people?", "Mark:", " Most people, I would say. Imposter syndrome, generally, is talked about a lot at the moment. It's very popular as a term at the moment because now people have a term to refer to. So politicians are speaking a lot about imposter syndrome. Sports people are talking a lot. Celebrities and business people - imposter syndrome is very popular. In its early days, studies into imposter syndrome showed that it was more prevalent in women than men, but in more recent studies it's becoming that men and women both suffer with imposter syndrome. But in the early studies it was identified more as something that affected females.", "Aimee:", " I\u2019d heard that and certainly back in my career when it started 15 years ago that if you ever wanted to talk about some of this, it was always female facilitators. It was something that, you know, and it's like absolutely not [just women].", "Mark:", " No, not anymore. No. I suffer with imposter syndrome frequently. (", "Aimee:", " That was going to be my next question). Yeah, I do. (", "Aimee:", " Cos you\u2019re awesome) (", "Mark:", " Thank you very much) (", "Aimee:", " And you feel like that at times?)", "Mark:", " In the car on the way here this morning - \u201cWhy am I being interviewed?\u201d I think the way in which I overcome imposter syndrome, when I do get it, is, I've been asked to do this because of something; because of other things that I do or other things that I've said or my professional credentials or whatever it may be. I think it is just a way of dealing with impostor syndrome is recognising why you're in that position in the first place. So, if someone is suffering with imposter syndrome, when they are first appointed into a new role, it's worth than just recognising that someone saw something in them to give them that new job", "Aimee:", " You didn\u2019t win a raffle.", "Mark:", " No, exactly. You've earned that opportunity to get there. And because you've earned that opportunity to get there, then you are not an imposter. I think the next thing is just recognising, that the people who chose me to be here also know that I'm not the finished article and they'll know that there are areas for me to develop. So when imposter syndrome is constant or when it affects people to the extent that they're constantly thinking about it, what I would try and do is look at the root cause I would absolutely try and drill into the particular issue, that I think I'm an imposter because - so I guess it might be -\u00a0 I'm feeling this way every time I need to do this or I feel this way every time I'm invited to a meeting or I feel this way every time I need to go on a course or something like that. Because if you can do that, it's kind of like diagnosing the cause. If I'm feeling this way, when that happens, why is that? And sometimes it's worth recognising in a one to one with a manager or in a performance review saying \u201cI keep having this. Why do you think that is? Is that something you recognise in me? Is there a way in which we can try and overcome that?\u201d and sometimes it's absolutely a conversation that someone can have with their manager, where they've got that relationship to have it with them.", "Aimee:", " I'm going to press you on that, and I totally agree with you, but I know that I've had this in the past. I know some people would say that \u201cThey've just promoted me. So, they're the last person that I want to think that I can't do that.\u201d What would you say [to that]?", "Mark: I would say they probably haven't promoted you thinking that you're the finished article. They've promoted you knowing that you have a core set of skills and you have a range of different expertise and you bring something to the party that no one else that they interviewed, brought to the party. They have faith and they have confidence in you. That doesn't mean they think you're the finished article.", "Aimee:", " No one is.", "Mark:", " Exactly. So I think going to them to say, \u201cLook, I'm doing well in these areas. My team morale is great.\u00a0 I've got people doing exactly what they need to do. This resulted in this, but I've got this niggling doubt and I need to do something about this or I keep thinking about this. Is there a better way that I can approach it?\u201d And I think managers more often than not, certainly the ones I speak to, when they are dealing with ultimate failure, which is, you know, someone who is really underperforming in their job, more often than not, the manager will say to me, \u201cIf only they'd come to me and asked for help\u201d.", "Aimee:", " I would have loved that. Yeah, I would have loved it if they'd come and asked. That's the attitude that you're looking for, isn't it? That person that wants to be a sponge, wants to learn, wants to progress.", "Mark:", " But people often either don't do it or they do it too late. And I think if there is a learning need, it's absolutely worth exploring that with the line manager because, just because you're recognising one learning need, doesn't mean you're very poor at everything else.", "Aimee:", " As a new manager, how important is it, and are you able to spot imposter syndrome in your team and the people that you're leading?", "Mark:", " It is very difficult to spot imposter syndrome in others because imposter syndrome is, is a way that someone feels. And it's very easy to hide. You just bury it deep down and focus on other things and just do stuff.", "Aimee:", " And that's why you\u2019re so surprised isn\u2019t it? When people like you \u2026 I know there was a CEO of an amazing organisation that I was lucky enough to be asked to go to the AGM, and the CEO, employs 3000 people and she has one opportunity to talk to people. But she used her 30 minutes to talk about the fact that she's crippled by imposter syndrome.", "Mark:", " I think it's very difficult to spot, but a great way of coming at it from a different angle is by, as a manager, making that environment at work a place where people can feel as if they can come forward to you. So, if you can't identify it in others or if you have a feeling that someone may be feeling that way, but you can't quite pin anything on it, one of the best things a manager can do, not just for imposter syndrome, but anyway, to create maximum productivity in their team, is just by making that environment a safe and healthy place for them to work, and to work on that relationship with the people who work with them, for them, where they can make their team members feel able to come and speak to them about anything. And if you've built up that level of trust, if you've built up that level of respect, then when people have those conversations with you, imposter syndrome may be one of those subjects that they talk about. I think that's a really healthy way of forging good working relationships with the people around you. I think gone are the days where people would just see managers as god-like figures and people see employees as machines that don't have emotions, in most businesses. I think people connect now on a much more human level and humans absolutely have areas where they need to develop and need reassurance and need to feel valued and need to feel like they've got a place to work where they can talk about stuff that they need to talk about that.", "Aimee:", " Absolutely. So, you talked a little bit there about trust. How important is trust and building trust? How'd you do that with your new team?", "Mark:", " It's really, really important because if you can't build trust with your team, then they're not going to come to you and they're not going to give you their best selves basically. And you're not going to be able to perform in your role as best you can if your team are distrusting of you. But there's a big difference between being distrusted and being trusted. The best way of building trust with your team is genuinely by being a trustworthy individual, it\u2019s by following up on your actions. It's by listening to people. It is about listening to any concerns that they have and trying to support them and help them with it.", "Aimee:", " So, if you say you're going to do something, do it. Don't over promise when you might not have the authority to approve certain things.", "Mark:", " It's about recognising that people in your teams will need help, will need assistance and that you're there to support them. You're not there to catch them out doing something wrong because some times, a distrusting individual will think that the reason something's being done is because \u201cThey're trying to catch me out\u201d. I'm here to help you and support you because working together, we're going to give this organisation the best chance of success at whatever the organisation does.", "Aimee:", " What part does vulnerability play in that? I suppose you're saying that it's difficult to spot imposter syndrome in the people that work with you. So foster an environment where they feel they can talk to you if they're struggling and be vulnerable. I suppose you really need to trust somebody, your manager, in order to go to them and say, \u201cI'm struggling or I'm feeling like I'm not the best person for this. Are you sure I should be doing, you know, all of that stuff?\u201d So how important is it for you to show your own vulnerability with your team and what, what would that balance even look like?", "Mark:", " I think that's a very personal scale. I would say for individuals. Is it important to show your vulnerability? Probably, in the right context, at the right time. Maybe not for everyone. I think what's really key is just making sure that people recognise that I'm human, you're human and together we are trying to do something as humans. I know that sounds pink and fluffy, but ultimately, people need to relate to you. They may relate to you because you're just as vulnerable as they are. They may relate to you because you just as confident as they are. There may be a number of different ways. I think some of the best managers that I've worked for have been people that I've related to and they've known how to work with me, and I've known how to work with them. If you can build that relationship, demonstrating where you may have come across similar situations to what they've experienced before, that you may have felt the way that they feel right now, maybe you still feel that way, then you\u2019re creating that relationship by demonstrating that actually we've got stuff in common and it's easier to manage people who are able to relate. They don't need necessarily need to have things in common with you. The worst thing in the world that you want, as a manager, is to have a team of people that are all identical. You will lack and lose diversity of thought, but you want to be able to have a good solid working relationship with them and there is going to be common ground there and vulnerability can be one of those areas of common ground.", "Aimee:", " If you could give 23 year old Mark Hendy, that just got his first management job in an environment that wasn't that cushty, what advice would you give yourself?", "Mark:", " Don't buy that car that I bought when I was 23! I would probably give myself the advice of not taking myself so seriously. I think I fell into the trap in my first management role of thinking I needed to be someone else and thinking that I couldn't have a laugh and a joke anymore. And I became quite miserable, really. And I thought this isn't me anymore. So, I very quickly reverted back to previous Mark. But I took on board the management skills that I knew I needed to be effective in that job. So, I think it's just absolutely don't take yourself too seriously. Don't think you have to be a different person. Recognise your strengths. Recognise the weaknesses and the areas for development. Do something about it. And that's probably about it.", "Aimee:", " And don't buy that car!", "Mark:", " That Polo was a mistake.", "Aimee:", " Thank you so much for sharing in such an authentic way.", "\u00a0", "\u00a0", "Expert", "Mark Hendy is an HR professional from south Wales who has worked in various sectors across some of the UK\u2019s biggest businesses, operating both nationally and internationally.", "\n\t\tPower Up\t", "\n\t\t", "\n\t", "\n", "\n\t\tPower Up\t", "\n\t\t", "\n\t", "\n", "\n\t\tPower Up\t", "\n\t\t", "\n\t", "\n", "\n            \n            \u00a9 Copyright 2020 Careercake Limited |\n            Registered in England & Wales No: 09715695 |\n            ", "Privacy & Cookie Policy", " |\n            ", "Terms of Use", "\n          ", "With Rachel Anderson", "\n\t\tRadiate\t", "\n\t\t", "\n\t", "\n", "Get unlimited access wherever you are; 24/7", "Custom learning paths tailored to you", "Delivered by leading experts", "Do you identify as introverted?

In fact for over 40 years I struggled with feeling like I wasn\u2019t enough; that I should be a different version of me - one that was a strong action taker, decisive, energetic, larger than life, dynamic, quick on the uptake, fun to be around, always clear, good at networking and putting myself \u2018out there\u2019.", "Ugh, how exhausting!

In fact, I managed to burn myself out trying to be a perfect extrovert, pretending to be someone other than my natural self.", "Since then I\u2019ve come to realise and accept my true, introverted nature, and understood there was no shame in just being \u2018me\u2019, comfortable in my own skin - ahh, such liberation!

NO, of course not, but it is true that I have never been more successful in all areas of my life as I am right now, since I learned how to embrace the natural me, and fully harness my strengths as an introvert.

Jacqui\u2019s personal experiences add integrity to the presentation, and illustrate the importance of authenticity in the workplace and the wider world. Issues are raised frankly and clearly, helping me to have a better understanding of how to be an ally. I hadn\u2019t fully appreciated the difficult journey that someone can have when they come out at work. Thank you Jacqui for raising the issues and helping me reflect on what I can do to be more inclusive and supportive. ", "Highly recommend. As an ally, I found this course very useful with some great practical advice and guidance to better support my LGBT+ colleagues and friends. Jacqui has an engaging and friendly style that makes the content enjoyable to listen to, and the honest and personal experiences brings the story to life. After finishing this course I feel inspired to do more \u2013 thank you!", "A great course, very clearly presented in bite size chunks and offering valuable advice to anyone considering coming out, or who wants to be an important straight ally to their follow LGBT+ colleagues and friends.  As someone who is now out at work, I can very clearly relate to Jacqui\u2019s thoughts and statistics around productivity, \u2018hiding/covering\u2019 and avoiding conversations with people.  It is exhausting and thankfully avoidable. It so true that you can achieve extraordinary things once you are comfortable in being your authentic and true self in the workplace.  It is not the easiest of steps to take, but small steps can lead to the most liberating and rewarding experiences in the long term. Thanks Jacqui!", "Wow! This course definitely has something for everyone, whether straight or LGBT+. Jacqui's personal stories really helped bring home how important is it to be \"out\", and how necessary it is to build an inclusive environment, both inside and outside of work. The course also has practical tips on what you can do as an ally. But what was especially helpful was how to turn a potentially negative comment/discussion around so you're in control of it. As someone who is comfortable being out at work, I still learnt a lot from this video. Thank you so much!", "I found this incredibly informative. The course is presented in a really friendly and accessible way and I enjoyed listening to Jacqui's experience. Having watched this, I feel inspired to do more in my workplace and would encourage anyone, regardless of their sexuality or gender identity to watch this, as there are some key takeaways and lots of useful points to share from this course.", "Brilliant course. This has some great content, presented in a very easy, quick and digestible way.  Under 20 minutes to do the whole course, or can come back and do this in chapters.

Watch this video to learn about Careercake's top 10 rules of telephone etiquette. We'll cover how to be confident and how to prepare as well as things like how to act if the call has been transferred to you by mistake.\u00a0", "Hi, my name is Aimee Bateman, career coach and founder of Careercake.", "In this video we're going to look at the ", "10 rules of telephone etiquette", " because so much attention is placed on online communications - so emails, LinkedIn messages, tweets, social media - that the skill of actually influencing or even just talking on the phone is a bit of a lost art. But answering the phone even if you hate it, which I know a lot of people do and phone etiquette are still have really big part of the experience that you give your customers, the experience you give you clients, your suppliers, your colleagues. So here are my thoughts and my tips for keeping it sweet.", "So my first tip is to ", "take notes", ". So make sure that you've got a pen and some paper, maybe an iPad, a notepad. You are at your desk so it's likely that you've got one there. What you don't want to do is have to put somebody on hold or delay the call while you go and find a pen or while you go to find some paper.", "Number two, ", "introduce yourself", "; now this is a bit of an obvious one but it\u2019s worth mentioning because you should really introduce yourself at the beginning of the call; the first thing that you say, and then you can start building rapport.", "Number three, ", "pick a positive tone", ". Now your tone of voice is so important and I said pick a positive tone because how you deliver your tone, how you feel, is your choice. You have a choice to be positive. You have a choice to be negative. And when you don't have that body language to influence the situation, you know most of what we communicate is not verbally, it's through our body language, but you're on the phone so there isn't any body language. So you'll need to make up for that feeling, the feeling that you're giving off by your tone of voice. Your tone is so important. So, make sure it's upbeat. Make sure it's really positive and even if you've been answering the phone for 10 years and work, especially if you've been answering the phone at work for 10 years because it's easy to forget. Remember that your tone of voice can affect and impact the person on the other end. So just take a moment, literally just one, two seconds, pause, smile, and then pick positive.", "The fourth point - ", "slow it down", ". So if you're rushed like, [speaks quickly] \u201cHi, Careercake, Aimee speaking\u201d \u00a0- that was really rubbish acting! - but if you're really rushed, it may make the person feel like you can't really be bothered to talk to them or you're really busy and in fact they were interrupting you. And again, there\u2019s no body language so they can't see your lips, they can't see the words being created. And sometimes when we're looking at somebody and they're talking quite quickly, that's how we help and understand what it is that they're saying. This is really hard for me because I'm Welsh and not all, but most Welsh people tend to talk really quickly. So this is something that I've had to constantly remember to do, especially when I'm filming. But more importantly, when I'm on the phone, I want to make everyone feel like they understand me. I don't want anybody feeling frustrated that they didn't fully catch what I was saying. And also by taking the time and not rushing, it makes that person feel like you're not rushing them. They matter to you. You've got the time to give them.", "So ", "what to do if the phone call isn't for you", ". So they've called and it's not your department even. Definitely not for you. You don't want to firstly make them feel like they've made a mistake and blame them and be like, \u201cOh well I'm sorry, but you want the highways department, you've got the wrong number.\u201d It's not their fault that they've got the wrong number. You want to say that it's okay that they've got the wrong number. Help them. Don\u2019t just leave them to it \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019ve got the wrong number, off you go - you've probably had calls like that before. I have and I just think \u201cCheers. That's the number that was on the website. Thanks for helping me or not helping me\u201d. Tell them it's okay. Totally fine \u2013 \u201cI can help you.\u201d It doesn't matter how busy you are - \u201cI can help you. That's fine\u201d. Transfer them, put them on hold, find the number for them. What you want to do is when they do get transferred to the next department, you want that person to say, \u201cOh, this really super cool person in X department just now helped me. They were really nice\u201d. You don't want them to say, \u201cOh finally spoken to who I want to speak to. I spoke to a really rude colleague of yours.\u201d You don't want to be that person ever. But I do want to say this, just before you put them on hold or just before you transfer them, ask them if it's okay. Tell them that that's what you're going to do. Don't just go quiet on them. I've been on the phone before, it's just gone dead and I'm like, \u201cHello, is anyone there?\u201d and they've just transferred me. But they haven't told me that that's what they were doing and it just feels a little bit off. So, tell them \u201cIt's okay\u201d. Help them. Ask their permission before you transfer the call and just really nice little touch. Give them the number. So even if you transfer them, give them the number just in case they get cut off, or just in case they need to have a direct number in the future, because if you transfer them, they might not still have the right number. So always do that as well.", "So telephone etiquette, number six, the sixth rule. What if you\u2019re just really busy, like genuinely really busy and you don't have the time for the call? Well, if it's your boss or if it's a really pressing issue, then you probably need to find the time, but if not, it's not your boss and ", "it's not a really pressing issue, then you can just bat it away", ". You can bat it away. But do it like this - So if Janet in Finance has called \u2013 \u201cAre you really busy?\u201d Don't just go \u201cJanet, sorry, I'm going to stop you there. I'm really busy.\u201d because that can be a little bit dismissive, a little bit rude. Just give her a moment to just explain herself and what's going on. Don't interrupt her, let her finish her bit and then say with that smile on your face, with that positivity, \u201cThank you for calling. Really, really want to help you with that. I genuinely do. I do have something that needs my attention right now.\u201d Tell her that it's really important, but you have something that really needs to happen right now and that you'll call her back or you're looking into it or \u201cCan I give you a ring back?\u201d and then whatever time you say you're going to give her a ring back, make sure you give her a ring back. So always do what you say you're going to do and that's an absolutely fine way to handle that situation.", "Number seven is ", "don't allow any interruptions", ". Do not let yourself be distracted by any conversations or people around you. The person on the phone right now is your priority. Definitely a priority of anybody that comes into the office or any hand signals that your colleagues are doing or all of your emails coming in. You might be on the phone and reading emails, so don\u2019t do that. I have a really busy office. I have my colleague Ellen, I've got my colleague Alison next to me. There's a lot of us in quite a small office. There's always stuff going on and I'll just turn my chair. So I\u2019ll turn my chair and I'll just face the wall sometimes when I'm having a telephone conversation, then there's no distractions. Because what you want is that person to be, in that moment, it.", "So rule number eight, ", "check your voicemail", ". If you do have that voicemail functionality, check it at least once a day. It's really frustrating for colleagues if you're trying to get hold of somebody. It's happened to me before trying to get hold of a colleague because there's a project that you're working on, you really need their input but they never get back to you. The reason they don't get back to you is because they didn't know you called because they never check their voicemail. So check it. That's what it's there for. I would say that people will appreciate you getting back to them really quickly so if you could check it more than once a day, that'd be great. But if you're really, really busy - you know, head down - once a day is okay. I do want to say this though - don't be that person who permanently has their voicemail on. It's almost like the default - voicemail on; don't want to talk to anyone. The reason being is that it can be really frustrating. You're not building relationships with colleagues, it\u2019s a big barrier to everybody in the organisation and whether you like it or not, no matter how busy you are, communicating with your colleagues, helping each other is part of the game. It's part of the processes. The reason why businesses and organisations are successful. So even if you're tempted to just put your voicemail on because you\u2019ve got a lot to do that day. Don't. Think, \u201cCan I just maybe put it on for an hour? Maybe just the morning.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Don't have it on default. Don\u2019t be that person.", "So rule number nine, ", "leaving voice messages", ". Just take all of the positive, all of the good stuff from this video and apply it here. So even though you're not talking to a person, they're still a person that's going to be listening back. And we've all listened to audio books or podcasts where the content's really good, but the person just sounds really miserable. So you want to smile, you want to be really positive and you want to be clear. So you might want to leave your phone number - do it twice, leave your phone number, then repeat your phone number so they've got chance to double check it. And if you're not so used to telephone conversations and you're more used to online - LinkedIn messages, emails - and you're not used to listening to the sound of your voice, it's okay to just record yourself because you might think that you'd be really clear. You might think that you\u2019re sounding really positive, but when you listen to it again - maybe not so much. So it's always worth just practicing recording and listening back because that's what the other person's going to hear.", "Finally, rule number 10 ", "ending the call with impact", ". One of the sayings I love is \u201cPeople forget what you said. They will forget what you did, but they will never forget the way you made them feel.\u201d And this is so important and very true when it comes to phone calls. So, you want them to leave this phone call feeling really positive about that touchpoint with you. So what you want to do is just thank them for calling, ask them is there anything else I can help you with and then compliment them \u2013 \u201cYou're doing some really good stuff over in finance. I'm really glad I was able to add value in some way. If there's anything I can do in future, you just let me know.\u201d Make them feel really good about themselves and glad that they picked up the phone and spoke to you.", "One of the things that I think is important to remember is that this might just be a phone call to you. Yeah, but it's actually part of a bigger picture, part of a more exciting picture. This is a touchpoint with a colleague, a customer. It's an opportunity to build a relationship and you are only going to win in your career if you have really strong relationships. So yeah, it's just a phone call to you right now, but it's so much bigger than that. It really is. It's your opportunity to start building really wonderful relationships with your colleagues and customers. So totally be confident. Take on board what I've said today.

However, securing a role in management when you don\u2019t have experience can often deem you unsuitable for the roles which can be a little bit annoying, some recruiters will instantly dismiss your CV because you don\u2019t have the word manager. Or they\u2019ll just ignore your application because you haven\u2019t made it clear enough that you have the right skills.", "As hard as it may seem, getting your break into management isn\u2019t always that difficult, because what you can do is quite simple, start by understanding what a manager is, what they do and what their value within that business is. Firstly, you need to understand the characteristics needed, then you must reconcile this with the skills that you have, and lastly, I need you to understand the areas that you may need to get experience in, so to fill those gaps, and strengthen your case. Here are a few traits associated with a good manager.\u00a0", "For instance, managers are usually very good at planning, multitasking, managing conflict within situations, people skills, leadership skills, using their initiative, usually have good communication skills, and they\u2019re normally quite good at budgeting or reporting, they have experience in that area. There are often opportunities for you long term to have a little look at this and how can you possibly gain experience in these areas. There\u2019s other things and the list goes on but ultimately they\u2019re the main things. Now you\u2019ve got an idea of what a good manager has, I want us to maybe have a little look at the ways that you can develop some of these skills, so in this video we\u2019re just going to look at three ways.", "\u00a0", "One, offer to lead a project. Let\u2019s say that you\u2019re in a marketing department, you could offer to manage the implementation of a new piece of software that\u2019s coming in. There\u2019s lots of measurable stuff you can crack on with there, you most probably won\u2019t need any people or budgeting experience but certainly when it comes to managing a project that would be fabulous for you. You\u2019ll be hitting deadlines, managing communications, being accountable, so all activities associated with a budding manager.", "\u00a0", "The next thing, you can offer to train some staff. Let\u2019s look at that that example again, so maybe that software is coming in. Maybe you can demonstrate not only your communication skills and ability to implement it, but maybe you can help train people. Ben in the team may take to software really, really well whereas Sarah might need a few more lessons, people a bit like me, so you can adjust your training based on the end user. Again this just shows your people skills and you can understand people.", "\u00a0", "And then thirdly, go out and get some experience of managing conflict. Conflict isn\u2019t always about people screaming at each other, maybe two of your team members just aren\u2019t really getting along or communicating as well. Maybe there\u2019s a junior member of the team that\u2019s feeling a little bit demotivated because of the way somebody is speaking to them at the moment. Maybe they\u2019re just not gelling well, and its impacting the project of the overall team output. Maybe you can offer to step in and coach or mentor somebody within that environment. There\u2019s loads of ways that you can help to manage conflict. This experience can sometimes be slightly trickier because usually HR can come in and sort it out, but like I said it\u2019s not always screaming and massive conflict situations, maybe it\u2019s just about getting two people to just communicate a little better.", "\u00a0", "In conclusion there are lots and lots of things that you can do in order to hone your managerial skills, even without the managerial job title. And then when you are doing these things I want you to keep track of them, make notes of them, what was the output, so that you can then draw on these experiences again within applications, CVs, interviews, that kind of thing.", "\u00a0", "So hopefully that\u2019s added value, and if you want to get any more advice go over to Careercake.com and look at our courses, our other insight videos.

We want that interviewer and those people we meet to know that this matters to us. That is going to be impressive, so don\u2019t beat yourself up about being nervous, it\u2019s a good thing. What we do want to do however, is find that balance so that these nerves are not crippling us.", "So, the first thing I\u2019m going to ask you to do is prepare. And now you are sitting here watching this video thinking, \u2018you want me to prepare, that\u2019s obvious\u2019. But I do want you to prepare and I know that every blog on this topic tells you to do that, but have you really done it. Because I always say to people, \u2018yeah I know that\u2019, but do I actually do it? Not always.

Even in a nervous state. And just to prove that point, I promise you, sometimes you will hear a song you haven\u2019t heard for ten years. You haven\u2019t heard it but you can still remember all of the words. It\u2019s because your body is used to saying them because you sing them. So practice your interview answers out loud. Whether you are driving your car, hovering, annoying all your friends because you are in the kitchen talking to yourself it seems. Just do it, I promise you it will help.", "The next things are to get familiar with the people, if you can. Look for any opportunity you can to meet anybody, and not just the people who are interviewing you, anybody who works there, before your interview. That will help. Like one of my friends today was telling me (I told him I was making this video) he said, \u2018oh my goodness, I had an interview a few years ago and I took a drive there on a Sunday, drove around, even got out of the car and looked through the window, so that on the day, that building, this place was already familiar to me and helped me with my nerves\u2019. Get familiar and do a drive by if you can.", "The next thing, surround yourself with a lighter about an hour before your interview. I\u2019m not asking you to go out there and light some candles, a lighter is someone who makes you feel incredible. We all have a lighter in our lives, hopefully. Maybe it\u2019s our mum, dad, boyfriend, girlfriend, colleague or a mentor. Somebody who can make you feel like you can take over the world. That person. I want you to schedule a call if you can, or even a meet up face to face if you can, about an hour before your interview. If you can get your mind-set straight. If you can feel like you\u2019re invincible and you can do this, it will impact everything that you do in that interview. Your headspace and the way you portray yourself is just as important as the world that come out of your mouth, so work on that.", "\u00a0", "Another little tip, speak to someone about a problem that you know the answer to. So maybe take that work call with that customer you know you can help or that colleague who is really struggling with something and you know, on this topic, you are the expert. If you can elevate yourself just before the interview, again, it will help your confidence and your mind-set. Even if it is nothing to do with work. Even if it is a friend who is going through a really bad time at the moment and you want to be able to help them. It will make you feel valued and you are going to go in that room feeling a little bit kick-ass. That\u2019s a good thing.", "\u00a0", "The next thing, music. Music is so powerful. Music helps us feel things and we do not use it enough.

They sue it in adverts, movies. It makes us cry at the MasterCard advert (I\u2019m such a soppy one and I love that advert, it always gets me). Do you sue music to effect your mood? You should.", "\u00a0", "Think about your game song. What\u2019s your game song? Your game song, again, is a song that makes you feel amazing. I have, Rolling Stones, sympathy for the devil. Its little bit arrogant. Mick Jagger has got that arrogance and sometimes I need to fee off that. What\u2019s your game song? And your game song can be anything. It can be the spice girls, that\u2019s fine or it could be something super cool I haven\u2019t even heard of. It\u2019s that song that when it comes on you are like, \u2018Yeah!\u2019. Play it. Maybe even get a playlist together. Listen to it. Use music.", "\u00a0", "The next thing I want to give you some advice on id breathing. This is something that has only come to be late in my life. It was one of those things I\u2019d heard about, but never did it. If you can use breathing exercises beforehand, for about twenty minutes before your interview, I promise you\u2026this isn\u2019t just fluffy advice, this stuff works. I breathe in for four and hold for two and I do that four or five times. I do that when I\u2019m doing key note speeches, when I\u2019ve got a really big business meeting. I still get nervous and breathing is a big one for me.", "\u00a0", "The next thing is, be careful how you are talking to yourself. There is a lovely quote, be careful how you talk to yourself, because you are listening. It\u2019s so true. If you tell yourself that you are about to mess this up, you\u2019re going to mess this up. You need to tell yourself positive things, because what we think, we become. You don\u2019t want this incident whereby you are telling yourself, this is going to be a nightmare, I\u2019m going to mess it up. Because now you are just in a negative head mess and nothing good can come from that. Start visualising what would happen and how it feels when you have finished that interview and you have had a lovely, wonderful conversation with them. They like you, you like them and you re feeling like you want to work there. Visualise a positive outcome. What does it feel like? How are you feeling when you are driving home? Really get yourself in that head space.", "\u00a0", "The next thing I want you to do is don\u2019t apologise. If you are in the interview and you feel \u2018I\u2019m still a little bit nervous\u2019. Again, go back to the visualisation thing and visualise the positivity. But if you are in that room and you are feeling a little bit nervous, don\u2019t apologise for it. What you do when you say, \u2018sorry, I\u2019m a little bit nervous\u2019 is you are drawing attention to it and no everyone in the room is focusing on the one thing you didn\u2019t really want to focus on, because you brought it up. And now as an interviewer, I\u2019m nervous because I don\u2019t want you to feel nervous and I\u2019m apologising to you. I don\u2019t want to make anyone feel uncomfortable. That\u2019s not my game plan. So now I feel a little bit on edge. We don\u2019t want that kind of dynamic in the room.

My first point being, please remember this, the interviewer gets nervous too. Not all of them, but a lot of them. You wouldn\u2019t believe in business show many people get asked to go out and interview perspective new employees and they\u2019ve never had any interview training. No-one has ever told them how to be a good interviewer. They just get asked to go and interview somebody. They do get nervous too. I\u2019ve been in this game over fifteen years. The amount of people I\u2019ve had to go and speak to to do training because they get nervous and they want to be the best interviewer they can be. There are loads of them. I remember one guy a couple of years ago who owned an accountancy practice. Really smart, lovely man. When he got nervous he said he had verbal diarrhoea. He said awkward things and it probably made people not want to be around him. I actually loved him because of this. How socially awkward he was, was one of my favourite things about him. But he didn\u2019t want to portray himself like that in an interview and he knows that in interviews he gets nervous. I went in and helped him with the interview and he sat there and made some notes and chipped in now and again, but I ran the interview, because he was too nervous to do it and that was his own business. So just remember that.", "The next thing and I just want to end of this, you\u2019re interviewing them too. This isn\u2019t just, I\u2019m going to go into this room and are they going to like me? Think, I\u2019m going into this room now and am I going to like them? Because you\u2019re giving that business and opportunity. You\u2019re giving that business your time and your time is just as valuable as their time. So, get a bit of that power back and think this is a two-way process. This isn\u2019t just them judging you. This is a two way, am I going to want to work with them, just as much as are they going to want to work with me. Take that power and remember the value that you bring \u2013 really important.", "Ok, hopefully that\u2019s helped.

Maybe some days you just feel really sad, or maybe some weeks you have really low mood and you don't know why. There's no real reason. Feeling like a failure, feeling helpless, feeling trapped, feeling defeated, and increased cynicism and negative outlook on the world and just on situations in general. Maybe you've got an increased feeling of anxiety, or maybe it's the detachment. Maybe it's just feeling really alone and really numb. Then you've got behavioural signs of Burnout, so this is where you could be maybe snappy or angry. Maybe you're overreacting to situations that normally wouldn't bother you, but that's like you've got sunburn and normally if you touch your skin, it doesn't hurt, but if you've got somebody in touch his skin, it's like you overreact.

And maybe the same goes for your drinking.", "So we've looked at the signs and the symptoms and you might've noticed a few of those yourself.

Maybe you\u2019re doing a great job, but nobody's telling you. Maybe you're working in a chaotic environment in an ever changing environment, highly pressurized. Or doing tasks that are monotonous and totally unchallenging and completely boring.", "Or number two - lifestyle. So, this could be where you're just working too much and you're not spending enough time socializing, relaxing. Or maybe there's a lack of sadly supportive relationships in your life and maybe you're taking on too much responsibility or maybe everything's fine but you're just not getting enough sleep.", "And then there's the personality that could be a cause of it. Your personality, are you a perfectionist? Do things never seem to ever be good enough? Are you quite pessimistic? Do you have quite a negative view of the world and sometimes have low self-confidence? Do you feel like you need to be in control of loads of things? Are you a high achiever? Do you tend to set yourself - this is what I do - set yourself huge targets to achieve? So, it could be one of those things. It could be all of those things, but we really need to start thinking about what is the cause because if we know what the cause is, we can start doing something about it.", "Now this video is just about burnout at work, so I'm going to focus there. And there are two different types of burnout that you may have in the workplace. There's the ", "worn-out burnout", ", and they're the people that are just worn out. They're struggling with the day to day challenges and ultimately then they just choose to neglect their work because they're feeling too much pressure. They might want to achieve something and you know, reach that goal. They haven't got the energy anymore to actually power through to get there. These are the people that have just got too much on their plates. Now. People often adopt a negative tone during this time. They might complain or feel really negative and just vent about their work because they've just got overload. I mean, it's just total overload.", "And then the other type is being under-challenged. Okay, so it's the ", "under-challenged burnout", " and these are where people are just generally not getting any satisfaction from their work. They're like, \u201cWhat's the point?\u201d Employees that experience this type of burnout might be doing stuff that is really boring, so they're distracted. They don't really want to do their work because it's really unrewarding. Now it is worth noting that you might feel these things at some time, okay? Even the happiest people who absolutely love their job like me sometimes feel these things and it's totally normal. It's just when you start feeling these things, more than not feeling these things. You know when these feelings are the norm - that's when you've just got to stop and look at things.", "So, my first piece of advice is to actually give up on trying to get motivated. Stop beating yourself up about it. Because even trying to feel positive, even trying to feel positive and then stay there can take up energy that you just don't have right now. I know that when I was experiencing burnout quite badly, I would beat myself up all day long because I wasn't feeling positive because I wasn't feeling motivated. Because \u201cWhy are you feeling sad, you loser?\u201d It was horrible. Basically it was like a vicious circle. So firstly, stop it. Stop beating yourself up that you have burnout. You have and you're not the only person in the world and you won't be the only person in the future, Okay? So it's okay.", "Secondly, I would love you to take some time out so take some annual leave, but use this annual leave to recover. And what I mean by that is that sometimes when we take annual leave, we try and cram loads of stuff in \u2018cause our days off are valuable. You might only have 20, you might only have 25 days annual leave a year. You want to do all of the good stuff and, you know, you've got to renovate the bathroom or paint the kitchen or something or visit these family members that you never get to see.", "Take this time to just do things that bring you joy, yeah? You've got the rest of your life to paint the kitchen. You've got loads of time to renovate that other room, catch up on the ironing and all that \u2013 unless you like ironing, like me. Just do stuff that brings you joy. And if you're going to go on holiday, think about the type of holiday, cause sometimes when we go on holiday, they could be more stress than they're worth. You know, there's a lack of sleep. Maybe you've got a tight agenda, you've got to stick to. Maybe a lot of travelling, a lot of things that need you to think about things and process things. Ever come back from holiday and go, \u201cOh my goodness, I really need a holiday to get over the holiday.\u201d? Again, this is not the time for that. This is the time for stopping and recovering.", "Next, let's look at the stuff that you're putting into your mind. We know that at the moment your mind has got sunburn, like I said earlier, or it\u2019s overstimulated. So, let's just look at what you're going to put in there. So, firstly, maybe social media - just take a little bit of a break. Now if you are always checking Facebook, if you're always checking Instagram then that might be like \u201cNo way!\u201d. All of those things, all of these people, those apps are still going to be there in three months, if you do a 12 week break, which is what I did. And yeah, just stop looking, stop comparing, stop looking at all of these people having a fabulous time when you do not feel fabulous. And then also I would say stop trying to fix this by reading books. That's another thing. So, people will always be - and I'm a massive fan of self-development, if you've watched any of my stuff, you know that I'm always reading, I'm always learning - just not now. Yeah, not when you've got burnout. It's okay to not be reading self-development books and trying to read your way out of it by educating yourself on the problem and the solution. When I had burnout, one of the things that I did, which I found really helpful was, I actually promised myself that I wasn't going to read any self-development books and all I was going to do is read fiction. And not only did I just start reading fiction, but I went back to Roald Dahl stuff. I went back to the stuff that I was reading when I was a child. So, I was a 35 year old woman reading James and the Giant Peach and The Twits. And I loved it. It was just - it's not mind-numbing because they're obviously interesting stories - but it was just a case of not learning, yeah? Not stimulating anything.", "And then another thing that I did as well, which I'd love to just share with you, is that I stopped watching some of the stuff on telly. So, I stopped watching the news, I stopped watching thrillers. There was stuff like Luther I wouldn't watch that all my friends were talking about and people at work. All I did for a period of time, I can\u2019t remember how long it was, but it was quite a period of time, was watch Family Guy and I would watch comedies and unless it was a comedy - Gavin and Stacey, I'd watch that over and over again, or the Royle Family, you know, just stuff that's just good comedy stuff and I would watch that. Because what you put in your mind, it's like what you eat affects your body, what you put in your mind affects your mind. So just be careful that you're not putting anything that could potentially be toxic for you right now in here.", "So hopefully you've stopped beating yourself up about the fact that you don't feel positive. You've taken a holiday, some recovery time, you\u2019ve thought about what kinds of things you're putting into your brain - so the books you read, the stuff you watch on telly, social media activity. No matter what type of burnout you have, all of these things are really, really positive for you. But I'm just gonna assume that you're back and you're working towards your recovery and now I'm going to give you some practical advice depending on what type of burnout. So, if you have worn-out burnout, you could start by maybe going back into work and talking to your boss about your hours that you work. Maybe they could be restructured just temporarily. Maybe you could take more breaks, ask a colleague to go for lunch with you every day and then you've got some accountability there. You have to take a lunch hour.", "Be Realistic about accepting tasks from people so are people's demands a little bit too unrealistic at the moment. Maybe we can start saying no to things.", "And the things that challenge you, you know the stuff that you might want to do to work towards your personal development, may just need to go on hold for a little while. We've all got tasks that we can do and skills that just come naturally to us when - I like to call it - when we're in our flow, so do more of that stuff for now. It's like if you've got physical burnout, you wouldn\u2019t want to go to the gym and lift loads of weights and work really hard, but you could still maybe go for a bike ride or enjoy a really nice walk.", "Next, schedule reading your emails so that, and it's only a little thing, but just so that you just read them once in the morning, lunchtime or end of the day so that you're not just constantly being interrupted by other people's demands. And then ask yourself, is your work environment contributing to your burnout? Is it a little bit crazy? It's a little bit manic. Does it need to be that way? But maybe you could one day a week work from home? Ask your manager, even again if it's just temporarily.", "So, what if you've identified that you may have under-challenged burnout? Well, here's some practical tips for you.", "Firstly, speak to your manager, to your boss. Ask if there's any extra responsibilities that you can take on. Maybe there's a promotion you can work towards. Or even if it's just a sideways move, it could be something different. And if you can't get that differentiation at work then think of a side project that you can do in your own time, because creativity is an antidote to under-challenged burnout. It's not always good, I have to say, if you've got worn-out burnout to be trying new things, to be challenging yourself. But if you've got under-challenged burnout, creativity is exactly what you need to be doing. Doing something fun can help relieve the stress. Because, basically, what you're doing, is that you want to be more, you want to do more, you want to be creative, but you're having to rein yourself in. You\u2019re feeling under-challenged and reining that in and just being happy with what you've got and what you're doing takes energy and that's why, sorry, you're feeling burnt out.", "So, a friend of mine started upcycling furniture and then she was selling it on Gumtree and she was really good it, actually she made a bit of money, but she was really excited. She was energized by it because it can be really easy just getting into a slump and doing the same thing all the time. Doing something new can bring you joy. So find something that will bring you joy, I don\u2019t know, kayaking, photography that's just good for the soul.", "Now next I'm going to talk about isolating yourself. It's not very good when you've got under\u2011challenged burnout to isolate yourself and withdraw from people. You\u2019ve got worn-out burnout that\u2019s possibly what you need to do for a little bit of time, but if you\u2019re under-challenged, it's important that you're surrounded by friends, you're surrounded by family, you need that support. It can be as simple as sharing feelings or ideas with another person. Maybe it's your HR manager, someone you trust at work, a colleague, and you don't have to go into too much detail. How much detail do you do that went to is completely up to you, but telling them how you feel, asking them for help gives them the chance to support you.", "\u00a0", "Having spent over a decade as a leading recruiter, Aimee has placed over 5000 people into employment, from start-ups to large global firms.

You don\u2019t have to be straight to be an ally. For example, I feel that I am ally to others within the broader LGBT community. Whilst I am not transgender or bi-sexual, I feel that I can still actively support my bi-sexual and transgender colleagues. I also act an ally for my BAME colleagues and friends. So, what are some easy ways to be an ally?", "Get to know and understand the issues", "Speak to LGBT colleagues about their experiences", "Try to understand some of the challenges they face", "If you\u2019re worried about saying the wrong thing or using the wrong language \u2013 don\u2019t worry. Just ask! I would much rather people around me felt able to ask questions, so that I can explain or perhaps help them to develop their own awareness and understanding. Let\u2019s face it, there is a lot of language, a lot of acronyms and terminology involved, which can make it seem really difficult as a subject area. People\u2019s fear of offending or saying the wrong thing, can sometimes prevent them from engaging at all. I think that I have a responsibility to make people feel comfortable enough to ask questions, by creating safe spaces for conversations or acknowledging to others how very complicated it can all seem. You might have noticed that I have used the acronym LGBT throughout and yet there are many organisations and people, that use LGBTQ (to include Queer or Questioning)", "LGBT+ (to include a range of other identities) and several other acronyms are used too. I particularly like LGBT+ because I feel this is inclusive of all and encompasses a range of sexualities and gender identities. For the purpose of this session, I have simply stuck with LGBT for simplicity, but please note this is not intended to be in any way exclusive.", "Back to allies. An LGBT ally simply says \u201cI believe in equality and I want my LGBT colleagues to be able to be out and feel comfortable at work. As an ally I will challenge homophobic, biphobic and transphobic language in the workplace and I commit to trying to create a more inclusive environment for all'.", "I would encourage you to not just \u2018talk the talk\u2019 but make your commitment really visible to others. For example, why not attend events that are focussed on the issues of that community. This year I marched in the London Pride parade alongside over 250 of my Citi colleagues. Many of these people were our straight allies, who showed their support by visibly and actively supporting their LGBT colleagues and friends.", "Another thing I would suggest that can be helpful is to try and avoid making assumptions about others and think about the language you use. For example, when asking people about their personal life, instead of saying girlfriend/boyfriend, husband or wife, why not simply say \u2018partner\u2019? This sends a clear message that you haven\u2019t made an assumption and creates the opportunity for someone to open up if they wish to.", "I would also encourage you to listen out for cues. It may well be the case that someone is considering coming out and is trying to open up to you. In which case, if you are tuned in to what are people are saying, you might well be able to make the process easier for them. In my experience, in the early stages of coming out, an individual will often seek out just one or two people to confide in. This is part of the process of learning to trust people and plays a big part in someone developing their confidence to come out more publicly. Perhaps you can be that friend, that trusted individual? If so, you can play a significant part in helping them on their journey to becoming truly out and visible at work. If this is the case, don\u2019t forget how important it is to respect the fact they have chosen you as a confidant.

Watch this video to learn about Careercake's top 10 rules of telephone etiquette. We'll cover how to be confident and how to prepare as well as things like how to act if the call has been transferred to you by mistake.\u00a0", "Hi, my name is Aimee Bateman, career coach and founder of Careercake.", "In this video we're going to look at the ", "10 rules of telephone etiquette", " because so much attention is placed on online communications - so emails, LinkedIn messages, tweets, social media - that the skill of actually influencing or even just talking on the phone is a bit of a lost art. But answering the phone even if you hate it, which I know a lot of people do and phone etiquette are still have really big part of the experience that you give your customers, the experience you give you clients, your suppliers, your colleagues. So here are my thoughts and my tips for keeping it sweet.", "So my first tip is to ", "take notes", ". So make sure that you've got a pen and some paper, maybe an iPad, a notepad. You are at your desk so it's likely that you've got one there. What you don't want to do is have to put somebody on hold or delay the call while you go and find a pen or while you go to find some paper.", "Number two, ", "introduce yourself", "; now this is a bit of an obvious one but it\u2019s worth mentioning because you should really introduce yourself at the beginning of the call; the first thing that you say, and then you can start building rapport.", "Number three, ", "pick a positive tone", ". Now your tone of voice is so important and I said pick a positive tone because how you deliver your tone, how you feel, is your choice. You have a choice to be positive. You have a choice to be negative. And when you don't have that body language to influence the situation, you know most of what we communicate is not verbally, it's through our body language, but you're on the phone so there isn't any body language. So you'll need to make up for that feeling, the feeling that you're giving off by your tone of voice. Your tone is so important. So, make sure it's upbeat. Make sure it's really positive and even if you've been answering the phone for 10 years and work, especially if you've been answering the phone at work for 10 years because it's easy to forget. Remember that your tone of voice can affect and impact the person on the other end. So just take a moment, literally just one, two seconds, pause, smile, and then pick positive.", "The fourth point - ", "slow it down", ". So if you're rushed like, [speaks quickly] \u201cHi, Careercake, Aimee speaking\u201d \u00a0- that was really rubbish acting! - but if you're really rushed, it may make the person feel like you can't really be bothered to talk to them or you're really busy and in fact they were interrupting you. And again, there\u2019s no body language so they can't see your lips, they can't see the words being created. And sometimes when we're looking at somebody and they're talking quite quickly, that's how we help and understand what it is that they're saying. This is really hard for me because I'm Welsh and not all, but most Welsh people tend to talk really quickly. So this is something that I've had to constantly remember to do, especially when I'm filming. But more importantly, when I'm on the phone, I want to make everyone feel like they understand me. I don't want anybody feeling frustrated that they didn't fully catch what I was saying. And also by taking the time and not rushing, it makes that person feel like you're not rushing them. They matter to you. You've got the time to give them.", "So ", "what to do if the phone call isn't for you", ". So they've called and it's not your department even. Definitely not for you. You don't want to firstly make them feel like they've made a mistake and blame them and be like, \u201cOh well I'm sorry, but you want the highways department, you've got the wrong number.\u201d It's not their fault that they've got the wrong number. You want to say that it's okay that they've got the wrong number. Help them. Don\u2019t just leave them to it \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019ve got the wrong number, off you go - you've probably had calls like that before. I have and I just think \u201cCheers. That's the number that was on the website. Thanks for helping me or not helping me\u201d. Tell them it's okay. Totally fine \u2013 \u201cI can help you.\u201d It doesn't matter how busy you are - \u201cI can help you. That's fine\u201d. Transfer them, put them on hold, find the number for them. What you want to do is when they do get transferred to the next department, you want that person to say, \u201cOh, this really super cool person in X department just now helped me. They were really nice\u201d. You don't want them to say, \u201cOh finally spoken to who I want to speak to. I spoke to a really rude colleague of yours.\u201d You don't want to be that person ever. But I do want to say this, just before you put them on hold or just before you transfer them, ask them if it's okay. Tell them that that's what you're going to do. Don't just go quiet on them. I've been on the phone before, it's just gone dead and I'm like, \u201cHello, is anyone there?\u201d and they've just transferred me. But they haven't told me that that's what they were doing and it just feels a little bit off. So, tell them \u201cIt's okay\u201d. Help them. Ask their permission before you transfer the call and just really nice little touch. Give them the number. So even if you transfer them, give them the number just in case they get cut off, or just in case they need to have a direct number in the future, because if you transfer them, they might not still have the right number. So always do that as well.", "So telephone etiquette, number six, the sixth rule. What if you\u2019re just really busy, like genuinely really busy and you don't have the time for the call? Well, if it's your boss or if it's a really pressing issue, then you probably need to find the time, but if not, it's not your boss and ", "it's not a really pressing issue, then you can just bat it away", ". You can bat it away. But do it like this - So if Janet in Finance has called \u2013 \u201cAre you really busy?\u201d Don't just go \u201cJanet, sorry, I'm going to stop you there. I'm really busy.\u201d because that can be a little bit dismissive, a little bit rude. Just give her a moment to just explain herself and what's going on. Don't interrupt her, let her finish her bit and then say with that smile on your face, with that positivity, \u201cThank you for calling. Really, really want to help you with that. I genuinely do. I do have something that needs my attention right now.\u201d Tell her that it's really important, but you have something that really needs to happen right now and that you'll call her back or you're looking into it or \u201cCan I give you a ring back?\u201d and then whatever time you say you're going to give her a ring back, make sure you give her a ring back. So always do what you say you're going to do and that's an absolutely fine way to handle that situation.", "Number seven is ", "don't allow any interruptions", ". Do not let yourself be distracted by any conversations or people around you. The person on the phone right now is your priority. Definitely a priority of anybody that comes into the office or any hand signals that your colleagues are doing or all of your emails coming in. You might be on the phone and reading emails, so don\u2019t do that. I have a really busy office. I have my colleague Ellen, I've got my colleague Alison next to me. There's a lot of us in quite a small office. There's always stuff going on and I'll just turn my chair. So I\u2019ll turn my chair and I'll just face the wall sometimes when I'm having a telephone conversation, then there's no distractions. Because what you want is that person to be, in that moment, it.", "So rule number eight, ", "check your voicemail", ". If you do have that voicemail functionality, check it at least once a day. It's really frustrating for colleagues if you're trying to get hold of somebody. It's happened to me before trying to get hold of a colleague because there's a project that you're working on, you really need their input but they never get back to you. The reason they don't get back to you is because they didn't know you called because they never check their voicemail. So check it. That's what it's there for. I would say that people will appreciate you getting back to them really quickly so if you could check it more than once a day, that'd be great. But if you're really, really busy - you know, head down - once a day is okay. I do want to say this though - don't be that person who permanently has their voicemail on. It's almost like the default - voicemail on; don't want to talk to anyone. The reason being is that it can be really frustrating. You're not building relationships with colleagues, it\u2019s a big barrier to everybody in the organisation and whether you like it or not, no matter how busy you are, communicating with your colleagues, helping each other is part of the game. It's part of the processes. The reason why businesses and organisations are successful. So even if you're tempted to just put your voicemail on because you\u2019ve got a lot to do that day. Don't. Think, \u201cCan I just maybe put it on for an hour? Maybe just the morning.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Don't have it on default. Don\u2019t be that person.", "So rule number nine, ", "leaving voice messages", ". Just take all of the positive, all of the good stuff from this video and apply it here. So even though you're not talking to a person, they're still a person that's going to be listening back. And we've all listened to audio books or podcasts where the content's really good, but the person just sounds really miserable. So you want to smile, you want to be really positive and you want to be clear. So you might want to leave your phone number - do it twice, leave your phone number, then repeat your phone number so they've got chance to double check it. And if you're not so used to telephone conversations and you're more used to online - LinkedIn messages, emails - and you're not used to listening to the sound of your voice, it's okay to just record yourself because you might think that you'd be really clear. You might think that you\u2019re sounding really positive, but when you listen to it again - maybe not so much. So it's always worth just practicing recording and listening back because that's what the other person's going to hear.", "Finally, rule number 10 ", "ending the call with impact", ". One of the sayings I love is \u201cPeople forget what you said. They will forget what you did, but they will never forget the way you made them feel.\u201d And this is so important and very true when it comes to phone calls. So, you want them to leave this phone call feeling really positive about that touchpoint with you. So what you want to do is just thank them for calling, ask them is there anything else I can help you with and then compliment them \u2013 \u201cYou're doing some really good stuff over in finance. I'm really glad I was able to add value in some way. If there's anything I can do in future, you just let me know.\u201d Make them feel really good about themselves and glad that they picked up the phone and spoke to you.", "One of the things that I think is important to remember is that this might just be a phone call to you. Yeah, but it's actually part of a bigger picture, part of a more exciting picture. This is a touchpoint with a colleague, a customer. It's an opportunity to build a relationship and you are only going to win in your career if you have really strong relationships. So yeah, it's just a phone call to you right now, but it's so much bigger than that. It really is. It's your opportunity to start building really wonderful relationships with your colleagues and customers. So totally be confident. Take on board what I've said today. Practice, get on the phone and don\u2019t be frightened if you hear it ringing and pick it up.

Firstly, you need to understand the characteristics needed, then you must reconcile this with the skills that you have, and lastly, I need you to understand the areas that you may need to get experience in, so to fill those gaps, and strengthen your case. Here are a few traits associated with a good manager.\u00a0", "For instance, managers are usually very good at planning, multitasking, managing conflict within situations, people skills, leadership skills, using their initiative, usually have good communication skills, and they\u2019re normally quite good at budgeting or reporting, they have experience in that area. There are often opportunities for you long term to have a little look at this and how can you possibly gain experience in these areas. There\u2019s other things and the list goes on but ultimately they\u2019re the main things. Now you\u2019ve got an idea of what a good manager has, I want us to maybe have a little look at the ways that you can develop some of these skills, so in this video we\u2019re just going to look at three ways.", "\u00a0", "One, offer to lead a project. Let\u2019s say that you\u2019re in a marketing department, you could offer to manage the implementation of a new piece of software that\u2019s coming in.

You\u2019ll be hitting deadlines, managing communications, being accountable, so all activities associated with a budding manager.", "\u00a0", "The next thing, you can offer to train some staff. Let\u2019s look at that that example again, so maybe that software is coming in. Maybe you can demonstrate not only your communication skills and ability to implement it, but maybe you can help train people. Ben in the team may take to software really, really well whereas Sarah might need a few more lessons, people a bit like me, so you can adjust your training based on the end user. Again this just shows your people skills and you can understand people.", "\u00a0", "And then thirdly, go out and get some experience of managing conflict. Conflict isn\u2019t always about people screaming at each other, maybe two of your team members just aren\u2019t really getting along or communicating as well. Maybe there\u2019s a junior member of the team that\u2019s feeling a little bit demotivated because of the way somebody is speaking to them at the moment. Maybe they\u2019re just not gelling well, and its impacting the project of the overall team output. Maybe you can offer to step in and coach or mentor somebody within that environment. There\u2019s loads of ways that you can help to manage conflict. This experience can sometimes be slightly trickier because usually HR can come in and sort it out, but like I said it\u2019s not always screaming and massive conflict situations, maybe it\u2019s just about getting two people to just communicate a little better.", "\u00a0", "In conclusion there are lots and lots of things that you can do in order to hone your managerial skills, even without the managerial job title.

The right amount of busyness and noise for an extrovert easily becomes too much for an introvert, who already has a lot going on inside.", "The blood of extroverts and introverts followed different pathways in the brain. The introverts\u2019 pathway was longer, taking in the frontal areas of the brain associated with problem solving and planning: introverts were focused on their internal worlds. By contrast, the extroverts\u2019 pathway was much shorter and flowed to the sensory parts of the brain: the extroverts were focussed on the world around them.", "The different pathways followed were linked to different neurotransmitters.

He can't quite catch your breath. That comes from lazy, lethargic, breathing when you're only using part of your lung. I had this.", "Change in appetite and maybe you're less hungry or maybe like me, you're just eating all the time. You're always hungry.", "Change in sleep. Maybe you can't sleep or maybe actually it's the opposite. You're feeling lethargic and you are tired all the time and all you want to do is sleep and you can't get out of bed.", "You've got low energy or maybe you've got low immune system. Maybe you're feeling poorly more often. Maybe you, you're getting a bad throat, you're getting quite a lot of colds, and then there's the emotional signs of burnout, which could be loss of motivation. Maybe some days you just feel really sad, or maybe some weeks you have really low mood and you don't know why. There's no real reason. Feeling like a failure, feeling helpless, feeling trapped, feeling defeated, and increased cynicism and negative outlook on the world and just on situations in general. Maybe you've got an increased feeling of anxiety, or maybe it's the detachment. Maybe it's just feeling really alone and really numb. Then you've got behavioural signs of Burnout, so this is where you could be maybe snappy or angry. Maybe you're overreacting to situations that normally wouldn't bother you, but that's like you've got sunburn and normally if you touch your skin, it doesn't hurt, but if you've got somebody in touch his skin, it's like you overreact. Withdrawing; skipping work entirely. Maybe you're just leaving early, you know, procrastinating, taking longer than usual to do things.", "Or maybe it's like you're forgetting things. Yeah, the forgetfulness that can creep in too or just isolating yourself, which is what I did. Maybe you\u2019re smoking, maybe you're taking up smoking, or if you do smoke, you\u2019re smoking more than usual. And maybe the same goes for your drinking.", "So we've looked at the signs and the symptoms and you might've noticed a few of those yourself. But in order to really do something about this now and to safeguard ourselves, we have to first identify the causes of this burnout. And it's not always that simple. It's not that black and white. It's not like, \u201cOh, it's that thing\u201d or \u201cI have burnout because of that.\u201d", "But here are the three main causes of burnout.", "So, the first one tends to be work. So you\u2019re feeling like you've got little or no control over your work right now. Maybe there are some over-demanding expectations on you, or maybe those expectations are slightly unclear.", "Maybe there's a lack of recognition and reward for doing a good job. Maybe you\u2019re doing a great job, but nobody's telling you. Maybe you're working in a chaotic environment in an ever changing environment, highly pressurized. Or doing tasks that are monotonous and totally unchallenging and completely boring.", "Or number two - lifestyle. So, this could be where you're just working too much and you're not spending enough time socializing, relaxing. Or maybe there's a lack of sadly supportive relationships in your life and maybe you're taking on too much responsibility or maybe everything's fine but you're just not getting enough sleep.", "And then there's the personality that could be a cause of it. Your personality, are you a perfectionist? Do things never seem to ever be good enough? Are you quite pessimistic? Do you have quite a negative view of the world and sometimes have low self-confidence? Do you feel like you need to be in control of loads of things? Are you a high achiever? Do you tend to set yourself - this is what I do - set yourself huge targets to achieve? So, it could be one of those things. It could be all of those things, but we really need to start thinking about what is the cause because if we know what the cause is, we can start doing something about it.", "Now this video is just about burnout at work, so I'm going to focus there. And there are two different types of burnout that you may have in the workplace. There's the ", "worn-out burnout", ", and they're the people that are just worn out. They're struggling with the day to day challenges and ultimately then they just choose to neglect their work because they're feeling too much pressure. They might want to achieve something and you know, reach that goal. They haven't got the energy anymore to actually power through to get there. These are the people that have just got too much on their plates. Now. People often adopt a negative tone during this time. They might complain or feel really negative and just vent about their work because they've just got overload. I mean, it's just total overload.", "And then the other type is being under-challenged. Okay, so it's the ", "under-challenged burnout", " and these are where people are just generally not getting any satisfaction from their work. They're like, \u201cWhat's the point?\u201d Employees that experience this type of burnout might be doing stuff that is really boring, so they're distracted. They don't really want to do their work because it's really unrewarding. Now it is worth noting that you might feel these things at some time, okay? Even the happiest people who absolutely love their job like me sometimes feel these things and it's totally normal. It's just when you start feeling these things, more than not feeling these things. You know when these feelings are the norm - that's when you've just got to stop and look at things.", "So, my first piece of advice is to actually give up on trying to get motivated. Stop beating yourself up about it. Because even trying to feel positive, even trying to feel positive and then stay there can take up energy that you just don't have right now. I know that when I was experiencing burnout quite badly, I would beat myself up all day long because I wasn't feeling positive because I wasn't feeling motivated. Because \u201cWhy are you feeling sad, you loser?\u201d It was horrible. Basically it was like a vicious circle. So firstly, stop it. Stop beating yourself up that you have burnout. You have and you're not the only person in the world and you won't be the only person in the future, Okay? So it's okay.", "Secondly, I would love you to take some time out so take some annual leave, but use this annual leave to recover. And what I mean by that is that sometimes when we take annual leave, we try and cram loads of stuff in \u2018cause our days off are valuable. You might only have 20, you might only have 25 days annual leave a year. You want to do all of the good stuff and, you know, you've got to renovate the bathroom or paint the kitchen or something or visit these family members that you never get to see.", "Take this time to just do things that bring you joy, yeah? You've got the rest of your life to paint the kitchen. You've got loads of time to renovate that other room, catch up on the ironing and all that \u2013 unless you like ironing, like me. Just do stuff that brings you joy. And if you're going to go on holiday, think about the type of holiday, cause sometimes when we go on holiday, they could be more stress than they're worth. You know, there's a lack of sleep. Maybe you've got a tight agenda, you've got to stick to. Maybe a lot of travelling, a lot of things that need you to think about things and process things. Ever come back from holiday and go, \u201cOh my goodness, I really need a holiday to get over the holiday.\u201d? Again, this is not the time for that. This is the time for stopping and recovering.", "Next, let's look at the stuff that you're putting into your mind. We know that at the moment your mind has got sunburn, like I said earlier, or it\u2019s overstimulated. So, let's just look at what you're going to put in there. So, firstly, maybe social media - just take a little bit of a break. Now if you are always checking Facebook, if you're always checking Instagram then that might be like \u201cNo way!\u201d. All of those things, all of these people, those apps are still going to be there in three months, if you do a 12 week break, which is what I did. And yeah, just stop looking, stop comparing, stop looking at all of these people having a fabulous time when you do not feel fabulous. And then also I would say stop trying to fix this by reading books. That's another thing. So, people will always be - and I'm a massive fan of self-development, if you've watched any of my stuff, you know that I'm always reading, I'm always learning - just not now. Yeah, not when you've got burnout. It's okay to not be reading self-development books and trying to read your way out of it by educating yourself on the problem and the solution. When I had burnout, one of the things that I did, which I found really helpful was, I actually promised myself that I wasn't going to read any self-development books and all I was going to do is read fiction. And not only did I just start reading fiction, but I went back to Roald Dahl stuff. I went back to the stuff that I was reading when I was a child. So, I was a 35 year old woman reading James and the Giant Peach and The Twits. And I loved it. It was just - it's not mind-numbing because they're obviously interesting stories - but it was just a case of not learning, yeah? Not stimulating anything.", "And then another thing that I did as well, which I'd love to just share with you, is that I stopped watching some of the stuff on telly. So, I stopped watching the news, I stopped watching thrillers. There was stuff like Luther I wouldn't watch that all my friends were talking about and people at work. All I did for a period of time, I can\u2019t remember how long it was, but it was quite a period of time, was watch Family Guy and I would watch comedies and unless it was a comedy - Gavin and Stacey, I'd watch that over and over again, or the Royle Family, you know, just stuff that's just good comedy stuff and I would watch that. Because what you put in your mind, it's like what you eat affects your body, what you put in your mind affects your mind. So just be careful that you're not putting anything that could potentially be toxic for you right now in here.", "So hopefully you've stopped beating yourself up about the fact that you don't feel positive. You've taken a holiday, some recovery time, you\u2019ve thought about what kinds of things you're putting into your brain - so the books you read, the stuff you watch on telly, social media activity. No matter what type of burnout you have, all of these things are really, really positive for you. But I'm just gonna assume that you're back and you're working towards your recovery and now I'm going to give you some practical advice depending on what type of burnout. So, if you have worn-out burnout, you could start by maybe going back into work and talking to your boss about your hours that you work. Maybe they could be restructured just temporarily. Maybe you could take more breaks, ask a colleague to go for lunch with you every day and then you've got some accountability there. You have to take a lunch hour.", "Be Realistic about accepting tasks from people so are people's demands a little bit too unrealistic at the moment. Maybe we can start saying no to things.", "And the things that challenge you, you know the stuff that you might want to do to work towards your personal development, may just need to go on hold for a little while. We've all got tasks that we can do and skills that just come naturally to us when - I like to call it - when we're in our flow, so do more of that stuff for now. It's like if you've got physical burnout, you wouldn\u2019t want to go to the gym and lift loads of weights and work really hard, but you could still maybe go for a bike ride or enjoy a really nice walk.", "Next, schedule reading your emails so that, and it's only a little thing, but just so that you just read them once in the morning, lunchtime or end of the day so that you're not just constantly being interrupted by other people's demands. And then ask yourself, is your work environment contributing to your burnout? Is it a little bit crazy? It's a little bit manic. Does it need to be that way? But maybe you could one day a week work from home? Ask your manager, even again if it's just temporarily.", "So, what if you've identified that you may have under-challenged burnout? Well, here's some practical tips for you.", "Firstly, speak to your manager, to your boss. Ask if there's any extra responsibilities that you can take on. Maybe there's a promotion you can work towards. Or even if it's just a sideways move, it could be something different. And if you can't get that differentiation at work then think of a side project that you can do in your own time, because creativity is an antidote to under-challenged burnout. It's not always good, I have to say, if you've got worn-out burnout to be trying new things, to be challenging yourself. But if you've got under-challenged burnout, creativity is exactly what you need to be doing. Doing something fun can help relieve the stress. Because, basically, what you're doing, is that you want to be more, you want to do more, you want to be creative, but you're having to rein yourself in. You\u2019re feeling under-challenged and reining that in and just being happy with what you've got and what you're doing takes energy and that's why, sorry, you're feeling burnt out.", "So, a friend of mine started upcycling furniture and then she was selling it on Gumtree and she was really good it, actually she made a bit of money, but she was really excited. She was energized by it because it can be really easy just getting into a slump and doing the same thing all the time. Doing something new can bring you joy. So find something that will bring you joy, I don\u2019t know, kayaking, photography that's just good for the soul.", "Now next I'm going to talk about isolating yourself. It's not very good when you've got under\u2011challenged burnout to isolate yourself and withdraw from people. You\u2019ve got worn-out burnout that\u2019s possibly what you need to do for a little bit of time, but if you\u2019re under-challenged, it's important that you're surrounded by friends, you're surrounded by family, you need that support. It can be as simple as sharing feelings or ideas with another person. Maybe it's your HR manager, someone you trust at work, a colleague, and you don't have to go into too much detail. How much detail do you do that went to is completely up to you, but telling them how you feel, asking them for help gives them the chance to support you.", "\u00a0", "Having spent over a decade as a leading recruiter, Aimee has placed over 5000 people into employment, from start-ups to large global firms.

Or you could have been talking to one of your colleagues about a situation that you've experienced and then when you pause, take a breath, they come in straight away, cut in with a similar situation that they've experienced that, actually, was nothing like your situation.

To build and support a team of awesome performers you need to understand what motivates them. Let Alex show you how to ask the right questions to understand what each member is looking for and how to really energise them.\u00a0", "So this chapter is about how well are you connected with what motivates each individual in your team. And you might be thinking, surely they should roll up and do a good job because I pay them a base salary. Well, no, because what a base salary gets you is someone turning up and doing a job. If you want someone to do a brilliant job, you need to unlock their discretionary effort and that is the effort they have got to give if they feel super engaged in what they are doing.", "And so, what that means is that you can\u2019t really make anyone do anything. Well you sort of can if you are standing over them, but most of you will be in teams where people still have to work hard when you are not there. So the art of a motivating meeting is that when your back is turned, they are still going to be working as hard as when you are there. And that is truly a test of whether a team is working well. And in some ways it\u2019s a little bit like if you are in sales. Customers can buy when you are there, but when they leave the shop do they cancel? Do they bring it back? Do they ever come back to you again? And so what we\u2019ve got to focus on as a manager, is actually getting people to want to buy what we want them to do rather than actually selling them. People love to buy and so what we have to be connected with is each individual\u2019s motivators, so we can sell and promote what we need people to do in a way that matches what that person's needs and is motivated by.", "Let\u2019s look at how individuals are motivated. Now, there are loads of different theories and philosophies around what motivates people. My personal favourite I use when I train people is the self determination theory. What that does is put motivators into two buckets, which keeps things simple. And so one bucket is extrinsic motivators. Extrinsic motivators are things that I get from an external body if I do something. For instance, if I hit a target, I maybe get a pay rise or I maybe get on a leaderboard. And then you\u2019ve got intrinsic motivators which are things I do because I want to feel better inside. And so the extrinsic motivators we are going to go through are probably more short term and the intrinsic ones are often the deeper things that inspire longer lasting behaviour.", "So extrinsic motivators. Firstly, status with managers or family. There are some people in your team who are motivated by your boss and your bosses boss thinking they are really good and you know as soon as that boss is coming into town, they are going to start working harder. Or it could be that they are motivated by showing their parents that they are standing on their own two feet, or they are able to have a job that is professional, credible and give them the status they want in life.", "The other form of status is status with your peers and friends. A lot of people are motivated by their friends thinking, \u201cwell, do you have a decent job?\u201d. I know when I entered the career workplace, all my friends became doctors, lawyers and accountants and I became a recruitment consultant. So, I was desperate to prove that my job was as credible as theirs. They were going to have letters after their name and I did a job that wasn\u2019t always very popular in the world.", "The other area of extrinsic motivators is competition. There are some individuals who love to be on a league table. They live to get recognition for doing things better than everybody else. Hence a lot of firms now are implementing peer to peer recognition systems that allow people to go,\u201d Cheers you just did me a good job\u201d. Because the pep of that motivation is what keeps a lot of people going. And the last area of intrinsic motivation is money or inquisitiveness. There are a lot of people who are motivated to work hard so they can buy a car, go on holiday, buy a handbag, shoes football season tickets, houses, pensions. And so when you understand someone is money motivated, it\u2019s really important that you don\u2019t just take money as an answer, but you are asking what they want to spend that money on.", "My manager would always ask, \u201cOK, you want a bonus, but what are you going to spend that money on?\u201d. Some months it was, I want to buy a home cinema. Other months I wanted to buy a car and as I got older I wanted to buy a house. But all of those things, my manager knew about and they could then could then use them as tools when I was feeling down and not doing what I need to do, to jeer me on a bit and increase that motivation.", "However, if you want long lasting change, intrinsic motivation is where you are going to get the biggest difference. And the three intrinsic motivators are firstly, autonomy. The desire to be autonomous in our work. The desire to be left alone and make decisions for ourselves (the decisions we think are right) in order to do the job as well as we can.", "The next area is mastery. That inner desire to feel like we are wanting to improve. Many of you watching this video will have sometimes been in a job for maybe 18 months or 2 years and started to get a little bit bored. Well one of the reasons you are bored is that you feel like you are not learning. You are doing the same thing today as you were 2 or 3 years ago.", "So if you know you\u2019ve got someone who is motivated by continually developing, then you\u2019ve always got to be showing them what are the things they can grow towards, projects or experiences that you can give them, that make them feel like they are developing. If you are giving them some new experiences on one hand, with the other you can probably give them a bit more of the stuff they do already and expect them to work a little bit harder.", "And the last intrinsic motivator is purpose. Why are you here? What do you actually turn up to work for? What do you actually want to be in life? And that purpose could be serving my customers. It could be serving society. It could be that my purpose from a personal perspective is that I don\u2019t want to be poor when I\u2019m old. I\u2019m tremendously motivated by that. But the key for me, and where I was always lucky, is that I was able to share that with my manager. If I had a bad week, my manager would always say, \u201cyou are not going to get that bonus\u201d. If I had a bad month, my manager would always say, \u201cWhat can we do to help you Alex? What can we do to help you grow? How can we incentivise you to do that?\u201d.\u00a0But if I was having a bad quarter, or a bad 6 months, money, status, competition really didn\u2019t mean anything for me.", "But my manager knew that I was incentivised by growing. She knew I was bored easily. So when I was demotivated in my job, we would seek to reinvent my job. How can I get myself a bit more autonomy? So maybe if I hit X and Y target, then maybe she gives more space day to day where she doesn\u2019t come at the end of everyday and check all my calls or my activity.\u00a0", "It could be that she gets me to do new things, so maybe do some talks to other departments, gives me the opportunity to travel to other parts of the business. But gives me opportunities to expand my mind a little bit more and feel like I\u2019m progressing.", "But the key for you as a listener and a watcher is, do you know what makes every person in your team tick? Because if you don\u2019t know why they turn up to work everyday, if you don\u2019t know what they want to spend their money on, if you don\u2019t know what they want out of life, it\u2019s really, really, really difficult to get them to want to do things, because you don\u2019t know what they are going to get out of it. The clearer you are about what they will get out of it, the easier it is to (subtly) connect doing A will help give them B. That is the art of this. It\u2019s easy to use day to day, but the art is making sure that they don\u2019t see the process you are going through and all they feel is that you are trying to give them what they want.", "This insight video is part of the\u00a0", "Conducting Motivational 1-2-1 Review Meetings", " course.", "Alex Moyle has been helping people with their careers for 20 years.\u00a0 \u00a0He spent 15 years at one of the world's largest recruitment agencies as a recruiter, manager and director.\u00a0\u00a0", "\n\t\tPower Up\t", "\n\t\t", "\n\t", "\n", "\n\t\tPower Up\t", "\n\t\t", "\n\t", "\n", "\n\t\tPower Up\t", "\n\t\t", "\n\t", "\n", "\n            \n            \u00a9 Copyright 2020 Careercake Limited |\n            Registered in England & Wales No: 09715695 |\n            ", "Privacy & Cookie Policy", " |\n            ", "Terms of Use", "\n          ", "With Clara Wilcox", "\n\t\tPower Up\t", "\n\t\t", "\n\t", "\n", "Get unlimited access wherever you are; 24/7", "Custom learning paths tailored to you", "Delivered by leading experts", "Let Clara Wilcox guide you through how to pitch yourself for a job when you THINK you don\u2019t have all the skills.

Let\u2019s face it, there is a lot of language, a lot of acronyms and terminology involved, which can make it seem really difficult as a subject area. People\u2019s fear of offending or saying the wrong thing, can sometimes prevent them from engaging at all. I think that I have a responsibility to make people feel comfortable enough to ask questions, by creating safe spaces for conversations or acknowledging to others how very complicated it can all seem. You might have noticed that I have used the acronym LGBT throughout and yet there are many organisations and people, that use LGBTQ (to include Queer or Questioning)", "LGBT+ (to include a range of other identities) and several other acronyms are used too.

For example, when asking people about their personal life, instead of saying girlfriend/boyfriend, husband or wife, why not simply say \u2018partner\u2019? This sends a clear message that you haven\u2019t made an assumption and creates the opportunity for someone to open up if they wish to.", "I would also encourage you to listen out for cues. It may well be the case that someone is considering coming out and is trying to open up to you. In which case, if you are tuned in to what are people are saying, you might well be able to make the process easier for them. In my experience, in the early stages of coming out, an individual will often seek out just one or two people to confide in. This is part of the process of learning to trust people and plays a big part in someone developing their confidence to come out more publicly. Perhaps you can be that friend, that trusted individual? If so, you can play a significant part in helping them on their journey to becoming truly out and visible at work.

Because you are nervous, you are now showing everybody that you care about this. We only get nervous if things matter to us, so that is a good thing. We want that interviewer and those people we meet to know that this matters to us. That is going to be impressive, so don\u2019t beat yourself up about being nervous, it\u2019s a good thing. What we do want to do however, is find that balance so that these nerves are not crippling us.", "So, the first thing I\u2019m going to ask you to do is prepare. And now you are sitting here watching this video thinking, \u2018you want me to prepare, that\u2019s obvious\u2019. But I do want you to prepare and I know that every blog on this topic tells you to do that, but have you really done it. Because I always say to people, \u2018yeah I know that\u2019, but do I actually do it? Not always. So make sure that when you are preparing, because that is, without s doubt, the best way for you to deal with your nerves, make sure that you are saying these answers out loud. The reason being, when we are in a position where we are really aware of our surroundings.", "We are feeling a little uncomfortable and maybe a bit nervous, our breath is getting a bit fast, we are getting a bit sweaty and panicky, to just be really comfortable and remember what it is that we want to portray in our interview answers, it can be a little bit difficult, but if you are used to saying them out loud, they will just flow naturally. Even in a nervous state. And just to prove that point, I promise you, sometimes you will hear a song you haven\u2019t heard for ten years. You haven\u2019t heard it but you can still remember all of the words. It\u2019s because your body is used to saying them because you sing them. So practice your interview answers out loud. Whether you are driving your car, hovering, annoying all your friends because you are in the kitchen talking to yourself it seems. Just do it, I promise you it will help.", "The next things are to get familiar with the people, if you can. Look for any opportunity you can to meet anybody, and not just the people who are interviewing you, anybody who works there, before your interview. That will help. Like one of my friends today was telling me (I told him I was making this video) he said, \u2018oh my goodness, I had an interview a few years ago and I took a drive there on a Sunday, drove around, even got out of the car and looked through the window, so that on the day, that building, this place was already familiar to me and helped me with my nerves\u2019. Get familiar and do a drive by if you can.", "The next thing, surround yourself with a lighter about an hour before your interview. I\u2019m not asking you to go out there and light some candles, a lighter is someone who makes you feel incredible. We all have a lighter in our lives, hopefully. Maybe it\u2019s our mum, dad, boyfriend, girlfriend, colleague or a mentor. Somebody who can make you feel like you can take over the world. That person. I want you to schedule a call if you can, or even a meet up face to face if you can, about an hour before your interview. If you can get your mind-set straight. If you can feel like you\u2019re invincible and you can do this, it will impact everything that you do in that interview. Your headspace and the way you portray yourself is just as important as the world that come out of your mouth, so work on that.", "\u00a0", "Another little tip, speak to someone about a problem that you know the answer to. So maybe take that work call with that customer you know you can help or that colleague who is really struggling with something and you know, on this topic, you are the expert. If you can elevate yourself just before the interview, again, it will help your confidence and your mind-set. Even if it is nothing to do with work. Even if it is a friend who is going through a really bad time at the moment and you want to be able to help them. It will make you feel valued and you are going to go in that room feeling a little bit kick-ass. That\u2019s a good thing.", "\u00a0", "The next thing, music. Music is so powerful. Music helps us feel things and we do not use it enough. Music makes us spend loads of money at Christmas when you go into the shops and they are playing Christmas carols and they want you to get your wallet out. When you go into certain shops they\u2019ve got pumping tunes playing because they want you to think about Friday night when you are going clubbing so you\u2019ll buy some new outfits. They sue it in adverts, movies. It makes us cry at the MasterCard advert (I\u2019m such a soppy one and I love that advert, it always gets me). Do you sue music to effect your mood? You should.", "\u00a0", "Think about your game song. What\u2019s your game song? Your game song, again, is a song that makes you feel amazing. I have, Rolling Stones, sympathy for the devil. Its little bit arrogant. Mick Jagger has got that arrogance and sometimes I need to fee off that. What\u2019s your game song? And your game song can be anything. It can be the spice girls, that\u2019s fine or it could be something super cool I haven\u2019t even heard of. It\u2019s that song that when it comes on you are like, \u2018Yeah!\u2019. Play it. Maybe even get a playlist together. Listen to it. Use music.", "\u00a0", "The next thing I want to give you some advice on id breathing. This is something that has only come to be late in my life. It was one of those things I\u2019d heard about, but never did it. If you can use breathing exercises beforehand, for about twenty minutes before your interview, I promise you\u2026this isn\u2019t just fluffy advice, this stuff works. I breathe in for four and hold for two and I do that four or five times. I do that when I\u2019m doing key note speeches, when I\u2019ve got a really big business meeting. I still get nervous and breathing is a big one for me.", "\u00a0", "The next thing is, be careful how you are talking to yourself. There is a lovely quote, be careful how you talk to yourself, because you are listening. It\u2019s so true. If you tell yourself that you are about to mess this up, you\u2019re going to mess this up. You need to tell yourself positive things, because what we think, we become. You don\u2019t want this incident whereby you are telling yourself, this is going to be a nightmare, I\u2019m going to mess it up. Because now you are just in a negative head mess and nothing good can come from that. Start visualising what would happen and how it feels when you have finished that interview and you have had a lovely, wonderful conversation with them. They like you, you like them and you re feeling like you want to work there. Visualise a positive outcome. What does it feel like? How are you feeling when you are driving home? Really get yourself in that head space.", "\u00a0", "The next thing I want you to do is don\u2019t apologise. If you are in the interview and you feel \u2018I\u2019m still a little bit nervous\u2019. Again, go back to the visualisation thing and visualise the positivity. But if you are in that room and you are feeling a little bit nervous, don\u2019t apologise for it. What you do when you say, \u2018sorry, I\u2019m a little bit nervous\u2019 is you are drawing attention to it and no everyone in the room is focusing on the one thing you didn\u2019t really want to focus on, because you brought it up. And now as an interviewer, I\u2019m nervous because I don\u2019t want you to feel nervous and I\u2019m apologising to you. I don\u2019t want to make anyone feel uncomfortable. That\u2019s not my game plan. So now I feel a little bit on edge. We don\u2019t want that kind of dynamic in the room.

My first point being, please remember this, the interviewer gets nervous too. Not all of them, but a lot of them. You wouldn\u2019t believe in business show many people get asked to go out and interview perspective new employees and they\u2019ve never had any interview training. No-one has ever told them how to be a good interviewer. They just get asked to go and interview somebody. They do get nervous too. I\u2019ve been in this game over fifteen years. The amount of people I\u2019ve had to go and speak to to do training because they get nervous and they want to be the best interviewer they can be. There are loads of them. I remember one guy a couple of years ago who owned an accountancy practice. Really smart, lovely man. When he got nervous he said he had verbal diarrhoea. He said awkward things and it probably made people not want to be around him. I actually loved him because of this. How socially awkward he was, was one of my favourite things about him. But he didn\u2019t want to portray himself like that in an interview and he knows that in interviews he gets nervous. I went in and helped him with the interview and he sat there and made some notes and chipped in now and again, but I ran the interview, because he was too nervous to do it and that was his own business. So just remember that.", "The next thing and I just want to end of this, you\u2019re interviewing them too. This isn\u2019t just, I\u2019m going to go into this room and are they going to like me? Think, I\u2019m going into this room now and am I going to like them? Because you\u2019re giving that business and opportunity. You\u2019re giving that business your time and your time is just as valuable as their time. So, get a bit of that power back and think this is a two-way process. This isn\u2019t just them judging you. This is a two way, am I going to want to work with them, just as much as are they going to want to work with me. Take that power and remember the value that you bring \u2013 really important.", "Ok, hopefully that\u2019s helped.

They find resilience by moving towards something beyond themselves \u2013 a goal, getting a job, leaving a job, finding love. They transcend that pain, hurt, upset, grief as they know bad times are only temporary and that they are in control.", "In this sense, resilience is the ability to thrive in a word full of uncertainty. There will be tough times we will get knock backs, there will be tragedy and trauma and threats in our lives. Things which bring pain and cause stress. I am sure you can recall how it feels when you experience loss, grief, rejection. When you didn\u2019t get the job you had dreamt of or the promotion you had worked so hard for. It really can be hard to see a way forward. But with time we can recover from these difficulties and this \u201cbouncing back\u201d is what resilience is.", "Being resilient does not mean that a person doesn\u2019t experience difficulty or distress. Emotional pain and sadness are common in people who have suffered major adversity or trauma in their lives. In fact, the road to resilience is likely to involve considerable emotional distress.", "But importantly, resilience is not a trait that people either have or do not have. It involves behaviors, thoughts, and actions that can be learned and developed by absolutely anyone, by you, and in this day and age, in times of change, growth, knock backs \u2013 it is becoming increasingly important for us all to build our resilience skills.", "Let\u2019s look at resilience in action.", "What do Oprah Winfrey, Emily Blunt, The Beatles and J.K.Rowling all have in common? And no, this isn\u2019t the beginning of a corny joke. They are people we probably all deem to be very successful, but they have all demonstrated resilience at different times in their lives.", "Oprah Winfrey. Everyone knows Oprah. She is one of the most iconic faces on TV as well as one of the most richest and most successful women in the world. But, she faced a very hard road to get to that position. She endured a rough and often abusive childhood as well as numerous career setbacks, including being fired from her job as a television reporter because she was \u201cunfit for TV.\u201d But she kept going! This lady demonstrates resilience like absolutely no other!", "Emily Blunt. Between the ages of 7-14 Emily actually had a major stutter. She then tried out for a school play and she worked on different accents and voices to help her get her words out and she ended up overcoming her stutter to allow her to be the award winning actor she is today.", "The Beatles. Well, this band actually need no introduction at all, but that could have been really different had they listened to one of the first record companies they went to, who told them \u201cno\u201d, saying they didn\u2019t like their sound and that guitar music was on its way out.

The introverts\u2019 pathway was longer, taking in the frontal areas of the brain associated with problem solving and planning: introverts were focused on their internal worlds. By contrast, the extroverts\u2019 pathway was much shorter and flowed to the sensory parts of the brain: the extroverts were focussed on the world around them.", "The different pathways followed were linked to different neurotransmitters.

And you might be thinking, surely they should roll up and do a good job because I pay them a base salary. Well, no, because what a base salary gets you is someone turning up and doing a job. If you want someone to do a brilliant job, you need to unlock their discretionary effort and that is the effort they have got to give if they feel super engaged in what they are doing.", "And so, what that means is that you can\u2019t really make anyone do anything. Well you sort of can if you are standing over them, but most of you will be in teams where people still have to work hard when you are not there. So the art of a motivating meeting is that when your back is turned, they are still going to be working as hard as when you are there. And that is truly a test of whether a team is working well. And in some ways it\u2019s a little bit like if you are in sales. Customers can buy when you are there, but when they leave the shop do they cancel? Do they bring it back? Do they ever come back to you again? And so what we\u2019ve got to focus on as a manager, is actually getting people to want to buy what we want them to do rather than actually selling them. People love to buy and so what we have to be connected with is each individual\u2019s motivators, so we can sell and promote what we need people to do in a way that matches what that person's needs and is motivated by.", "Let\u2019s look at how individuals are motivated. Now, there are loads of different theories and philosophies around what motivates people. My personal favourite I use when I train people is the self determination theory. What that does is put motivators into two buckets, which keeps things simple. And so one bucket is extrinsic motivators. Extrinsic motivators are things that I get from an external body if I do something. For instance, if I hit a target, I maybe get a pay rise or I maybe get on a leaderboard. And then you\u2019ve got intrinsic motivators which are things I do because I want to feel better inside. And so the extrinsic motivators we are going to go through are probably more short term and the intrinsic ones are often the deeper things that inspire longer lasting behaviour.", "So extrinsic motivators. Firstly, status with managers or family. There are some people in your team who are motivated by your boss and your bosses boss thinking they are really good and you know as soon as that boss is coming into town, they are going to start working harder. Or it could be that they are motivated by showing their parents that they are standing on their own two feet, or they are able to have a job that is professional, credible and give them the status they want in life.", "The other form of status is status with your peers and friends. A lot of people are motivated by their friends thinking, \u201cwell, do you have a decent job?\u201d. I know when I entered the career workplace, all my friends became doctors, lawyers and accountants and I became a recruitment consultant. So, I was desperate to prove that my job was as credible as theirs. They were going to have letters after their name and I did a job that wasn\u2019t always very popular in the world.", "The other area of extrinsic motivators is competition. There are some individuals who love to be on a league table. They live to get recognition for doing things better than everybody else. Hence a lot of firms now are implementing peer to peer recognition systems that allow people to go,\u201d Cheers you just did me a good job\u201d. Because the pep of that motivation is what keeps a lot of people going. And the last area of intrinsic motivation is money or inquisitiveness. There are a lot of people who are motivated to work hard so they can buy a car, go on holiday, buy a handbag, shoes football season tickets, houses, pensions. And so when you understand someone is money motivated, it\u2019s really important that you don\u2019t just take money as an answer, but you are asking what they want to spend that money on.", "My manager would always ask, \u201cOK, you want a bonus, but what are you going to spend that money on?\u201d. Some months it was, I want to buy a home cinema. Other months I wanted to buy a car and as I got older I wanted to buy a house. But all of those things, my manager knew about and they could then could then use them as tools when I was feeling down and not doing what I need to do, to jeer me on a bit and increase that motivation.", "However, if you want long lasting change, intrinsic motivation is where you are going to get the biggest difference. And the three intrinsic motivators are firstly, autonomy. The desire to be autonomous in our work. The desire to be left alone and make decisions for ourselves (the decisions we think are right) in order to do the job as well as we can.", "The next area is mastery. That inner desire to feel like we are wanting to improve. Many of you watching this video will have sometimes been in a job for maybe 18 months or 2 years and started to get a little bit bored. Well one of the reasons you are bored is that you feel like you are not learning. You are doing the same thing today as you were 2 or 3 years ago.", "So if you know you\u2019ve got someone who is motivated by continually developing, then you\u2019ve always got to be showing them what are the things they can grow towards, projects or experiences that you can give them, that make them feel like they are developing.

Certainly, the new skill base is a different area of expertise. So, [from] something that you've become very comfortable in to being very uncomfortable in. It's a real change in skill base. I think if individuals recognise entirely that everyone has to start somewhere, that most people are not recruited into a job like that because they are deemed to be the finished article, but someone who has the skills to start, but is probably more of a blank canvas that could be moulded - that can be developed to be the type of person that they need in that position. If people recognise that, as well as recognise that everyone's going to fail at some things and that it's safe to do so in most environments.", "Aimee:", " That\u2019s key for so many things, isn't it?", "Mark:", "\u00a0 It is. People have got to feel comfortable knowing where their limitations are, so they can put plans in place to develop themselves. And not enough people do that and that's where people become unstuck. I think the people who will typically fail when they go into a leadership role for the first time are either those that don't really recognise their own limitations - I wouldn't use the word arrogance, but they overly assume that they're going to be great at it, that there's not going to be any issues. People like that typically fail because they haven't asked for help or they haven't recognised the areas that they need to develop or they've set themselves up to fail by not recognising that it's going to be difficult and that most people absolutely don't start off in a place where they're going to excel in that leadership role straightaway.", "Aimee:", " What about you? What was your first management job like?", "Mark:", "\u00a0 My first management role was particularly difficult. I was particularly young. I think I was 23 when I first started. I\u2019ve been doing HR forever. So, I was young when I went into my first HR leadership position and it was difficult because the business circumstances were difficult. I wasn't in a situation where I could overthink my role as a manager\u00a0", "Aimee:", " and what do you mean by difficult?", "Mark:", " It was just a business that was undergoing significant change.", "Aimee:", " So the culture, people's moods, were a little bit \u2026", "Mark:", " Yes, it was quite unstable. There was a lot happening in the global economy at the time, so we had to pull people together. It was an all hands-on deck situation and that was it. I think I succeeded and have gone on from there because of the level of resilience I showed early on. Touch wood, things will probably never be that difficult again. I think what I learned from my very first management job was that I didn't have time to pretend to be an excellent manager. I absolutely needed to recognise that I was going to be okay at it. That, you know, I wasn't going to be perfect at everything, but I was going to learn and also just entirely recognise that those that were working for knew that I wasn't some sort of God - that I was going to come in and be amazing - was fallible like everyone else. That I wasn't the finished article and that they were going to help me learn as much as I was going to help them through leading them.", "Aimee:", " A lot of people, \u2026, like you for example, did you work with them before you became [their manager]?", "Mark:", " I did, yeah.", "Aimee:", " Okay, so it's the whole \u2013 you\u2019re mates with them on the Friday, might even have been down the pub having beers with them, and then Monday comes, and I know a lot of our viewers, a lot of our audience come back and say \u201cI'm a new manager. How on earth do I talk to them? Because they were my mates last week\u201d. And they are still your mates, but how do you deal with the fact that you are their line manager now?", "Mark:", " I think a lot of that is to do with psychological barriers. We have to recognise now that we're in a different position and therefore there is this different psychological barrier between a manager and a person who works for them. That does exist. There's no two ways about it. You know that person has elevated to another position with a different set of accountabilities and responsibilities, so they are in a different role. There is a difference.", "Aimee:", " So firstly, accept that. When you're thinking, \u201coh no I haven't changed. I'm still me.\u201d You are still you, but recognise ...", "Mark:", " Recognise that that difference exists. But I also think it's about doing so in the context of what's changing. There's this misconception that you have to become this different person - manager Mark is different to non-manager Mark. Well, actually, I'm 99% the same person. I now have to do different things and act in a slightly different way. I think if you pretend to be someone else, then people will absolutely see through that and it makes the job more difficult. So, I think remaining authentic and staying who you are is really important, because actually, who you are is the reason why you've just been promoted, because they recognise the skills. I think you have to recognise that you're in a different position and that there is a barrier that's now being created or rather a change in dynamic. But also, don't take it too seriously. And don't forget who you are, because who you are is why you\u2019ve got to where you've got to.", "Aimee:", " Is there a real life example you could provide of what does change and what has to stay the same? So when you say authentic, does that mean that you can go to your team and say \u201cI'm really stressed today at how to do this\u201d which is what you might have done week ago when they were your peers?", "Mark:", " I think it is difficult. I think there are absolutely some things now that it's probably best to confide in your line managers than those that report to you. They need to have confidence that you know what you're doing. You\u2019ll get that leeway first of all when you\u2019re first in that job because people recognise that as your first job. There is a level of changing who you would confide in about self-development at work and that sort of thing. I think you would go to your line manager instead of discussing that with the people who report to you. But having said that, they are people who will know where your areas of development are. They would have worked with you and now they work for you and they'll know where you need to develop and where you need to improve. So, it's not going to be a completely new concept to them that there are areas to develop. But some of the big issues that I've experienced certainly at one point in time, I was providing an HR management service to an engineering workshop. I remember one of the managers saying \u201cYou know, I used to go every Friday for drinks after work, I can't do that anymore. I'm not allowed to do that. Now I'm the manager, you know, just in case.\u201d And I just remember saying, \u201cWell why, why can't you?\u201d You're still their friend it\u2019s just that you're held to a different standard now. Things you may have turned a blind eye to before you; you can't anymore. But it doesn't mean that you've become this different person and that you need to exclude yourself and create these gaping big barriers. Just recognise that there's a slight barrier and that you need to manage that in the best way you can.", "Aimee:", " So maybe go out for those drinks, but it depends on, I suppose, how big those drinks get \u2013 you end up clubbing at two in the morning - so are you going out for these drinks? Maybe, but if you know it's going to get a little bit cray, then you might just go home even if you want to stay and have loads of fun. Because you have to, I suppose, keep making sure that you create, or you have boundaries where you can still be there for them, but then know that if you need to have a difficult conversation, at any point that there's going to be a level of respect there. That respect is a two way thing.", "Mark:", " Absolutely, they're going to hold you to a different standard as well as you holding yourself to that different standard. So, it does help to maintain a good level of professionalism. You can remain professional whilst still remaining friendly, relatable. These are people you may have something in common with and you can still talk to John every Thursday like you normally do, about what happened on the game on the weekend. You know that you haven't become a different person. It is about knowing when you want to \u2018de-expose\u2019 yourself from these situations.", "Aimee:", " But still enjoy those wonderful relationships that you\u2019ve built.", "Mark:", " Definitely, yeah.", "Aimee:", " What if you're going into a job, [in] a new organisation, you haven't worked with them before and you are becoming more senior to people that might have actually applied for that job or they might be older than you. This this something that a lot of our Careercake community ask about. They\u2019re now in a position where they're managing people that are older than them. 90% of the time, if not more, these people don\u2019t have an issue with that at all. But in your head, you think it's going to be an issue. What advice would you give to a new manager that's going in fresh?", "Mark:", "\u00a0I've been in that exact same situation. When you started your management career, as young as I was when I started, nearly everyone who reported to me was always older than me, and it was an issue early on, [but] only ever an issue to me. It was only ever something that, in my mind, I thought was going to be a problem. And you know what? It never ever was. It never resulted in anyone saying, yeah, but he's only 20 something. It just never actually turned into anything. So, the way I get past it now, there's no scientific method or anything is that, \u201cWell it's never happened before so it's probably never going to happen at all\u201d. I just think it's just recognising that, you know, it's an old fashioned concern that doesn't really happen in most modern workplaces. The world has moved on. When you're new to an organisation in a more senior role \u2013 it was interesting you asked about actually going into a role that people you're working with may have applied for and not being successful in. I get that that is a difficult situation and you are quite often on trial by the people who didn't get the job because they want to know why you've had it and they didn't. What have you got that they haven't? I think the only way that you can combat that, really, is to not change. It\u2019s to act exactly the way you were going to act. Irrespective of that, that's a nuance that doesn't really need to be considered as a way of over emphasising or over egging the pudding in terms of how you're going to apply yourself and work with that person.", "Aimee:", " Would you ever have a conversation with that person [about it]?", "Mark:", " Only if it ever became an issue. Only if it was something that person had said, that person may approach the subject in a very professional way and say to you, \u201cLook, you know, just to let you know, I applied for that job and I didn't get it. It's a bit raw with me at the moment\u201d and you may say, \u201cWell look, I appreciate you coming to me and discussing\u201d And you just acknowledge it. \u201cThank you. Look. It's not going to be a problem. Look, it is me that was chosen, but what I can do is I can work with you to give you the skills to help you, if this opportunity comes up in future so that you'd be a stronger candidate.\u201d That's one great way of dealing with that situation. But you also get the others who may not ever be fully on board because \u201cYou've just waltzed in here and had my job\u201d, and all this sort of thing. And again, if that was a problem or it did manifest itself in a bigger problem, I would absolutely call it out. And I would speak to that person and say \u201cLook, you know, I understand that it's an issue for you. It is what it is, and we now need to find a way of working together successfully\u201d. That person may be really valued at what they do. I think it's about recognising that and saying \u201cYou're an integral member of my team, but this is an unfortunate situation. We need to get past that\u201d and ask them \u201cWhat can we do to move beyond this?\u201d", "Aimee:", " That\u2019s great advice - Call it out. Don't hide from it and have that conversation. So, our viewers might be getting a new job as a manager and they might be feeling like a little bit of a fraudster. Like, \u201cI don't know how I got here. Am I good enough for this?\u201d Especially when you\u2019re going through the day, where you're being challenged and you feel like you're a bit of a failure, you go to bed at night, and you know deep down that that's part of the growth process. That's how you get better at stuff. But it's still feeling like they going to find out are and they are going to tell me that they made a mistake. So, talk about that.", "Mark:", " We used to call it self-doubt. That\u2019s all it used to be - I'm suffering with a bit of self-doubt or crisis of confidence and all this sort of thing. These days it\u2019s more recognised or, or more defined by people generally as something called imposter syndrome. Imposter syndrome is where people do feel like a fraud at work. They feel that they are absolutely going to be found out at some point in time because they don't really believe, or they don't feel that they should be in the position that they're in, that they're very fortunate to be there and that there's someone else who's more qualified to do the job. That feeling of imposter syndrome is quite often baseless or it\u2019s just human nature to feel that way.\u00a0", "Aimee:", " Is it human nature for everyone or is it just certain types of people?", "Mark:", " Most people, I would say. Imposter syndrome, generally, is talked about a lot at the moment. It's very popular as a term at the moment because now people have a term to refer to. So politicians are speaking a lot about imposter syndrome. Sports people are talking a lot. Celebrities and business people - imposter syndrome is very popular. In its early days, studies into imposter syndrome showed that it was more prevalent in women than men, but in more recent studies it's becoming that men and women both suffer with imposter syndrome. But in the early studies it was identified more as something that affected females.", "Aimee:", " I\u2019d heard that and certainly back in my career when it started 15 years ago that if you ever wanted to talk about some of this, it was always female facilitators. It was something that, you know, and it's like absolutely not [just women].", "Mark:", " No, not anymore. No. I suffer with imposter syndrome frequently. (", "Aimee:", " That was going to be my next question). Yeah, I do. (", "Aimee:", " Cos you\u2019re awesome) (", "Mark:", " Thank you very much) (", "Aimee:", " And you feel like that at times?)", "Mark:", " In the car on the way here this morning - \u201cWhy am I being interviewed?\u201d I think the way in which I overcome imposter syndrome, when I do get it, is, I've been asked to do this because of something; because of other things that I do or other things that I've said or my professional credentials or whatever it may be. I think it is just a way of dealing with impostor syndrome is recognising why you're in that position in the first place. So, if someone is suffering with imposter syndrome, when they are first appointed into a new role, it's worth than just recognising that someone saw something in them to give them that new job", "Aimee:", " You didn\u2019t win a raffle.", "Mark:", " No, exactly. You've earned that opportunity to get there. And because you've earned that opportunity to get there, then you are not an imposter. I think the next thing is just recognising, that the people who chose me to be here also know that I'm not the finished article and they'll know that there are areas for me to develop. So when imposter syndrome is constant or when it affects people to the extent that they're constantly thinking about it, what I would try and do is look at the root cause I would absolutely try and drill into the particular issue, that I think I'm an imposter because - so I guess it might be -\u00a0 I'm feeling this way every time I need to do this or I feel this way every time I'm invited to a meeting or I feel this way every time I need to go on a course or something like that. Because if you can do that, it's kind of like diagnosing the cause. If I'm feeling this way, when that happens, why is that? And sometimes it's worth recognising in a one to one with a manager or in a performance review saying \u201cI keep having this. Why do you think that is? Is that something you recognise in me? Is there a way in which we can try and overcome that?\u201d and sometimes it's absolutely a conversation that someone can have with their manager, where they've got that relationship to have it with them.", "Aimee:", " I'm going to press you on that, and I totally agree with you, but I know that I've had this in the past. I know some people would say that \u201cThey've just promoted me. So, they're the last person that I want to think that I can't do that.\u201d What would you say [to that]?", "Mark: I would say they probably haven't promoted you thinking that you're the finished article. They've promoted you knowing that you have a core set of skills and you have a range of different expertise and you bring something to the party that no one else that they interviewed, brought to the party. They have faith and they have confidence in you. That doesn't mean they think you're the finished article.", "Aimee:", " No one is.", "Mark:", " Exactly. So I think going to them to say, \u201cLook, I'm doing well in these areas. My team morale is great.\u00a0 I've got people doing exactly what they need to do. This resulted in this, but I've got this niggling doubt and I need to do something about this or I keep thinking about this. Is there a better way that I can approach it?\u201d And I think managers more often than not, certainly the ones I speak to, when they are dealing with ultimate failure, which is, you know, someone who is really underperforming in their job, more often than not, the manager will say to me, \u201cIf only they'd come to me and asked for help\u201d.", "Aimee:", " I would have loved that. Yeah, I would have loved it if they'd come and asked. That's the attitude that you're looking for, isn't it? That person that wants to be a sponge, wants to learn, wants to progress.", "Mark:", " But people often either don't do it or they do it too late. And I think if there is a learning need, it's absolutely worth exploring that with the line manager because, just because you're recognising one learning need, doesn't mean you're very poor at everything else.", "Aimee:", " As a new manager, how important is it, and are you able to spot imposter syndrome in your team and the people that you're leading?", "Mark:", " It is very difficult to spot imposter syndrome in others because imposter syndrome is, is a way that someone feels. And it's very easy to hide. You just bury it deep down and focus on other things and just do stuff.", "Aimee:", " And that's why you\u2019re so surprised isn\u2019t it? When people like you \u2026 I know there was a CEO of an amazing organisation that I was lucky enough to be asked to go to the AGM, and the CEO, employs 3000 people and she has one opportunity to talk to people. But she used her 30 minutes to talk about the fact that she's crippled by imposter syndrome.", "Mark:", " I think it's very difficult to spot, but a great way of coming at it from a different angle is by, as a manager, making that environment at work a place where people can feel as if they can come forward to you. So, if you can't identify it in others or if you have a feeling that someone may be feeling that way, but you can't quite pin anything on it, one of the best things a manager can do, not just for imposter syndrome, but anyway, to create maximum productivity in their team, is just by making that environment a safe and healthy place for them to work, and to work on that relationship with the people who work with them, for them, where they can make their team members feel able to come and speak to them about anything. And if you've built up that level of trust, if you've built up that level of respect, then when people have those conversations with you, imposter syndrome may be one of those subjects that they talk about. I think that's a really healthy way of forging good working relationships with the people around you. I think gone are the days where people would just see managers as god-like figures and people see employees as machines that don't have emotions, in most businesses. I think people connect now on a much more human level and humans absolutely have areas where they need to develop and need reassurance and need to feel valued and need to feel like they've got a place to work where they can talk about stuff that they need to talk about that.", "Aimee:", " Absolutely. So, you talked a little bit there about trust. How important is trust and building trust? How'd you do that with your new team?", "Mark:", " It's really, really important because if you can't build trust with your team, then they're not going to come to you and they're not going to give you their best selves basically. And you're not going to be able to perform in your role as best you can if your team are distrusting of you. But there's a big difference between being distrusted and being trusted. The best way of building trust with your team is genuinely by being a trustworthy individual, it\u2019s by following up on your actions. It's by listening to people. It is about listening to any concerns that they have and trying to support them and help them with it.", "Aimee:", " So, if you say you're going to do something, do it. Don't over promise when you might not have the authority to approve certain things.", "Mark:", " It's about recognising that people in your teams will need help, will need assistance and that you're there to support them. You're not there to catch them out doing something wrong because some times, a distrusting individual will think that the reason something's being done is because \u201cThey're trying to catch me out\u201d. I'm here to help you and support you because working together, we're going to give this organisation the best chance of success at whatever the organisation does.", "Aimee:", " What part does vulnerability play in that? I suppose you're saying that it's difficult to spot imposter syndrome in the people that work with you. So foster an environment where they feel they can talk to you if they're struggling and be vulnerable. I suppose you really need to trust somebody, your manager, in order to go to them and say, \u201cI'm struggling or I'm feeling like I'm not the best person for this. Are you sure I should be doing, you know, all of that stuff?\u201d So how important is it for you to show your own vulnerability with your team and what, what would that balance even look like?", "Mark:", " I think that's a very personal scale. I would say for individuals. Is it important to show your vulnerability? Probably, in the right context, at the right time. Maybe not for everyone. I think what's really key is just making sure that people recognise that I'm human, you're human and together we are trying to do something as humans. I know that sounds pink and fluffy, but ultimately, people need to relate to you. They may relate to you because you're just as vulnerable as they are. They may relate to you because you just as confident as they are. There may be a number of different ways. I think some of the best managers that I've worked for have been people that I've related to and they've known how to work with me, and I've known how to work with them. If you can build that relationship, demonstrating where you may have come across similar situations to what they've experienced before, that you may have felt the way that they feel right now, maybe you still feel that way, then you\u2019re creating that relationship by demonstrating that actually we've got stuff in common and it's easier to manage people who are able to relate. They don't need necessarily need to have things in common with you. The worst thing in the world that you want, as a manager, is to have a team of people that are all identical. You will lack and lose diversity of thought, but you want to be able to have a good solid working relationship with them and there is going to be common ground there and vulnerability can be one of those areas of common ground.", "Aimee:", " If you could give 23 year old Mark Hendy, that just got his first management job in an environment that wasn't that cushty, what advice would you give yourself?", "Mark:", " Don't buy that car that I bought when I was 23! I would probably give myself the advice of not taking myself so seriously. I think I fell into the trap in my first management role of thinking I needed to be someone else and thinking that I couldn't have a laugh and a joke anymore. And I became quite miserable, really. And I thought this isn't me anymore. So, I very quickly reverted back to previous Mark. But I took on board the management skills that I knew I needed to be effective in that job. So, I think it's just absolutely don't take yourself too seriously. Don't think you have to be a different person. Recognise your strengths. Recognise the weaknesses and the areas for development. Do something about it.
