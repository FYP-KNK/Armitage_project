For the 14.5 release we are going to be focusing on improving existing features and cleaning up some of the core of Schoolbox. The two Schoolbox principles we are focusing on are integration and ease of use. To this end our features will be focused on connecting Schoolbox to more systems and making it easier than ever to share your content.", "Increasing numbers of our schools are making the switch to cloud based services such as Google Apps and Microsoft OneDrive.

Initially we will be improving our existing reporting by providing a more comprehensive oversight of students\u2019 results in the form of a rubric and improve existing graphs.", "With the new course builder functionality we can now provide insights into the entire cohort\u2019s progress in real time. We plan to add new reports to show how the cohort and classes are progressing throughout the course, and identify students that may require early additional resources. Underlying all of this, we are continuing our project to bring curriculum mapping into Schoolbox. Long term we see this as crucial to be able to provide insights and recommendations on actual curriculum. Enabling resources to be tagged and student activity to be logged against particular curriculum will give schools the insight they need to continually improve their curriculum delivery. Later in the year we will be creating a Schoolbox Success Report to identify key health indicators and help your school understand where Schoolbox is working and where it may need additional work. In particular we are interested in the perceived value of the system and where that value is currently located or where it may be lacking.", "The resource booking system launched late last year and after an initial slow start has taken off extremely well this year.
