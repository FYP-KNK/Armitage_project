Fields with very low traffic of light planes may use a sod surface. Some runways make use of salt flats.\n", "For pavement designs, borings are taken to determine the subgrade condition, and based on the relative ", "bearing capacity", " of the subgrade, the specifications are established. For heavy-duty commercial aircraft, the pavement thickness, no matter what the top surface, varies from 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) to 4\u00a0ft (1\u00a0m), including subgrade.\n", "Airport pavements have been designed by two methods. The first, ", "Westergaard", ", is based on the assumption that the pavement is an elastic plate supported on a heavy fluid base with a uniform reaction ", "coefficient", " known as the ", "K value", ". Experience has shown that the ", "K", " values on which the formula was developed are not applicable for newer aircraft with very large footprint pressures.\n", "The second method is called the ", "California bearing ratio", " and was developed in the late 1940s. It is an extrapolation of the original test results, which are not applicable to modern aircraft pavements or to modern aircraft ", "landing gear", ". Some designs were made by a mixture of these two design theories. A more recent method is an analytical system based on the introduction of vehicle response as an important design parameter. Essentially it takes into account all factors, including the traffic conditions, service life, materials used in the construction, and, especially important, the dynamic response of the vehicles using the landing area.\n", "Because airport pavement construction is so expensive, manufacturers aim to minimize aircraft stresses on the pavement. Manufacturers of the larger planes design landing gear so that the weight of the plane is supported on larger and more numerous tires. Attention is also paid to the characteristics of the landing gear itself, so that adverse effects on the pavement are minimized. Sometimes it is possible to reinforce a pavement for higher loading by applying an overlay of asphaltic concrete or ", "portland cement", " concrete that is bonded to the original slab. Post-tensioning concrete has been developed for the runway surface. This permits the use of thinner pavements and should result in longer concrete pavement life.

To minimize ", "hydroplaning", " following heavy rain, the pavement surface is usually grooved so that the surface water film flows into the grooves and the peaks between grooves will still be in contact with the aircraft tires.

The most common soft surface types are grass and gravel.\n", "Water runways do not have a type code as they do not have physical markings, and are thus not registered as specific runways.\n", "A runway of at least 6,000\u00a0ft (1,800\u00a0m) in length is usually adequate for ", "aircraft", " weights below approximately 200,000\u00a0lb (91,000\u00a0kg). Larger aircraft including ", "widebodies", " will usually require at least 8,000\u00a0ft (2,400\u00a0m) at sea level and somewhat more at higher ", "altitude", " airports. International widebody flights, which carry substantial amounts of fuel and are therefore heavier, may also have landing requirements of 10,000\u00a0ft (3,000\u00a0m) or more and takeoff requirements of 13,000\u00a0ft (4,000\u00a0m). The ", "Boeing 747", " is considered to have the longest takeoff distance of the more common aircraft types and has set the standard for runway lengths of larger international airports.\n", "At ", "sea level", ", 10,000\u00a0ft (3,000\u00a0m) can be considered an adequate length to land virtually any aircraft. For example, at ", "O'Hare International Airport", ", when landing simultaneously on 4L/22R and 10/28 or parallel 9R/27L, it is routine for arrivals from ", "East Asia", ", which would normally be vectored for 4L/22R (7,500\u00a0ft (2,286\u00a0m)) or 9R/27L (7,967\u00a0ft (2,428\u00a0m)) to request 28R (13,000\u00a0ft (3,962\u00a0m)).

In general, the first letter is allocated by continent and represents a country or group of countries within that continent. The second letter generally represents a country within that region, and the remaining two are used to identify each airport. The exception to this rule is larger countries that have single-letter country codes, where the remaining three letters identify the airport. In either case, and unlike IATA codes, ICAO codes generally provide geographical context. For example, if one knows that the ICAO code for Heathrow is EGLL, then one can deduce that the airport EGGP is somewhere in the UK (it is ", "Liverpool John Lennon Airport", ").
